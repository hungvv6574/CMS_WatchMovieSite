1
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,598
Mom.

2
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,758
There's nothing left.
I'll make you an omelet.

3
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:42,398
No need, Mom.
Go back to sleep.

4
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,919
You must eat the fried fish
with an omelet.

5
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:56,318
- Here you are.
- Thanks, Mom.

6
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:01,239
This is great.

7
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,958
Eat your fill.

8
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:06,078
- Enjoying Mom's omelet?
- Hey, Jiab!

9
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,638
Did I wake you? Sorry!

10
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,038
It's all right.

11
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,598
Can you stay with Mom tomorrow?

12
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:15,198
I have to work.

13
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,398
Try this too.
I made it myself.

14
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,398
My omelet is better!

15
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:26,038
- Let me try this!
- What? Try my dish too!

16
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,839
This is a story of two ages...

17
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,719
an age of knives
and an age of guns.

18
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,558
- Hi, Boss Seng.
- Hi. Guys, let me join you.

19
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,038
Come on!

20
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,078
Watch it!

21
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,638
Take care of him.

22
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,078
Daeng, Jod!
Come help me find some shells!

23
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,918
It's your call, Jod.

24
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,718
Boss Lor wants us in.

25
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,878
Have you said yes?

26
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,478
I've talked to him.

27
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,078
We won't squeeze anyone for cash.

28
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,638
We'll take only from those
who are willing to pay.

29
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:41,318
We'll never suck the blood of the poor.

30
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,878
And especially not the hookers.

31
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:49,398
We've told the girls
at the Seven-Story whorehouse

32
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:53,198
- not to give a penny to anybody!
- Get it?

33
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,998
Stand up.

34
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,838
From now on,

35
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,198
you're not going to pay
a penny to Boss Seng.

36
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,397
Because this whorehouse
is under my watch!

37
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,878
My name is Pu!

38
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:23,998
Those thugs
who extort money from people

39
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:27,678
work for Boss Seng
and his brother Little Tee.

40
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,077
They must be very upset.

41
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,197
Boss Seng has sucked
their blood for years.

42
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:37,438
His time is over.

43
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,838
Daeng, a few days ago
I ran into Boss Seng

44
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,038
and Little Tee near the cinema.

45
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,198
- Here you are.
- Thanks, I'm so beat!

46
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,958
- What's brought you out here?
- Jod...

47
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,678
you've become quite
a hotshot. Hmm?

48
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,037
No, I'm not.

49
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:05,678
We have our rules around here.

50
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,558
New guys can rise only
if old bosses accept them.

51
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:13,918
You and Daeng are doing great,
so I asked you to work for me.

52
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,437
If you're not interested, fine.

53
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,198
But I never thought
you'd step on my toes.

54
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:22,358
Hmm?

55
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,037
Boss Seng...

56
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,278
please let me walk.

57
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:32,797
I'm just a kid!

58
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,677
You used to
kick me around, remember?

59
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,838
And what we took
was just petty money.

60
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,318
You know I have no choice.

61
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,278
If I let you walk,
nobody will take me seriously anymore.

62
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,998
And what I can't forgive...

63
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:56,958
is that you refused to join me,
but now you're Boss Lor's dogs.

64
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,398
It's as good as declaring war. Hmm?

65
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,118
If you choose Boss Seng,
I'll understand.

66
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:25,197
I'll let you choose...

67
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,758
how we'll settle this.

68
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,878
You want to do it now?

69
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,997
I can't see why not.

70
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:39,317
Me neither.

71
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,038
I respect you,

72
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:44,998
so let's do it with our hands tied.

73
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:07,158
I don't know who began this tradition

74
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,078
of a knife fight with the hands tied.

75
00:08:10,238 --> 00:08:13,677
They'd tie their hands
and go at each other.

76
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:16,238
Their fates are bound.

77
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,798
They can't walk way even
if they want to.

78
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,957
You have to stab your enemy to death,
and that's no piece of cake.

79
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,158
Boss!

80
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:37,277
Jod! I'll fucking kill you!

81
00:08:49,358 --> 00:08:50,717
Kill 'em all!

82
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,197
THE GANGSTER

83
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:14,198
THE GANGSTER

84
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:19,318
G.I. BLUES

85
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,078
Daeng and his gang were my regulars.

86
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:23,038
They always boasted
about their exploits,

87
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:24,958
but I didn't know if they were true.

88
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:28,518
I was surprised myself.
I thought, "Is this the famous Daeng?

89
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,877
He's such a good-looking gentleman."

90
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,278
- Pirate tickets!
- Daeng...

91
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,998
Brother Daeng, Brother Jod.

92
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,997
Brother Daeng,
Brother Jod.

93
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:40,318
Boss Lor is stuck in the rain.

94
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:41,918
He sent me to get tickets first.

95
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,838
Please wait a moment.

96
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,998
See, they went at each other
with butcher's knives!

97
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,317
They stabbed like this!

98
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:56,918
Jod was so cool.
He went like... this!

99
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,397
Boss Seng was a sorry pulp.

100
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,718
Then Daeng's gang arrived
and they thrashed Little Tee!

101
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,278
You see...

102
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,438
now there's no gang
more powerful than Daeng's.

103
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,078
You talked as if you'd
seen it with your own eyes.

104
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:15,197
My source is an insider.

105
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:33,597
Boss Lor's here.

106
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:39,918
Hello, Boss.

107
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:43,638
Hi, Boss.

108
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:47,997
Hi, Jod.

109
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:51,758
Let's watch a movie.
Let's go.

110
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:54,518
Trust me.

111
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,078
Oh! Piak.

112
00:10:58,319 --> 00:10:59,477
That's Jod!

113
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:01,878
Shit, Daeng is also here!

114
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:04,717
Man, the coolest guys in town!

115
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,638
Boss Lor too!

116
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:09,958
Hi.

117
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,158
What's going on here today?

118
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:14,078
Don't you know what's
on the program tonight?

119
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,398
Elvis!

120
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:20,637
Let me go first!

121
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,238
What are you doing?!
The movie is starting now!

122
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:39,598
You're a pain in the ass!

123
00:11:57,478 --> 00:12:01,357
Darling, I have to leave you now.

124
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:04,998
I got a transfer order to Okinawa.

125
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:08,317
War is now upon us!

126
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,477
The Japanese are about to attack.
I have to go!

127
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:14,878
We won't see each other
for a long time.

128
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:19,798
Lilly, take care of yourself.
I'll hurry back to you.

129
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,317
Leslie, don't worry about me.

130
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:26,957
Take care, love.
I will be waiting for you!

131
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:29,118
Good luck, baby!

132
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:02,557
I'm Piak, and this is Thong.

133
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:06,838
We're blood brothers,
and this is our empire.

134
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,677
The owner of the cinema
owes my mother a favor,

135
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,597
so he lets us stay here.

136
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,118
Piak...

137
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:33,757
are you sure I can move in here?

138
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:36,557
Sure.

139
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:41,197
The old man owes my mom a favor.

140
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:45,437
Did you see Daeng today?

141
00:13:45,598 --> 00:13:47,277
The bastard is so cool!

142
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:50,198
One day...

143
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:54,197
you and I will be as famous as him.

144
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:56,797
No no!

145
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:00,677
We'll be more famous than him.

146
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:02,317
And we'll take over this place!

147
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,077
The area in Bangkok's Old City

148
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:11,797
The area in Bangkok's Old City

149
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:16,397
around Chinatown
and the Central Station

150
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:23,877
is ruled by various Chinese triads
and local gangsters.

151
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:27,397
Most gold merchants have
underground businesses,

152
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,677
from horse betting to illegal boxing,

153
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:35,038
contraband smuggling,
prostitution and drugs.

154
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:37,197
Their business can't survive

155
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:40,277
without the services from the hooligans.

156
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:42,998
So when young gangs show
they have the guts to fight

157
00:14:43,158 --> 00:14:46,437
they will be recruited
by the triads and the mafia.

158
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:48,797
They run protection rackets

159
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,118
and reap huge benefits
from those dark enterprises.

160
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,198
Piak!

161
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,437
Look! Jod and Daeng!
The whole gang's here!

162
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:03,757
Let's get them some iced coffee.

163
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:09,878
- Jod and Daeng.
- Among the dangerous young men,

164
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:13,397
the hottest gang in town
is Daeng Bireley's.

165
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:19,157
Jod has a heart of steel,

166
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,317
but if you're talking
about recklessness, it's Pu.

167
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:27,797
The gang worked for the Chinese mafia...
Big Boss Macicau.

168
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:31,197
Come on, this is too much!

169
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:34,237
I've been waiting to see him
for two days and not a word!

170
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:37,077
Calm down, chief.

171
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:42,477
You know that lately
Boss hardly has time for us.

172
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:44,637
He only talks to Lor now.

173
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:46,557
- That prick Lor?
- Yes.

174
00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:49,997
He thinks he's a top dog now
because he has Jod and Daeng with him.

175
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,397
Fuck those brats! Scumbags.

176
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:55,197
- You're right.
- Lor is an asshole.

177
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:57,277
So, Mr. Director,

178
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:58,997
do we have a deal?

179
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,917
Can I see her first?

180
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:03,117
What the hell do you want
to see her for?

181
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:05,477
Ploy is one of my girls.

182
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:08,997
Take her, make her
a porn star or something!

183
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:11,277
But I love my movie
like my own child.

184
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,597
I've heard that crap
a thousand times before.

185
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:15,158
Do you love yourself, huh?

186
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:17,237
Where did you get the money
for your last film?

187
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:18,517
That was the last one.

188
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,757
When you lost at the card game,
did I ever ask you to pay?

189
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:23,238
That's another story.

190
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:27,477
Now do we have a deal?

191
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,077
So, headmaster?

192
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,477
Yes, no problem at all.

193
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:34,397
He's such a lovely
and intelligent boy.

194
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:38,077
Our school is honored
to have him as our new student.

195
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:42,077
Okay, ma'am, it's done.

196
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:45,757
Please thank your boss for me.

197
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:46,877
Yes ma'am.

198
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:49,837
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

199
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:52,998
Boy, say hi to your teacher.

200
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:54,397
Hi, teacher.

201
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:57,277
If that is all, I'll go now.

202
00:16:57,438 --> 00:16:59,397
- Sure, headmaster.
- Goodbye.

203
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:16,197
Hey, rookie! Come here.

204
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,237
- What's your name? Where are you from?
- I'm Tui, sir.

205
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:25,037
If you want to be in this business,
you must have a lion's heart...

206
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:28,157
and you have to respect seniority.

207
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,357
That man, he's Chief Tong.

208
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,717
That one is Aad Fapah.

209
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,518
That one is Sergeant Dej.

210
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:37,597
And Madame Kimju.

211
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:40,437
They're the Big Four.

212
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:42,197
And that one...

213
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:45,277
is O-Tee,
the Chief's right-hand man.

214
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:49,437
Hello. Hello.

215
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:54,877
- Hello, Boss.
- Hello.

216
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,117
- Big Boss has been expecting you.
- Right.

217
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,119
This is the film director
who wants to cast Ploy.

218
00:18:01,198 --> 00:18:02,917
Hello.

219
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:05,437
This is my nephew Tui.
He's just started working for us.

220
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:07,717
- Hello, Boss.
- Hi.

221
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,318
Go talk to the director.
I'll go see Big Boss.

222
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:14,357
- Thanks, Boss.
- No problem.

223
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:16,477
Hello, everyone.

224
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:18,677
Hold on!

225
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,277
Light this for me.

226
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,557
I quit smoking.

227
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:28,437
Your boss doesn't have a light.
Why don't you pricks get him one?

228
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:30,557
How did you train your men, huh?

229
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:39,757
Excuse me,
Big Boss is expecting me.

230
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:02,317
Big Boss,
this is Daeng and his friends.

231
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:05,477
For men like us,

232
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:08,917
the word "gangsters"
is more meaningful than people think.

233
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:11,637
It doesn't matter how many
people we manage to beat up,

234
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:14,597
people still call us
"hooligans" or "thugs."

235
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:19,557
But to me, gangsters and thugs
are two different species.

236
00:19:20,518 --> 00:19:25,117
For us, to be a gangster
means you're a part of...

237
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:26,717
a family.

238
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:44,865
Right, I'll draw the number now.

239
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:52,277
Number 10!

240
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:56,917
Shit, the house always wins!

241
00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:59,157
Are you screwing me?
I'm not paying!

242
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:05,957
Hey!

243
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:09,397
You lose, you pay up.

244
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:15,197
Daeng, you think you can
boss me around?

245
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:20,877
Let's go!

246
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:25,877
- Forget it.
- Cheaters!

247
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:28,317
The brothers always told me

248
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,117
that a gangster's worth is his courage.

249
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:35,797
That's why Jod has pledged
his life on Daeng Bireley,

250
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,837
even though Jod was
more senior in years and experience.

251
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:53,797
Hey, that looks kinda fun.

252
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:57,477
Dam, look there.

253
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:37,877
Running away, Jod?

254
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:02,797
Stop!

255
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,197
I don't know
why you guys helped me.

256
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:43,556
Thank you anyway.

257
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:49,876
I'm Jod.

258
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:55,677
What the?

259
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:34,436
Just as Laem Singh had predicted:

260
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:36,916
Pu was a mad dog.

261
00:23:37,078 --> 00:23:41,436
He gritted his teeth and waited for the
time when he could challenge Daeng.

262
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:47,677
Then one day, every newspaper branded
him with a formidable nickname...

263
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:51,036
Pu the Molotov Cocktail.

264
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:57,196
In that gang, there was
Pu the Molotov Cocktail,

265
00:23:57,357 --> 00:23:59,637
there were Dam Esso and Jod.

266
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:03,557
But Pu was a real slimebag,
especially with women.

267
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:07,317
He'd lick his lips every time
he saw schoolgirls walk by,

268
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:10,116
waiting to pounce on them like a wolf.

269
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,037
He was in the news every day.

270
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:18,196
I used to deliver newspapers,
and Pu was always on the front page.

271
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:19,917
Almost every day.

272
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:21,076
Watch me.

273
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:23,396
We're leaving now!

274
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:25,957
Hello, darling,
would you like to join Pu for a ride?

275
00:24:26,118 --> 00:24:28,196
Pu? Which Pu?

276
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:33,556
Oh right, I used to meet them
near the cinema.

277
00:24:33,717 --> 00:24:35,797
You're Daeng's lackey, aren't you?

278
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,516
Shut up!
Who told you I'm his lackey?

279
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:40,156
Let's go now.

280
00:24:41,117 --> 00:24:44,157
Let me bang you once
and you'll thank me for it.

281
00:24:46,597 --> 00:24:47,956
Bitch!

282
00:24:53,717 --> 00:24:55,117
It was an accident,

283
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,357
but it made Pu the Molotov Cocktail
an overnight sensation.

284
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:03,036
Then he decided
to challenge Daeng.

285
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:27,196
Take it off!

286
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:31,397
Take it off!

287
00:25:31,557 --> 00:25:34,156
Please let me go!
I'm Daeng's brother, you know that?

288
00:25:34,317 --> 00:25:35,797
Daeng's brother?

289
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:40,317
Get it in your skull...
this is my territory!

290
00:25:40,477 --> 00:25:42,436
If Daeng's little brothers
mess around here again,

291
00:25:42,598 --> 00:25:45,276
- I'll kick the shit out of you!
- Fuck off!

292
00:25:46,998 --> 00:25:49,396
Tell Daeng it's me who beat you up!

293
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:52,117
Give me a smoke.

294
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:52,732
Give me a smoke.

295
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:05,637
- Lor...
- Yes, chief.

296
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,356
- I envy you.
- Why's that?

297
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:10,037
You've trained your boys well.

298
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:12,757
- Look at this walking dynamite. Pu!
- Sir.

299
00:26:12,918 --> 00:26:15,476
- You're famous now.
- Thanks, chief.

300
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,996
But Boss Lor will make
Daeng his lieutenant anyway.

301
00:26:20,157 --> 00:26:21,277
Is that right?

302
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:25,557
My boys are like brothers.

303
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,597
No one is rising above anyone's head.

304
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:32,756
Lor, you should be a politician!

305
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,636
A gangster won't stab
someone in the back.

306
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:37,637
Pu...

307
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:41,796
if you want to work for me,
let me know.

308
00:27:05,718 --> 00:27:10,677
Let it rest,
Chief Tong is Big Boss' stepson.

309
00:27:12,557 --> 00:27:13,876
It's all right.

310
00:27:14,037 --> 00:27:18,477
I respect the chief
like my own brother.

311
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:21,436
You don't have to worry.

312
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:22,796
Mm-hmm.

313
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:40,196
I want to become a monk.

314
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:44,596
I'm here to see what I can do.

315
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:48,716
Thanks, pal.

316
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:52,117
Have you heard?

317
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:57,317
He wanted to piss you off.

318
00:27:58,597 --> 00:27:59,596
If you don't do something,

319
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,093
no one will take
Daeng Bireley seriously.

320
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:06,757
And if you want to be a monk,
it's going to be hell out there.

321
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:10,597
It's all right.

322
00:28:11,718 --> 00:28:13,276
Just do what you want.

323
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:17,717
I'm happy for you.

324
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:21,396
I want you to find peace.

325
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:24,396
About Pu...
I'll take care of him.

326
00:28:26,157 --> 00:28:27,757
Thanks again.

327
00:28:29,717 --> 00:28:33,996
In my life
I've done a lot of bad things.

328
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,316
What I really want to do now

329
00:28:38,277 --> 00:28:39,756
is to become a monk
for my mother.

330
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:43,397
And you, Jod?

331
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,556
I want my mom
and my sister to live well.

332
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:50,876
That's your mom and sister.

333
00:28:52,237 --> 00:28:53,557
I'm asking about you.

334
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:57,357
America.

335
00:28:58,318 --> 00:28:59,396
What?

336
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:04,196
I've heard about people
who've immigrated to America.

337
00:29:05,198 --> 00:29:07,957
They send back tons of money.

338
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:12,916
And maybe I'll bump
into James Dean or Elvis.

339
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:19,157
If you do, don't forget
to tell them about our adventures.

340
00:29:29,237 --> 00:29:30,277
Daeng?

341
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:36,516
There's only one thing
I want to ask you.

342
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:39,996
If something happens...

343
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:43,597
please take care
of my mother and sister.

344
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:03,716
Hi.

345
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,396
An invitation
to Brother Daeng's ordination.

346
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:07,916
Please join us, both of you.

347
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:11,317
Sorry, my wife and I have
to go out of town.

348
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:15,516
- Please join us at the ceremony.
- Sorry, I really can't.

349
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:17,436
- Really?
- I'm so sorry.

350
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:19,356
All right.

351
00:30:22,877 --> 00:30:25,516
You're not being helpful at all!

352
00:30:27,317 --> 00:30:28,356
Thong...

353
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:31,356
I think something's not right.

354
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:34,556
Nobody wants to go
to the ceremony.

355
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:37,836
Look...

356
00:30:37,997 --> 00:30:41,156
I think Pu has sent his boys
to warn the people here

357
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:43,636
not to go
to Brother Daeng's ordination.

358
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,316
Well, so this means...

359
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,996
if anybody shows up,

360
00:30:48,157 --> 00:30:49,957
they're taking Daeng's side.

361
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:52,636
That's exactly why I'm not
running around like you!

362
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:55,636
So which side will you choose?

363
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:58,236
I don't know.

364
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,316
You?

365
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:04,756
I'll choose the winning side.

366
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:08,917
But I think this is
really not our business.

367
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:11,637
You're making me confused!

368
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,716
Let's go!
Lots of envelopes to give out.

369
00:31:14,877 --> 00:31:17,557
- Come on!
- Go!

370
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:19,116
Hurry up!

371
00:31:32,477 --> 00:31:34,636
Will you go
to Brother Daeng's ceremony?

372
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:40,636
Go back and tell your Brother Daeng
this is Pu's territory!

373
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:45,276
Only idiots will want to watch
Daeng become a fuckin' monk!

374
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:50,276
Whoo-hoo!

375
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,117
DAENG BIRELEY'S
ORDINATION CEREMONY

376
00:32:04,277 --> 00:32:07,236
Eat up, boys!
It's Brother Pu's treat!

377
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:11,317
And he's not coming?

378
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:13,396
I don't know.

379
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,276
It's okay. We can start.

380
00:32:29,757 --> 00:32:30,756
This one?

381
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,636
Yes, and that one too.

382
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:43,596
Is this yours?

383
00:32:47,837 --> 00:32:48,796
Eat it.

384
00:32:49,757 --> 00:32:51,316
Stuff this shit in your mouth.

385
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:56,276
I don't know what
you're talking about.

386
00:32:56,438 --> 00:33:00,277
Jod! This is Pu's territory!

387
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,036
You cocky piece of shit!

388
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:33,996
Eat it!

389
00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:06,396
Let me help.

390
00:34:07,357 --> 00:34:08,356
It's okay, Mom.

391
00:34:08,517 --> 00:34:10,596
Now, let me.

392
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,316
Don't act like a little boy.

393
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:52,396
Walapa!

394
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:08,196
It kicks pretty hard,

395
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,876
but the aim is perfect.

396
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:15,676
I put it together myself.

397
00:35:16,637 --> 00:35:17,996
It looks fine.

398
00:35:27,797 --> 00:35:29,076
Thanks.

399
00:36:15,157 --> 00:36:16,276
Hey, Pu!

400
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:53,156
They say Jod was the first man
who killed with a gun.

401
00:36:53,317 --> 00:36:57,236
That shot marked a shift
from the age of knives

402
00:36:57,397 --> 00:36:59,716
to the age of guns.

403
00:37:19,477 --> 00:37:22,036
I'd like to say

404
00:37:22,197 --> 00:37:24,916
that today I am speaking to you

405
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:29,236
with tears in my eyes.

406
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:43,676
Then there was a coup d'etat.

407
00:37:43,837 --> 00:37:47,676
The military government cracked down
on gangsters and triads

408
00:37:47,837 --> 00:37:50,276
and threw them all in jail.

409
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:53,635
Field Marshall Sarit famously
said that as prime minister

410
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:55,835
he would take
all responsibilities for using

411
00:37:55,997 --> 00:37:59,196
the iron rule of Article 17.

412
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:01,396
Daeng and his gang faded out.

413
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:04,436
They didn't go around
wreaking havoc as much.

414
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:07,916
That was the end
of the rock 'n' roll gangsters.

415
00:38:10,516 --> 00:38:13,276
Boss Lor expanded his business

416
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:15,956
to contraband smuggling
in the south.

417
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:19,636
He asked Brother Daeng
to look after it.

418
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,676
Daeng was certain that he could get
rich there and quit the gang life.

419
00:38:37,557 --> 00:38:40,716
But Brother Daeng
left us unexpectedly.

420
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:44,235
The death of the notorious hoodlum
made headlines for a few days.

421
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:45,516
Then he was forgotten...

422
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:22,795
Why did you kill me?
What did I do to you?

423
00:39:28,276 --> 00:39:29,396
I'm sorry.

424
00:39:32,157 --> 00:39:33,996
I didn't mean to.

425
00:39:57,076 --> 00:40:02,155
4 YEARS LATER

426
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:04,836
Piak!

427
00:40:04,997 --> 00:40:06,316
Got the stuff?

428
00:40:09,836 --> 00:40:11,676
Sure, wait here.

429
00:40:23,597 --> 00:40:24,596
Thong!

430
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:26,356
Someone wants the stuff.

431
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:27,915
Over there, get it.

432
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:29,636
Stop it!

433
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:37,236
Finish it!
I need you downstairs.

434
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,595
Hey, stop painting now.

435
00:40:39,757 --> 00:40:43,035
Take a shower.
I'll take you somewhere cool.

436
00:40:43,197 --> 00:40:46,556
Get out now! Go!

437
00:40:46,716 --> 00:40:48,915
Place your bet!

438
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:52,635
Now!

439
00:40:53,596 --> 00:40:55,355
No more bets!

440
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:57,756
Hup!

441
00:40:59,397 --> 00:41:02,235
All right!

442
00:41:03,557 --> 00:41:05,836
- Bet now!
- Drawing now!

443
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:07,155
You want to bet?

444
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:10,875
Number six!

445
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:14,356
Yes!

446
00:41:14,517 --> 00:41:17,035
Cash it at the table.

447
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:23,875
Give it to me.

448
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:28,756
Good.

449
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,795
Keep this.

450
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:34,435
Thank you!

451
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:37,796
Let's go.

452
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,156
MODERN AMERICAN FASHION

453
00:41:44,316 --> 00:41:46,196
This tailor is cool.

454
00:41:46,357 --> 00:41:49,275
Trust me.

455
00:42:12,277 --> 00:42:15,035
Son of a bitch!
What's your problem, huh?

456
00:42:15,196 --> 00:42:16,476
Do you want some?

457
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:18,236
What the fuck are you looking at?

458
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:27,246
I think we're doing fine
peddling the stuff.

459
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:31,115
We should stop ripping off the boss.

460
00:42:31,277 --> 00:42:32,396
It's risky.

461
00:42:33,357 --> 00:42:36,116
Since the cops started cracking down,

462
00:42:36,277 --> 00:42:38,755
this area is as quiet as a graveyard.

463
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:42,956
That means you and I are
the coolest guys around, right?

464
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:45,475
- Hey.
- Shit!

465
00:42:46,436 --> 00:42:48,716
Are you scared?

466
00:42:48,877 --> 00:42:50,555
Where did you get the gun?

467
00:42:50,716 --> 00:42:53,435
In our line of work, we have to keep up
with new developments.

468
00:42:53,596 --> 00:42:57,555
Watch me. I'll shoot
the first guy who shows up.

469
00:42:57,716 --> 00:43:00,236
Are you talkin' to me? Huh?

470
00:43:04,676 --> 00:43:07,835
Hey, are you two with a gang?

471
00:43:07,996 --> 00:43:11,916
- No, we're just...
- I didn't ask you. Frisk them.

472
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,755
Anything on them?

473
00:43:19,317 --> 00:43:20,436
Are you old enough to smoke?

474
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:21,796
- Are they clean?
- Yes sir.

475
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:27,236
You two, don't let me catch you.

476
00:43:37,876 --> 00:43:41,475
The anti-gangster law forbids people
to hang around on a bridge.

477
00:43:41,637 --> 00:43:42,955
I used to do that.

478
00:43:43,116 --> 00:43:45,150
I just rushed back home
every time I saw a police car.

479
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:49,435
It's impossible.
You can't beat the cops.

480
00:43:56,477 --> 00:43:59,596
Big Boss,
the police want a bigger cut.

481
00:43:59,757 --> 00:44:03,476
If it goes on like this,
soon they'll squeeze us dry.

482
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:10,795
Everything is moving
so fast these days.

483
00:44:10,956 --> 00:44:15,315
The police are now running

484
00:44:15,476 --> 00:44:19,076
protection rackets themselves.

485
00:44:19,237 --> 00:44:24,555
We're no better
than errand boys to them.

486
00:44:27,236 --> 00:44:32,436
Everywhere we go,
there are cops and more cops.

487
00:44:33,956 --> 00:44:35,875
What's the difference?

488
00:44:37,637 --> 00:44:42,875
How can we become a warrior
without killing a crook?

489
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:10,516
Let's eat.

490
00:45:28,156 --> 00:45:31,916
In those days,
thugs didn't get to stand in court.

491
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:34,435
Where the hell is that S.O.B. Hiding?

492
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:39,636
Enough, enough already, I'll tell you.

493
00:45:48,596 --> 00:45:51,075
Brother Jod,
do you remember me?

494
00:45:51,236 --> 00:45:52,916
I'm Thong,
and this is my pal...

495
00:45:53,077 --> 00:45:55,035
I'm Piak, sir.

496
00:45:55,196 --> 00:45:57,755
Boss Lor told us to pick you up.

497
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,595
And to serve you.

498
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,955
Thank you.

499
00:46:12,316 --> 00:46:14,515
Laem, who's that?

500
00:46:17,796 --> 00:46:20,955
Captain Kamnueng...
a pain in the ass.

501
00:46:21,116 --> 00:46:23,955
He was behind
the major crackdown.

502
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:26,315
He sniffs us out
like a bloodhound.

503
00:46:27,836 --> 00:46:29,435
What does he want now?

504
00:46:29,596 --> 00:46:34,515
He's a hunting dog,
and he won't quit easily.

505
00:46:38,156 --> 00:46:39,396
Stop the car.

506
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,155
Captain.

507
00:47:06,796 --> 00:47:08,875
Am I in trouble?

508
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:14,715
You will be.

509
00:47:15,716 --> 00:47:17,195
Just don't make a mistake.

510
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:38,875
You and Brother Daeng
are our role models!

511
00:47:41,436 --> 00:47:43,476
Why do you want
to be gangsters so bad?

512
00:47:44,437 --> 00:47:47,316
Of course,
we want to be like you!

513
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:49,076
People bow at you wherever you go.

514
00:47:49,237 --> 00:47:51,355
And you always get the girls!

515
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:56,595
My friend is crazy.
Don't pay attention to him.

516
00:47:56,757 --> 00:47:58,475
Damn it, you know it's true.

517
00:47:59,436 --> 00:48:01,716
Would you like to eat
anything in particular?

518
00:48:04,796 --> 00:48:06,715
Fried fish and omelet.

519
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:30,115
Food is ready now.

520
00:48:32,236 --> 00:48:33,236
Thank you.

521
00:48:58,116 --> 00:49:02,155
Captain, please have
some sympathy.

522
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:03,955
Please don't come here again.

523
00:49:05,236 --> 00:49:08,916
I haven't a clue where Jod is.

524
00:49:09,877 --> 00:49:13,075
After he got out of jail,
he never came here.

525
00:49:14,036 --> 00:49:14,995
Hmm.

526
00:49:18,316 --> 00:49:21,355
I believe you that your son
never contacted you.

527
00:49:22,316 --> 00:49:23,755
So please leave.

528
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:34,075
Hmm.

529
00:49:36,716 --> 00:49:40,036
What about your daughter?
Has he contacted her?

530
00:49:40,196 --> 00:49:43,315
I've heard that Jod is
very close to his sister.

531
00:49:43,477 --> 00:49:46,356
Maybe they've already
met somewhere.

532
00:49:49,436 --> 00:49:51,595
My daughter has moved
to her husband's.

533
00:49:53,196 --> 00:49:55,035
I'm worried about Jod.

534
00:49:58,396 --> 00:50:01,915
He's a good boy.
Please don't hurt him.

535
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:11,355
Ma'am, listen to me carefully.
Hmm.

536
00:50:11,516 --> 00:50:18,235
I'll give you some time to think it over
before you answer me.

537
00:50:26,677 --> 00:50:30,115
I'll give you until
this butterfly drops dead.

538
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:31,635
Is that enough?

539
00:50:36,996 --> 00:50:37,955
Mmm!

540
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:40,395
And I forgot to tell you...

541
00:50:40,556 --> 00:50:44,155
my men have been watching
this neighborhood.

542
00:50:44,316 --> 00:50:48,795
They reported that your daughter
spent the night here.

543
00:50:48,956 --> 00:50:54,355
Jod too. After he got out,
he came back to live here.

544
00:50:54,517 --> 00:50:58,435
He just left this morning,
am I right?

545
00:51:02,196 --> 00:51:05,515
Enough!
You have no right to do this!

546
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:09,035
My brother did his time!
What more do you want?

547
00:51:09,996 --> 00:51:13,115
Get out of my house now!

548
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:16,475
My brother is clean now!
You can't do this to us!

549
00:51:17,436 --> 00:51:18,516
Mom!

550
00:51:32,076 --> 00:51:35,035
Since Big Boss died

551
00:51:35,196 --> 00:51:37,915
Boss Lor has been trying
to take his place.

552
00:51:38,076 --> 00:51:40,315
But other gangs will want
to challenge him,

553
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:42,835
and Boss Lor needs good men
to help him fight.

554
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:48,155
I'm willing to bet that
he'll call on your brother.

555
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:55,035
Listen, I will never allow
this vicious cycle to repeat itself

556
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:58,835
as long as my unit is responsible
for stability and peace.

557
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,515
All right.

558
00:52:02,676 --> 00:52:05,595
Please tell Jod...

559
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:10,235
that I'm always prepared
to drag him back to jail.

560
00:52:12,436 --> 00:52:14,715
Thank you, and goodbye.

561
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,595
Smile, Boss.

562
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:41,355
That's nice.

563
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:43,355
Thank you, Tui.

564
00:52:43,516 --> 00:52:45,515
Take her to see the hippo.

565
00:52:45,676 --> 00:52:49,675
It's hot as hell.
This will help cool you down.

566
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:50,795
Thanks, Boss.

567
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:54,435
Since you've returned,

568
00:52:54,596 --> 00:52:56,755
I can sleep more peacefully.

569
00:52:58,036 --> 00:53:01,075
Can you let bygones be bygones?

570
00:53:01,236 --> 00:53:03,715
I mean your conflict
with Pu the Molotov.

571
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:07,475
I'm cool,
but Pu won't want to stop.

572
00:53:07,636 --> 00:53:11,195
He has to! I'll talk to him.

573
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:14,155
Since Big Boss passed away,

574
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:18,555
those pricks gang up to block me
from taking his place.

575
00:53:20,316 --> 00:53:25,075
I'm always generous
to those assholes.

576
00:53:25,236 --> 00:53:29,635
But when it's my turn,
they're plotting against me!

577
00:53:31,996 --> 00:53:33,715
You have to help me.

578
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:35,755
Come here. Tui.

579
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:41,555
Take these men to help you.

580
00:53:42,516 --> 00:53:44,755
Jod, let me tell you...

581
00:53:45,716 --> 00:53:48,195
I've been through
the thick and thin of it.

582
00:53:48,356 --> 00:53:51,675
I've worked for big bosses
and small bosses.

583
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:54,275
What's important is your heart.

584
00:53:55,636 --> 00:53:57,995
You have a great heart,
you'll go far.

585
00:53:59,476 --> 00:54:01,595
But our work is dangerous.

586
00:54:01,756 --> 00:54:03,875
Besides your heart,
you need something else.

587
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:10,075
Here, the Buddha amulet
from the Black Monk.

588
00:54:10,235 --> 00:54:12,075
- Do you have it?
- No.

589
00:54:13,076 --> 00:54:14,875
You're quite something.

590
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:17,835
Tui, don't interrupt me, please.

591
00:54:17,996 --> 00:54:19,955
Or I'll stop the car
and shoot you dead!

592
00:54:20,996 --> 00:54:22,515
Come on, don't be angry.

593
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,115
You shoot, I'll shoot.
I have a piece too!

594
00:54:25,276 --> 00:54:26,915
I also have an amulet I bought from you.

595
00:54:27,076 --> 00:54:28,555
I'm driving here, brat!

596
00:54:28,716 --> 00:54:30,675
You have black magic,
I have it too!

597
00:54:30,836 --> 00:54:33,195
What are you talking about?

598
00:54:33,356 --> 00:54:35,675
So you don't know?

599
00:54:35,836 --> 00:54:39,795
Uncle Ham makes money
by selling amulets to new recruits.

600
00:54:40,756 --> 00:54:43,875
Sometimes they're real,
sometimes not, but mostly not!

601
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:46,675
Cut it, dumbass!

602
00:54:46,836 --> 00:54:48,715
Why do I have you in my watch?

603
00:54:48,876 --> 00:54:50,395
And why do
I have you as my boss?

604
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:51,835
You're driving me nuts.

605
00:54:52,836 --> 00:54:55,354
Don't listen to him.

606
00:54:55,516 --> 00:54:57,555
Anyway, will you buy one?

607
00:54:57,716 --> 00:55:00,355
- Come on.
- I'll give you a discount.

608
00:55:00,516 --> 00:55:04,155
Tell him about the time you put
the amulet in your mouth and you choked.

609
00:55:06,356 --> 00:55:08,275
Shut up, asshole!

610
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:11,394
Jod, it's all right.

611
00:55:11,556 --> 00:55:14,515
If you don't want it,
I won't force you.

612
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:18,555
By the way,
can you tell me something?

613
00:55:20,836 --> 00:55:22,555
You shot Pu.

614
00:55:23,556 --> 00:55:26,354
Do you think he'll come
to work for Boss Lor?

615
00:56:51,235 --> 00:56:52,675
Why did you shoot me?!

616
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:22,315
Brother Jod...

617
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:24,395
can I have a cigarette?

618
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:40,795
Brother Jod...

619
00:57:43,596 --> 00:57:44,754
Brother Jod...

620
00:57:46,515 --> 00:57:47,835
I'm nervous.

621
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:51,194
Tomorrow I'll go
on rounds with you.

622
00:57:52,155 --> 00:57:54,074
I still don't know how to do it.

623
00:57:57,755 --> 00:57:59,075
Don't be scared.

624
00:58:00,635 --> 00:58:04,675
I want your advice.

625
00:58:05,756 --> 00:58:07,835
I want to have no fear, like you.

626
00:58:10,596 --> 00:58:12,154
Do you think I'm not scared?

627
00:58:14,556 --> 00:58:16,434
What is there to be scared of?

628
00:58:20,115 --> 00:58:21,315
I'm scared of lizards.

629
00:58:22,276 --> 00:58:24,955
- What?
- I'm scared of lizards.

630
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:28,795
If you tell anyone, you're dead.

631
00:58:33,155 --> 00:58:34,435
I just thought...

632
00:58:35,915 --> 00:58:38,794
that someone who's killed
dozens of people

633
00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:41,914
has nothing left to be scared of.

634
00:58:43,835 --> 00:58:45,155
I am scared.

635
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:50,034
Because I remember
every single face of those people.

636
00:58:53,956 --> 00:58:55,675
I'll never forget them.

637
00:59:09,156 --> 00:59:11,035
Amen.

638
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:25,834
I'd never cheat your boss,
but you see how bad I'm doing.

639
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:28,714
Life is hard, man! I don't even have
enough to feed my children!

640
00:59:28,876 --> 00:59:30,194
You spent it all on gambling.

641
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:34,515
I'm a gambler.

642
00:59:34,676 --> 00:59:36,394
What else can I do?

643
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,515
Jod...

644
00:59:42,675 --> 00:59:45,434
please, help me just once.
I'll bow at your feet.

645
00:59:47,156 --> 00:59:49,834
Take this money and get
some food for your children.

646
01:00:03,275 --> 01:00:04,275
That's it then.

647
01:00:05,236 --> 01:00:08,395
You pay the rest in installments.

648
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:11,275
I'll talk to Boss Lor.

649
01:00:11,436 --> 01:00:14,155
Thank you so much, Jod.

650
01:00:25,156 --> 01:00:27,355
I don't get it.

651
01:00:27,515 --> 01:00:29,754
Why was Brother Jod
so soft on those people?

652
01:00:31,675 --> 01:00:33,954
Those cheap asses
want to cheat us!

653
01:00:35,195 --> 01:00:36,515
I'll tell you what I think...

654
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:40,434
I think Brother Jod is a wimp.

655
01:00:42,235 --> 01:00:44,195
Don't worry about him.

656
01:00:48,876 --> 01:00:52,595
Pu and Dam didn't die in jail
like Laem Singh said.

657
01:00:52,755 --> 01:00:56,474
As soon as they got out,
they took revenge on Laem Singh.

658
01:01:08,955 --> 01:01:10,675
And they would've sought revenge

659
01:01:10,836 --> 01:01:12,755
against Brother Jod and Daeng too,

660
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:15,755
had they not pointed their guns
at each other first.

661
01:01:22,476 --> 01:01:24,795
It was a fight over a prostitute.

662
01:01:25,756 --> 01:01:28,874
It was a disgraceful ending
to the notorious buddies Pu and Dam.

663
01:01:29,036 --> 01:01:33,114
Half of Pu's face was
blown off by Dam's shotgun.

664
01:01:34,116 --> 01:01:37,435
His corpse was
a disfigured mess,

665
01:01:37,595 --> 01:01:39,954
just like the girl
he killed at the bus stop.

666
01:01:46,395 --> 01:01:48,635
In the end they turned
against each other.

667
01:01:48,796 --> 01:01:51,395
They're hooligans, and their tempers
got the better of them.

668
01:01:51,556 --> 01:01:54,234
It was all because of a woman.

669
01:02:46,635 --> 01:02:49,794
You dropped your comb.

670
01:02:50,796 --> 01:02:52,275
I'll leave it right here.

671
01:03:36,196 --> 01:03:38,675
That was another great song!

672
01:03:47,475 --> 01:03:49,114
Boys, take a look at which girl

673
01:03:49,275 --> 01:03:51,395
you'd like to ask
for a dance next round!

674
01:03:52,355 --> 01:03:54,234
Boss Lor is here.

675
01:03:55,195 --> 01:03:56,554
Hello, Boss.

676
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:05,194
On behalf of everyone,
I'd like to ask Boss to say something

677
01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:08,394
to all of us for this
New Year celebration.

678
01:04:17,675 --> 01:04:19,795
For this new year,

679
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,794
I promise to look after
everyone like my own family.

680
01:04:22,956 --> 01:04:24,834
Happy New Year!

681
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:28,435
He's brought his wife tonight.

682
01:04:28,596 --> 01:04:30,515
That means
the little slut is available.

683
01:04:30,675 --> 01:04:33,274
Bring her to my car,

684
01:04:33,435 --> 01:04:36,474
but don't make a scene.

685
01:04:37,435 --> 01:04:39,194
We won't stop
until we're super-drunk!

686
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:41,114
Let's go wrap some gifts.

687
01:04:46,075 --> 01:04:47,674
Bring up the next song!

688
01:04:47,835 --> 01:04:51,635
Girls, give them your best service!

689
01:04:51,795 --> 01:04:56,435
Chief, don't hesitate
to give me your advice.

690
01:04:57,396 --> 01:05:00,194
Advice?
We're all grown-ups,

691
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:02,634
and everything here
already belongs to you.

692
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:08,954
What belongs to me,
belongs to you.

693
01:05:09,915 --> 01:05:13,474
No, I won't touch what's yours.

694
01:05:17,795 --> 01:05:20,074
I have to use the toilet.

695
01:05:25,315 --> 01:05:28,034
- Ah.
- Cheers!

696
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:33,315
Cheers, Jod.
Happy New Year!

697
01:05:40,635 --> 01:05:42,354
What the fuck are you doing?

698
01:05:44,995 --> 01:05:46,234
Piak!

699
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:52,594
Everything's under control!
Go on, dance!

700
01:05:52,755 --> 01:05:53,834
Uncle!

701
01:05:53,995 --> 01:05:55,834
What the fuck is this?

702
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:57,714
- He was going to rape your girl!
- And why did you shoot?

703
01:05:57,876 --> 01:05:59,674
The whole precinct will be here!

704
01:06:02,355 --> 01:06:03,794
I told you!

705
01:06:07,275 --> 01:06:10,154
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!

706
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:13,394
Boss! Stop!

707
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:19,395
Shh shh.

708
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:22,034
Good evening, Captain!

709
01:06:23,755 --> 01:06:27,234
It's such an honor
to have you in our house.

710
01:06:27,395 --> 01:06:29,474
It's really special!

711
01:06:29,635 --> 01:06:32,594
Captain, we're celebrating
the New Year.

712
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,355
What was that noise?

713
01:06:35,316 --> 01:06:37,514
What noise?

714
01:06:37,675 --> 01:06:41,075
We didn't hear anything, did we?
What noise?

715
01:06:42,395 --> 01:06:43,955
There was no noise!

716
01:06:45,675 --> 01:06:50,474
People told me that besides being
a tough cop, you're also a great singer.

717
01:06:50,635 --> 01:06:52,394
Would you sing us a song?

718
01:06:53,355 --> 01:06:55,914
We want to hear the captain sing, right?
Let's give him a big hand!

719
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:05,994
Boss...

720
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:08,994
he's Chief Tong's man.

721
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:13,674
Jod,

722
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:15,674
take care of this.

723
01:07:15,835 --> 01:07:24,874
I'm laughing at destiny

724
01:07:26,196 --> 01:07:34,754
I hold fate in contempt

725
01:07:34,915 --> 01:07:43,874
I challenge the sky and the earth!

726
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:52,954
I fear not them,
and I fear no man!

727
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,394
You sing like a pro, Captain.

728
01:08:03,235 --> 01:08:05,034
Happy New Year, sir.

729
01:08:07,555 --> 01:08:10,194
Congratulations
on your new position.

730
01:08:10,355 --> 01:08:11,874
Thank you.

731
01:08:12,035 --> 01:08:16,674
Just make sure you stay alive
until the next new year.

732
01:08:42,235 --> 01:08:43,954
Thank you.

733
01:09:39,795 --> 01:09:43,474
- Shit!
- I almost blew your brains out!

734
01:09:43,635 --> 01:09:44,874
Why the gun?

735
01:09:45,035 --> 01:09:46,474
I thought we were
just being a decoy!

736
01:09:47,435 --> 01:09:50,114
- I know that.
- There, Chief Tong is here.

737
01:09:50,275 --> 01:09:51,354
- He's here?
- Let's move!

738
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:52,954
- Go go!
- Hurry up!

739
01:10:24,395 --> 01:10:28,074
Uncle, how many people
have you killed?

740
01:10:31,915 --> 01:10:34,874
Haven't you heard
what they call me?

741
01:10:35,835 --> 01:10:37,434
"Ham the Mass Murderer."

742
01:10:39,395 --> 01:10:42,474
I mean, seriously.
How many?

743
01:10:46,595 --> 01:10:50,434
Four or five,
when I was a young man.

744
01:10:51,675 --> 01:10:54,674
Damn, I still remember their faces.

745
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:59,274
Then do you understand
why I want to talk to Chief Tong first?

746
01:11:02,195 --> 01:11:03,554
Jod...

747
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:06,593
how can you be in this job
without killing people?

748
01:11:09,754 --> 01:11:12,714
What's your problem?
Are you messing with me?

749
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,354
He's coming out.

750
01:12:18,955 --> 01:12:22,754
I want to talk to you nicely,
if you want to do the same.

751
01:12:22,915 --> 01:12:26,434
Talk? And what's
that supposed to mean?

752
01:12:37,355 --> 01:12:41,674
I'll give you a chance to run to
the road at the edge of the plantation.

753
01:12:41,835 --> 01:12:44,434
If you make it there alive,
you are free to go.

754
01:12:44,595 --> 01:12:47,273
But don't ever come back.

755
01:12:50,834 --> 01:12:55,154
You know if I get out of here alive,
I'll definitely come back.

756
01:12:55,315 --> 01:12:56,434
So why are you doing this?

757
01:12:58,355 --> 01:13:00,514
If that day comes, we'll fight again.

758
01:13:00,675 --> 01:13:03,754
I'll start after you pick up the gun.

759
01:13:06,035 --> 01:13:06,994
Please begin.

760
01:13:13,675 --> 01:13:17,554
Lor is lucky
to have someone like you.

761
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:34,834
Thong!

762
01:14:34,394 --> 01:14:37,474
That's O-Tee.
What's he doing here?

763
01:14:48,794 --> 01:14:49,753
O-Tee!

764
01:14:55,595 --> 01:14:57,354
Hello, my friends.

765
01:14:57,515 --> 01:15:00,514
Boss Lor asked me to close the job
in case you guys missed it.

766
01:15:00,675 --> 01:15:03,313
And I want to say goodbye
to my old boss too.

767
01:15:38,755 --> 01:15:41,554
"What... what is..."

768
01:15:41,714 --> 01:15:44,033
Rub it hard and the genie
may come out!

769
01:15:44,194 --> 01:15:46,233
"What is this?

770
01:15:46,394 --> 01:15:49,513
Lt... it's a..."

771
01:15:49,674 --> 01:15:51,914
- Jod. Jod!
- "It's a cap."

772
01:15:52,075 --> 01:15:53,994
Tell me, was your father
an American GI?

773
01:15:54,155 --> 01:15:55,153
"A cap."

774
01:15:56,915 --> 01:15:57,874
I'm not sure.

775
01:15:59,075 --> 01:16:01,394
But my father's called... Terry.

776
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,594
- Terry?
- Yes, Terry.

777
01:16:05,635 --> 01:16:08,154
"What is this?"

778
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:11,314
"What... what is..."

779
01:16:11,474 --> 01:16:12,634
Look at those love birds.

780
01:16:12,795 --> 01:16:15,873
"A ball. A ball. A ba..."

781
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:24,714
What? He's mad
'cause I teased him about the genie?

782
01:16:29,754 --> 01:16:30,914
Are you sure, Piak?

783
01:16:34,355 --> 01:16:36,553
I'll take this one out.

784
01:16:36,714 --> 01:16:40,114
Then this, this and this.
A triple!

785
01:16:40,274 --> 01:16:42,994
Next you'll move like this.

786
01:16:44,595 --> 01:16:45,994
And game over.

787
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,674
That's great... you play
both your moves and my moves.

788
01:16:53,555 --> 01:16:56,234
Ploy is a young grandmaster!

789
01:16:59,874 --> 01:17:03,154
Tomorrow I'll take you
to an underground checkers den.

790
01:17:03,314 --> 01:17:04,874
She'll score big.

791
01:17:06,115 --> 01:17:07,514
I'm not that good.

792
01:17:08,475 --> 01:17:11,033
So it means Piak is so dumb?

793
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,314
Right, Piak,
are you that dumb?

794
01:17:16,675 --> 01:17:17,753
No, I'm not.

795
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:24,153
Let's go for a ride.

796
01:17:25,794 --> 01:17:26,753
Let's go.

797
01:17:28,475 --> 01:17:29,714
Please excuse me.

798
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:46,513
Piak, let's talk.

799
01:17:47,474 --> 01:17:48,674
What's up?

800
01:17:50,195 --> 01:17:51,993
I have a proposal.

801
01:17:52,954 --> 01:17:55,753
I'll leave Brother Jod.
I'll go work for Brother O-Tee.

802
01:17:57,074 --> 01:18:00,994
Idiot! You and I are
doing fine here!

803
01:18:01,955 --> 01:18:04,034
Stop talking crap!

804
01:18:05,675 --> 01:18:09,193
You're just so pussy-drunk
you can't think straight!

805
01:18:09,355 --> 01:18:11,154
You know she's fucking Boss Lor!

806
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:13,673
Soon he'll dash your brains out!

807
01:18:17,715 --> 01:18:20,953
If you want to stick with Brother Jod
and those clowns,

808
01:18:22,074 --> 01:18:23,194
it's your problem!

809
01:18:24,554 --> 01:18:26,234
Is that all?

810
01:18:28,595 --> 01:18:32,233
Listen to me,
one day this tart will get you killed!

811
01:19:01,114 --> 01:19:03,193
Sir, if you assist me
with the contract at Bo Pluang,

812
01:19:03,354 --> 01:19:06,193
you can reserve yourself
a nice European car.

813
01:19:07,434 --> 01:19:10,913
Boss Lor,
you're making it too obvious.

814
01:19:11,075 --> 01:19:13,954
You know I have to choose
the best proposal.

815
01:19:15,314 --> 01:19:17,033
Maybe a Rolls-Royce?

816
01:19:17,194 --> 01:19:20,233
Of course, you can call
the dealer now.

817
01:19:20,395 --> 01:19:22,433
I'll take care of everything.

818
01:19:30,594 --> 01:19:33,314
About what you told me...
I've already told Boss.

819
01:19:34,275 --> 01:19:35,553
And what did he say?

820
01:19:36,514 --> 01:19:38,993
He said he'd smelled
something fishy for a while.

821
01:19:39,954 --> 01:19:42,153
There must be a mole among them.

822
01:19:44,634 --> 01:19:47,314
Boss will get rid
of the mole first,

823
01:19:47,474 --> 01:19:49,074
then he'll wipe out the rest later.

824
01:19:57,114 --> 01:20:00,233
Brother Jod, let's go find
some chicks behind the cinema.

825
01:20:00,394 --> 01:20:02,153
No. You go on.

826
01:20:02,314 --> 01:20:03,594
What a killjoy!

827
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:05,833
- Piak, coming?
- No.

828
01:20:05,994 --> 01:20:08,073
What?

829
01:20:08,234 --> 01:20:09,794
Uncle, come with me?

830
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,153
You brat!

831
01:20:13,394 --> 01:20:14,633
Stop it!

832
01:20:26,675 --> 01:20:31,034
Now can you answer me?

833
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,194
I've heard that

834
01:20:34,355 --> 01:20:37,074
other bosses have
ganged up against Boss Lor.

835
01:20:37,235 --> 01:20:41,233
So he's recruited top killers to help.

836
01:20:42,194 --> 01:20:44,113
O-Tee is one of them.

837
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:47,673
It's war this time.

838
01:20:49,715 --> 01:20:54,074
That's what I call a good answer.

839
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:32,833
I've heard that
you collect butterflies,

840
01:21:32,994 --> 01:21:34,913
but their life-span is short.

841
01:21:35,074 --> 01:21:38,553
Today I'd like to give you
a turtle as a present.

842
01:21:38,714 --> 01:21:43,314
I want you to live long,
like turtles do.

843
01:21:43,475 --> 01:21:45,473
Please accept it.

844
01:21:50,554 --> 01:21:53,153
That's all you wanted...

845
01:21:55,314 --> 01:21:56,914
to see me about?

846
01:22:06,954 --> 01:22:08,673
That's all, Captain.

847
01:22:11,834 --> 01:22:17,074
Lucky that Jod helped talk
to Boss Lor for me,

848
01:22:17,234 --> 01:22:18,793
or I'd be in big trouble.

849
01:22:58,714 --> 01:23:00,153
Leave us.

850
01:23:04,714 --> 01:23:06,153
Talk.

851
01:23:07,114 --> 01:23:08,113
Well...

852
01:23:08,274 --> 01:23:12,713
Boss Lor has snatched
O-Tee from Chief Tong.

853
01:23:14,354 --> 01:23:17,593
Now that Chief Tong is gone,

854
01:23:17,754 --> 01:23:21,473
Boss Lor's moved in
to take over all his drug trade.

855
01:23:23,194 --> 01:23:24,873
Ploy is doing her best.

856
01:23:25,954 --> 01:23:27,353
Boss Lor likes her so much.

857
01:23:28,434 --> 01:23:33,473
Soon she'll find out
about his big shipment.

858
01:23:34,994 --> 01:23:38,793
Are you meeting with her today?

859
01:23:40,634 --> 01:23:42,473
It won't be serious.

860
01:23:49,354 --> 01:23:50,553
Captain...

861
01:23:51,514 --> 01:23:54,593
I think you should pull her
out of the operation.

862
01:23:58,114 --> 01:24:00,474
I think she is... too young.

863
01:24:00,634 --> 01:24:01,913
Listen.

864
01:24:03,074 --> 01:24:06,713
I'm a man of my word.

865
01:24:08,114 --> 01:24:11,314
I told her I'd meet her, and I will.

866
01:24:15,274 --> 01:24:17,074
Just like you.

867
01:24:17,234 --> 01:24:19,873
If you prove yourself useful
to the department,

868
01:24:20,034 --> 01:24:22,633
I promise I'll clean up your records

869
01:24:22,794 --> 01:24:28,233
after we've gotten rid
of Boss Lor and his gang.

870
01:24:30,834 --> 01:24:31,913
Thank you, sir.

871
01:24:55,274 --> 01:24:56,473
Piak.

872
01:25:00,474 --> 01:25:03,233
Do you want to be
a gangster all your life?

873
01:25:07,194 --> 01:25:08,393
No.

874
01:25:09,674 --> 01:25:11,753
I want a good life,
like everybody else.

875
01:25:11,914 --> 01:25:15,673
If I could,
I would quit right now.

876
01:25:17,954 --> 01:25:19,633
You can.

877
01:25:20,834 --> 01:25:24,593
I mean, we can get out
of this together.

878
01:25:28,314 --> 01:25:31,193
You're crazy.
Don't joke about that.

879
01:25:34,194 --> 01:25:35,793
I'm serious.

880
01:25:36,954 --> 01:25:41,833
I've brought you here because
I want you to meet someone

881
01:25:41,994 --> 01:25:44,953
who can help us get out of here.

882
01:26:51,674 --> 01:26:53,033
Captain!

883
01:26:53,994 --> 01:26:55,233
Captain!

884
01:27:00,994 --> 01:27:02,193
Ploy.

885
01:27:03,354 --> 01:27:05,632
Are you pulling my leg?

886
01:27:05,794 --> 01:27:07,633
There's no one here.

887
01:27:11,234 --> 01:27:13,953
Right, I was just joking.

888
01:27:17,954 --> 01:27:21,393
I just wanted to come here
to watch the sunset with you.

889
01:27:23,754 --> 01:27:27,313
But we have to go now.

890
01:27:45,394 --> 01:27:48,113
What I value above all

891
01:27:48,274 --> 01:27:51,393
from the people around me is trust.

892
01:27:52,354 --> 01:27:56,353
I love every one of you
like my friends...

893
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:59,833
like my brothers, my children...

894
01:27:59,994 --> 01:28:01,353
like my family.

895
01:28:02,634 --> 01:28:04,633
I'm a generous person.

896
01:28:04,794 --> 01:28:08,593
If you're good to me,
you'll be rewarded.

897
01:28:09,553 --> 01:28:12,832
But if you deceive me,
you'll be punished,

898
01:28:12,994 --> 01:28:16,672
especially those
who betray my trust!

899
01:28:30,714 --> 01:28:32,873
- Uncle Ham.
- Yes, Boss.

900
01:28:33,034 --> 01:28:36,313
You've been running the house
since Big Boss was here.

901
01:28:38,353 --> 01:28:43,073
Now tell me... who's the traitor?

902
01:28:45,634 --> 01:28:47,993
- No one, Boss.
- Hmm?

903
01:28:48,954 --> 01:28:50,433
I would've seen it.

904
01:28:51,394 --> 01:28:54,833
And I would be the one
who pulls the trigger.

905
01:28:55,794 --> 01:28:59,313
So you don't know that
this little shit is screwing my girl?

906
01:28:59,473 --> 01:29:01,633
Boss, I'm sorry!

907
01:29:01,793 --> 01:29:05,512
- I'm sorry!
- Boss, I'm sorry, please!

908
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:06,913
Get out!

909
01:29:07,074 --> 01:29:10,432
O-Tee, Jod, get rid of them!

910
01:29:10,593 --> 01:29:11,952
Boss!

911
01:29:12,994 --> 01:29:14,673
Boss, I'm sorry.

912
01:29:15,634 --> 01:29:20,312
Uncle, I'm sorry!
Brother Jod, I'm sorry!

913
01:29:20,474 --> 01:29:25,553
O-Tee, I'm sorry.

914
01:29:27,954 --> 01:29:30,993
Thong, Thong!

915
01:29:31,153 --> 01:29:33,633
Piak, why didn't you listen to me?

916
01:29:34,593 --> 01:29:36,753
- Please help me!
- Uncle!

917
01:29:39,274 --> 01:29:40,472
Uncle!

918
01:29:40,634 --> 01:29:42,913
Are you serious, Jod?

919
01:29:44,114 --> 01:29:46,193
Why are you doing this?

920
01:29:46,354 --> 01:29:48,432
We don't kill a member
of our family.

921
01:29:53,793 --> 01:29:55,073
Well said!

922
01:29:58,033 --> 01:29:59,793
You really are some piece of work.

923
01:30:00,913 --> 01:30:03,553
Let's hang out some time,
just the two of us.

924
01:30:03,714 --> 01:30:06,353
Stop it!

925
01:30:06,514 --> 01:30:08,393
I'll get rid of these two.

926
01:30:08,554 --> 01:30:10,393
No!

927
01:30:10,554 --> 01:30:12,152
- No! Ploy!
- Go!

928
01:30:12,313 --> 01:30:13,792
Ploy!

929
01:30:15,154 --> 01:30:16,873
Ploy!

930
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:21,273
Boss ordered me, not you!

931
01:30:21,434 --> 01:30:24,593
Wake up, Ploy!

932
01:30:24,754 --> 01:30:26,353
Wake up!

933
01:30:27,314 --> 01:30:29,233
Wake up, Ploy!

934
01:30:29,394 --> 01:30:31,632
This tart wasn't family, right?

935
01:30:34,034 --> 01:30:35,153
O-Tee.

936
01:30:47,994 --> 01:30:49,192
I'll get you soon.

937
01:30:52,554 --> 01:30:53,633
Thong, come.

938
01:31:06,193 --> 01:31:08,112
It was because of me!

939
01:31:09,674 --> 01:31:11,873
Uncle, Ploy died because of me!

940
01:31:15,953 --> 01:31:18,353
It was my fault, Brother Jod!

941
01:31:23,434 --> 01:31:27,192
It's not you, Piak.
It's me.

942
01:31:33,874 --> 01:31:35,193
Uncle...

943
01:31:36,154 --> 01:31:37,793
what do you mean?

944
01:31:44,753 --> 01:31:47,553
I... brought her here.

945
01:31:48,514 --> 01:31:49,753
I did.

946
01:32:07,274 --> 01:32:08,312
I gave up.

947
01:32:10,393 --> 01:32:13,952
I've been around for 30 years,
I know how all of this is going to end!

948
01:32:17,034 --> 01:32:19,312
I'm sick of shooting people.

949
01:32:44,513 --> 01:32:48,792
I'm the captain's informer.

950
01:32:51,194 --> 01:32:54,313
And I asked Ploy to do the same.

951
01:32:55,513 --> 01:32:58,512
Boss Lor knows.
I know he does.

952
01:33:17,554 --> 01:33:18,832
Jod...

953
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:21,473
now you know everything.

954
01:33:22,434 --> 01:33:23,512
Do what you have to do.

955
01:33:24,473 --> 01:33:26,792
Go on, I understand.

956
01:33:31,634 --> 01:33:33,433
You know I'm not going to do it.

957
01:33:35,754 --> 01:33:38,353
- But I will!
- Piak!

958
01:33:38,514 --> 01:33:40,433
How could you do this?

959
01:33:40,594 --> 01:33:42,952
How could you risk her life for you?!
How could you?

960
01:33:43,113 --> 01:33:45,032
Piak, you son of a bitch!

961
01:33:45,193 --> 01:33:47,232
I can't stand you any more!

962
01:33:47,394 --> 01:33:51,192
Are you completely daft?
Do you think you're the one who's hurt?

963
01:33:51,353 --> 01:33:53,952
Look at Uncle! Look!

964
01:33:54,114 --> 01:33:56,432
He's as upset as you are.

965
01:33:56,594 --> 01:34:00,193
Uncle, why don't you just tell him

966
01:34:00,353 --> 01:34:02,832
that Ploy was your daughter?

967
01:34:19,313 --> 01:34:22,312
I'd rather my girl be a mistress.

968
01:34:23,953 --> 01:34:25,153
Boss Lor's mistress...

969
01:34:26,753 --> 01:34:28,096
She was about to become an actress!

970
01:34:31,633 --> 01:34:33,272
That was better than being a whore!

971
01:34:35,674 --> 01:34:38,273
Do you know...

972
01:34:38,434 --> 01:34:40,913
what that asshole captain
promised me?

973
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:48,392
He promised me that
if I worked for him,

974
01:34:49,473 --> 01:34:53,793
Ploy and I would soon go back
to live a normal life.

975
01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:55,833
Like father and daughter!

976
01:35:04,114 --> 01:35:07,233
Do you realize what you've done?

977
01:35:07,394 --> 01:35:08,353
I do!

978
01:35:10,433 --> 01:35:12,313
And I don't want to die like a dog.

979
01:35:18,914 --> 01:35:20,592
I also know...

980
01:35:22,233 --> 01:35:24,072
that Boss Lor is planning
to get rid of us.

981
01:35:26,233 --> 01:35:28,353
If you don't jump ship now,

982
01:35:29,673 --> 01:35:31,152
you're finished!

983
01:35:34,633 --> 01:35:36,392
What will you do next?

984
01:35:40,753 --> 01:35:43,713
I started it, so I'll end it.

985
01:36:00,913 --> 01:36:01,953
Uncle!

986
01:37:06,193 --> 01:37:09,552
Boss is busy.
I've come on his behalf.

987
01:37:26,353 --> 01:37:28,152
Men like us
don't live long, right?

988
01:37:35,393 --> 01:37:36,593
Son of a bitch!

989
01:37:45,433 --> 01:37:48,432
O-Tee, go home.

990
01:37:48,593 --> 01:37:51,712
Tell Boss Lor I thank him
on Uncle's behalf.

991
01:38:13,234 --> 01:38:15,032
Thong, let's go.

992
01:38:23,953 --> 01:38:27,312
Make a choice, Piak...
which side are you on?

993
01:38:29,433 --> 01:38:31,236
I don't want to be the one
who has to shoot you.

994
01:38:45,153 --> 01:38:46,072
He's a man of honor.
He values dignity above all.

995
01:38:46,073 --> 01:38:49,952
He's a man of honor.
He values dignity above all.

996
01:38:50,114 --> 01:38:53,953
After that...
Jod just disappeared.

997
01:38:54,113 --> 01:38:58,992
I thought he got zapped.
No one heard of him again.

998
01:40:30,553 --> 01:40:31,512
Fall back!

999
01:42:12,473 --> 01:42:13,752
Tui!

1000
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:55,952
And you?
Which side will you choose?

1001
01:42:56,113 --> 01:42:58,912
I don't know. You?

1002
01:43:01,313 --> 01:43:02,425
I'll go for the winning side.

1003
01:43:55,593 --> 01:43:57,592
Let's do this like men.

1004
01:43:57,752 --> 01:43:59,032
As you wish.

1005
01:45:06,233 --> 01:45:07,592
Brother Jod!

1006
01:45:10,593 --> 01:45:11,592
Run!

1007
01:45:14,073 --> 01:45:15,231
Brother Jod!

1008
01:46:12,313 --> 01:46:14,272
No, I didn't hear anything about him.

1009
01:46:14,433 --> 01:46:16,271
I don't know where he went.

1010
01:46:16,433 --> 01:46:18,632
Rumor had it that Jod's father

1011
01:46:18,793 --> 01:46:21,672
took him back to the States

1012
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:24,792
or back home somewhere.
I really have no idea.

1013
01:46:24,953 --> 01:46:29,151
Insiders said he went to the States,

1014
01:46:29,312 --> 01:46:31,351
others said to Hong Kong.

1015
01:46:31,512 --> 01:46:34,752
But no one could confirm anything.

1016
01:46:34,912 --> 01:46:37,432
I don't know what happened next.

1017
01:46:39,273 --> 01:46:41,112
All I know is...

1018
01:46:41,273 --> 01:46:43,032
no matter what...

1019
01:46:43,193 --> 01:46:44,511
this man...

1020
01:46:45,472 --> 01:46:47,032
is the real thing.

1
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
We are standing in front of this building

2
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,120
awaiting talks between a Westerner
with capital from abroad

3
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,280
coming to do business with the Thai investor,
Chot Petchpantakarn.

4
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,720
There's nothing much going on at the moment.

5
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,080
- We are still waiting for him to arrive.
- This way, please.

6
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,400
Well, this is typical of a wealthy man like this.
He likes to come late.

7
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,600
Likes to se people wait. Those who can,
will wait for him, those who can't, will go home.

8
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
Copy that.

9
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,640
Now, we are in the grand ballroom
of a high-class hotel in the heart of the city.

10
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,280
It's the place where a contract will be signed
between the two powerful men,

11
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,080
completing a business deal between Mr Chot
Petchpantakarn and David's Group Public.

12
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
All done.

13
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,920
Get down!

14
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
For God's sake, get down!

15
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,200
Go!

16
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,680
Sir, get down!

17
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,680
Yes, we have an unknown number
of armed assailants.

18
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,520
The situation is getting worse.

19
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,400
Now, there's bloodshed,
but it's not known whose blood it is.

20
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,600
This blood doesn't belong to anybody.
It's mine.

21
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,800
That must mean I was shot.

22
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,520
- Hey, take Mr Chot away first. Now!
- Please come, sir.

23
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,560
Come on.

24
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,280
Sir, I'll count to three,
then you've got to run. OK?

25
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,840
One... two... three!

26
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,040
Sir!

27
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,280
The gun!

28
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,520
It's here!

29
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,880
- I know. Can you please pass it to me?
- Why didn't you tell me before?

30
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,720
Get up!

31
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,160
Get down!

32
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,920
- Sir, get up.
- If I die, it'll be because of you, not them.

33
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,200
Hey! Now they are outside.

34
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,280
Run!

35
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,440
- Quick!
- They are here now!

36
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,080
- Quick!
- Gentle, please.

37
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,680
Gentle... gentle.

38
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
It's going to be OK, sir.

39
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,640
Go. Now!

40
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,640
My goodness.
He must be going to die, definitely!

41
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,840
He has no choice.
I don't think he'll survive.

42
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,680
I think he will.

43
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,520
I can't see how he'll survive.

44
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,280
I think he will, definitely.

45
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,400
But I don't think so.

46
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,040
Yes, I don't think he will now.

47
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,200
He'll probably survive.

48
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,160
So what exactly is your opinion? OK. It's
up to you now to say whether he dies or not.

49
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,200
Right now I'm outside the hospital...

50
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,760
Chot Petchpantakarn is being treated,
following an assassination attempt

51
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,960
in the middle of signing a contract
with an important American businessman.

52
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,280
At the moment a team of doctors
is trying very hard to save his life.

53
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,000
Since this is a live report, we'll be keeping
you up to date with developments.

54
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,080
- Wongkom, where's my husband?
- In ICU.

55
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,400
- How is he?
- Book the temple for the funeral.

56
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,640
Chot!

57
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,520
Chai!

58
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,680
You have departed

59
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,360
From the family

60
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
Tony.

61
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,120
Tell him it's <i>my</i> father who died, not his.

62
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
Yes, boss.

63
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,800
Hello. Testing: one, two.

64
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,160
We would like to thank relatives and honourable
guests who have come to this funeral.

65
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,240
It was unexpected that Chot Petchpantakarn
should die so suddenly.

66
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,040
We would like to express our condolences.

67
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,120
He entered the business world
when he was 20 years old.

68
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,240
He worked extremely hard to become the best
in the business for four consecutive years.

69
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,200
He was the leader in the two industries:

70
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,240
two years in manufacturing
and another two in the software business.

71
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,840
To this day, no one has surpassed him.

72
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,400
His weight before he died
was 145 pounds.

73
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,600
He was 58 years old. He is survived by
Madam Chamchoi Petchpantakarn and his son,

74
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
whose name is Chaichol.

75
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,760
one house, 5,000 cows
and 100,000 chickens and ducks.

76
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,000
That was how he created
Petchpantakarn's Farm.

77
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,800
He has boosted Thailand's economy
and brought prosperity.

78
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,960
Round one!

79
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,360
May I ask the abbot
to preside over the funeral?

80
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,440
And may I ask the honourable guest Somchai
Khemtit to hold the funeral sacred cloth?

81
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,240
And may I call upon the vice president
of the Petchpantakarn Chemical Company?

82
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,040
Has it shattered? For that
you have to pay 500 baht for one injection.

CHANNEL 7 NEWS

84
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Madam.

85
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm so sorry that I couldn't help him.

86
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,360
I believe that you did the best.

87
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,040
Don't blame yourself, please.
It wasn't your fault.

88
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,000
Right. It was my father
who couldn't escape the bullets!

89
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,160
Chaichol, if he could have died for your father,
he would have done that.

90
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,080
Stop talking nonsense.

91
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,160
Hey! You turn up like an ugly ghost.
What's up?

92
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,840
Phakphoom, the lawyer,
would like to talk to you.

93
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,520
Thanks.

94
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Hello, Khun Phakphoom.

95
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,600
Right, yes. Yes. I can do it.
I'll bring him along.

96
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,280
Bye.

97
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,240
Uncle, what seems to be the problem?

98
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,680
Your father's will says that after the funeral
it should be read before the committee,

99
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,480
and we must make sure everyone is present.

100
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,520
We have to go now.
Please excuse me, my sister.

101
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Where are you going?

102
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,120
You'd better stay put.
I don't want to die like my father.

103
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,120
- Tony, arrange for the team to protect me.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,440
Back off! Back off!

105
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,960
I'd like to know who will control
the empire after him.

106
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,000
Kham-Sai reporting, Kham-Wieng
on camera from Wieng Thai, Sa-bai dii.

107
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,000
"I, Chot Petchpantakarn,

108
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,480
declare in this, my last will and testament,

109
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,840
that all my assets and
companies will belong to

110
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,160
Chaichol Petchpantakarn, my son,

111
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,600
who will run all of them
with sole authority."

112
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,920
"Signed: Chot Petchpantakarn."

113
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:39,000
That'll mean Mr Chaichol
will run all the companies. Is that right?

114
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,920
Yes, legally and practically.

115
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Oh, dear! With all due respect,
my dear committee members,

116
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,560
I think he is not yet mature
and experienced enough.

117
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,880
to run such large-scale companies.

118
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,480
- He should have someone as a buddy...
- Songpol.

119
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,640
- Yes?
- You may sell your share. I'll buy it.

120
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,640
Yes, I think Mr Chot wrote the will very well
and with great foresight. Very... very good.

121
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,840
If it's OK, I would like to leave now.

122
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,800
Is there anybody who isn't happy with the will?

123
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,720
And how about you?

124
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,680
- No, it's fine.
- And why are you still here?

125
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,760
- Yes... I am about to leave.
- Right. Thank you.

126
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,800
Chaichol, you have to go home now. I'll see you
at home. I have to have a discussion with them.

127
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,120
Shit! Even if you died,
you could create a problem.

128
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,760
- It's me.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,360
Chaichol is leaving the building.
Tell Artit to capture him alive.

130
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,560
Yes, sir.

131
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,320
- You, go get the car.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,320
What the hell is this?
Unbelievable!

133
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,960
Boss, we were told to get Chaichol alive,
but kill the rest.

134
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,960
Honestly, aren't you embarrassed?
I am embarrassed for you.

135
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,360
Everyone in the company is staring at you!
Can't you dress like others?

136
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,160
Can't you wear a suit
and a wig on your fucking head?

137
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,760
- Do you understand?
- You're mad, aren't you?

138
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
Yes.

139
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,880
Hey, why isn't the lift going down?

140
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,560
You...!

141
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,400
I didn't press the button, sir.

142
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,880
Fucking idiot! Press it! Press it!

143
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,960
Press it!
What an idiot!

144
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,800
- Why did you press " up"? I'm going down.
- Down!

145
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,160
- For fuck's sake!
- Stupid!

146
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,880
Are you frustrated?

147
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,240
- Am I frustrated?!
- Yes!

148
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,000
Reverse!

149
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,440
Please get down, sir!

150
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,120
Help me, please!

151
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,440
- Help me!
- How did he turn up?

152
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,800
Don't shoot! Get him alive!

153
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,640
Where the hell is he?

154
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,080
- Hello, my sugar daddy.
- Ah... Hello

155
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
- Are you OK?
- I'm OK.

156
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,640
- Are you sure? You seem drunk.
- A little bit.

157
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
- Are you going home?
- Yes.

158
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,760
I'll take care of the bill, OK?

159
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,440
Waitress.

160
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,200
One spice sour snapper soup,

161
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,520
fish cakes,

162
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,960
and stir-fried crabs with cumin, to take away.

163
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
And put on an extra 500 baht for me.

164
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,280
- Sweetheart....
- Yes, dear? You ordered more, right?

165
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:08,320
What a mess! What are you doing,
sleeping all over the room, like stray dogs?

166
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Lilly, you sleep like a transvestite being raped.

167
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,040
Pok! Pok! You sleep like a corpse.

168
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,680
Pok! Pok! Why are your heads in that position?
You're sleeping like a 69.

169
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Put your head on the other side. Now!

170
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,480
Oh, dear! How am I going to fit in?

171
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,400
I can see a wristwatch on a human wrist.

172
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,720
No excuses. You've got to tell your men
to follow the rubbish lorry wherever it goes.

173
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,680
Get him.

174
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,800
You don't need a plan.
Do it right now.

175
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,520
Tell Artit to go to Wongkom's home,
just in case the son is hiding there.

176
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,720
But if he isn't there...

177
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,960
kill Wongkom.

178
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,080
Boss.

179
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,760
Sorry. It was my fault.

180
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,840
What a fucking suit!
Can't you see? Can't you dress like us?

181
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,720
What's this fucking wig? What is it?

182
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,040
Next time you think of dressing like that,
don't bother!

183
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
You again!

184
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,360
- Little Chick?
- Yes, Dad?

185
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,840
- Do you love me?
- Of course.

186
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,920
Go inside.

187
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,240
Bye.

188
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,960
Little Chick. Little Chick?

189
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,160
He is dead.

190
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,120
Dome.

191
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
My son's dead.

192
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,840
Dad?

193
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,200
What, Pokey?

194
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,880
Do you love me?

195
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,840
Yes. But you gotta go first.

196
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,920
Pokey... Pokey?

197
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,200
Youngie.

198
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,040
My son's also dead.

199
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,840
- Youngie.
- No need.

200
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,240
We'll go in together,
on the count of three.

201
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,640
One... two... three. Go!

202
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,800
Shithead? Why didn't you come in with me?

203
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,040
- One...
- We go in together.

204
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,240
One... two... three...

205
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Fucking shit.

206
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,760
No. Youngie! Youngie!

207
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,560
He's in the swimming pool.

208
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,760
Check!

209
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,600
Get down! Get down! Get...

210
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,880
Go!

211
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,040
Oh, dear!

212
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,920
Get out of the way, please.
Out of the way!

213
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,720
Get him!

214
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,880
There's a mad naked man
running with a pistol.

215
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,440
- Look at him.
- Follow him.

216
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,880
Get away! Go!

217
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,040
Bangrajan will fall soon

218
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,000
Why has no one gone to get the Royal Army?

219
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Bangrajan will fall soon for good.

220
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,800
Why didn't you go get the Royal Army form me?
Bangrajan will fall soon.

221
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,880
Listen! Why didn't you answer me?

222
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
Anyone there?

223
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,000
OK. If you are not going to say anything,
I'll make sure you talk.

224
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,000
Coming next is "Popular Country Songs".
Let's listen to the first song.

225
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,360
Shit!

226
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,560
I'll call someone to help you!

227
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,520
Knob!

228
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,480
Put the gun down.

229
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,000
Put it down slowly.

230
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,240
Good. Fantastic!

231
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,240
Really fantastic.
Put your hands up.

232
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,800
Slowly, both hands.

233
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
I think one is enough, sir

234
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,120
OK. Let's search him.

235
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,280
With him in that state? There's no need.

236
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,720
Well, he might have a weapon
hidden in the bowl.

237
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,960
MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITAL

238
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
- Tie him up.
- I'm not crazy.

239
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,720
Get in.

240
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,720
I told you to get the Royal Army!
Why are you wasting time?

241
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,640
What? He managed to escape?
Why don't you track him down and kill him?

242
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,800
- Fucking idiot!
- Yes!

243
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,160
What  the hell is this?
Are you taking the mickey?

244
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,360
I am going to hit you.
Hit you? Kill you!

245
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,320
Nutter, you shouldn't have brought me
your problems.

246
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,800
To hell with my luck.

247
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,000
What a mess.
What are we going to do with him?

248
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:26,080
Well, let's wait till he recovers.
We can discuss what are we going to do.

249
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,640
Goodness me.
He's got a high temperature again.

250
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,480
Stop it you horny transvestite.
You get horny whenever you see a man.

251
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,640
I think we should pawn his wristwatch.

252
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,280
Then we'll have money
for his treatment and medicine.

253
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,000
Mother, I know what you are thinking.
Stop thinking now.

254
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,320
You stop! I'm your mother,
not the other way round.

255
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,280
If I knew you'd like this, I'd have stuffed
your mouth with ash when you were born.

256
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,840
- Auntie, is there ash in the hospital?
- Damn! I'll kick you. No manners at all.

257
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,160
Auntie, we should go to the police.

258
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,960
- Please don't.
- Hey, you've come around.

259
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,600
Oh, dear! Slowly, slowly.
Be gentle with him.

260
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,240
Why? Why don't you want us
to tell the police?

261
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,040
Why?

262
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,200
What have you done? What crime?

263
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,160
- Well... I stole something.
- I thought so.

264
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,080
- Thought-so is the name of a northern province.
- Shithead! Eat my foot!

265
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,080
You'll listen to me when you turn to ash.
No manners at all.

266
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
And what did you steal?

267
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,400
- This wristwatch.
- My goodness.

268
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,120
My mother lives in the country
and she is not well.

269
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,720
I had to do it.

270
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,920
Well, even if you didn't do the right thing,
you are a good son.

271
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,880
You show gratitude to your parents.

272
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,440
OK. You may stay here overnight.

273
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,920
Cool! Let him sleep here.

274
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,360
Poor thing. I will look after you.
Auntie, you don't have to worry about him.

275
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,160
You'll sleep here tonight,
and tomorrow morning you will go with me. OK?

276
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,640
Mother!

277
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,600
Quiet! Why are you so ungrateful?

278
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,840
Catch a lot of fish?

279
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,160
Couldn't you see I was fishing in the can?
No fish at all.

280
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,240
Are you crazy?

281
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,640
You must be seriously crazy.
Fucking crazy.

282
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,600
I feel so sorry for you.
Dear, oh, dear!

283
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,240
And where are you off to?

284
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,480
Well, going home, of course.
Shithead!

285
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,280
Why do you stop so often?
When are you going to get home?

286
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:29,400
Can't you see? It's a red light?
Are you fucking blind? It's red.

287
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,800
You are totally nuts. Your brain's gone.
Do you understand? You are fucking nuts.

288
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,520
Getting zapped will make you normal.

289
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,480
- You are nuts.
- It's green now.

290
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,760
Red.

291
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,080
Green.

292
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,760
Red.

293
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
Red.

294
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,560
Fucking shit.
You want the police to arrest me?

295
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,040
You want to taste of my fist. Wanker!

296
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,560
Wongkom.

297
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,040
Yes, Madam?

298
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,760
Wow, dickhead.
Your wife came to pick you up.

299
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,120
Fucking gorgeous!
Can I fuck her tonight?

300
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,600
So beautiful. Your wife, right?

301
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,720
- Everyone from Tony's team is dead?
- Yes.

302
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,320
And Chaichol has disappeared.
I think he was kidnapped.

303
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,640
Is that right? Let me deal with it.

304
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,320
- Sis, are you OK?
- What happened?

305
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,200
Why did you stop so suddenly?

306
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,920
I will give you one last chance!

307
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,520
Go and get the Royal Army!
Bangrajan has nearly fallen now!

308
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,240
You, Melon!

309
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,000
And you, Shitty Gold!
Look after him. Go!

310
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,920
Yes, yes. Go now.
The Burmese will come if we don't go.

311
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,080
How come you gave him 800 baht?
It's too expensive!

312
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,280
300 baht should have been enough.

313
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:11,520
My business will collapse.
You don't work at all. I can't give you 800 baht.

314
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,560
What do you want?

315
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,560
A watch? Again?

316
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,880
I'll give you 300,000 baht.

317
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,200
Take it or leave it.

318
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,040
Um... Can I have 30,000 baht?

319
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,160
Yes.

320
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,880
PAWN SHOP
WE ACCEPT GOLD FOR 6,200 BAHT

321
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,720
Hey! How did it go?
How much did you get?

322
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,640
- I got 30,000 baht.
- Excellent! I never expected that much.

323
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,840
You see, I never take advantage.

324
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:00,760
As the watch is yours, you give me half, OK?

325
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,040
Where have you been so early this morning?

326
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,960
Wow, who's your date?
Your new hubby, right?

327
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,760
You fucking cunt!
Keep that mouth for eating with.

328
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,800
He's a relative from my hometown.

329
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,720
- Get out, cunt!
- I ain't staying with you, you prick.

330
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,520
You beat up women, my fucking husband!
I don't want to stay with you anymore!

331
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,680
You want to fight with me? Get lost!

332
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:45,040
I'm not staying any longer, you prick!
You wife-beater, you fucking loser!

333
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,400
Cunt! No one's gonna put up with you!

334
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,800
I'm away just for three days and
you're unfaithful! Everyone here knows it!

335
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:03,040
As handsome as I am
I can get anybody I want. Go. Bitch!

336
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,400
What are you looking at?
You want to get hurt? Go!

337
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,840
Have you never seen people arguing?
Fuck off!

338
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Do you want a fight?

339
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,080
Ten years far away from you,
I can still remember,

340
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,640
Coming back, a dog still remembers its owner.

341
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,120
Three days after leaving your wife,
she doesn't care.

342
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,160
Oh, dear, my wife is worse than a dog -
she's a whore.

343
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,920
- Shithead. You want a fight?
- Heartless.

344
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,600
- Get the fuck out of my sight.
- Yes, dear.

345
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,400
I'm so happy today.

346
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Hey, can I have
one prawn tom-yam to take away,

347
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,640
one beans stir-fried with sweet basil,

348
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,560
one pork fried with garlic and black pepper,

349
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,120
one soup with rare meat,
and no bean sprouts.

350
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,080
I changed my mind. No soup.
Just the three dishes.

351
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,720
Gong and Chai, can you take all these
back home? I gotta go now. OK?

352
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,120
And where are you off to?

353
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:31,240
It's none of your fucking business!
I'm playing cards. Leave me alone!

354
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Dad! Dad!

355
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,760
Hey! It's nearly ten o'clock.
Go to school now.

356
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,040
You're all late every day.

357
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,520
And when are you going to finish school?
Here's the money. Now go. Quick!

358
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,760
Don't get into a fight, OK?
I don't want to have to deal with it.

359
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,000
You like fucking,
but why doesn't your husband stay with you?

360
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,000
Shit your gob, bitch!
What about you? You like to suck dick?

361
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,600
Suck and no one criticises you.

362
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,000
No wonder your hubby comes home on time.
Because you like to suck.

363
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,200
Do you want to play cards?
Do you? Wanna play?

364
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Bitch. You suck and you fuck.
You're so horny.

365
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,960
Put one card down, Waew.

366
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,400
- Why are you sitting still?
- I forgot.

367
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,680
You're so damn slow.

368
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,560
I've got you,
hook, line and sinker!

369
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,040
Bitch! I've got no money left.

370
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,240
No money left. You deal with it, OK?
You've sucked me dry.

371
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,520
- How will we divide the money?
- She's moody.

372
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,720
- I've told you, don't let her play.
- I'm fed up with her.

373
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,840
Get out of my way.
Go sit somewhere else.

374
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,640
No, not here. Down there on the floor.
I'm knackered. Quick!

375
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Oh, dear.

376
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,600
- I'm hungry. So fucking hungry.
- Me too.

377
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,520
So hungry, my tummy is rumbling.

378
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,160
Why? Is no food provided
where you do your charity?

379
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,960
- There was, but I didn't eat,
- Auntie, Pok pretended to be an angel.

380
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,040
She gave all the food to the children.
Only three boxes, and there was my name on it.

381
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,080
You're so generous, regardless of status. Bitch!

382
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,560
Lee, why the hell are you complaining?
Don't you feel sorry for the poor children?

383
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,040
There was no food, let alone shelter.

384
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:45,440
When all of you come home, there is food.

385
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,520
That's right. Eat at my house.

386
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,120
Are you thinking of settling down here?
Don't you have any desire to move out?

387
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,200
I let him stay.
Do you have any problem with that?

388
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,560
Who would dare to challenge Mummy!

389
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,680
Good! I'd better go to work.
So annoying. Look after the house.

390
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,200
Be careful! When you run out of omen,
my mother will get you out of the house.

391
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,040
- Thank you.
- Goodness!

392
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,680
We have the land,
we have the labour, the tools.

393
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,600
What we lack is the capital to build.

394
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,480
That's precisely the problem.
Teacher, what would you like us to do?

395
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,960
To make ends meet is so damned hard,
Teacher.

396
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,640
Teacher! Do you want to
suck the blood out of us builders?

397
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:59,720
When we're sick,
we barely have enough money to buy a medicine.

398
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,000
How are we going to scrape any up for you?

399
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,680
You should apply for a 30-baht card
for all treatments

400
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,240
and donate the money you save on medicine
to the teacher. That's sorted.

401
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:16,080
Nit, are you crazy? And where are we going
to get money to pay for childcare

402
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,120
when we earn so little already?

403
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:27,000
Suthin, calm down. Don't worry about that.
We will have volunteers from the charity.

404
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:32,080
They will take it in turns to teach.
We don't have to pay them anything at all.

405
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:38,040
Ah, Thaksa.
Don't you want to express your opinion?

406
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,760
Normally, you are so chatty.

407
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,720
It's a good idea.

408
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:51,000
OK. If you think it's a good idea, if you want
to make a donation, feel free to do so.

409
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:58,080
It's not compulsory.
I know you don't have a lot of money to spare.

410
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,720
I'll try to get some funding
from the charity.

411
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,920
But, for the time being,
you all have to get the land sorted.

412
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,520
Whoever's free, come and help.

413
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:18,440
OK, all sorted. Let's agree on this.
Thank you all for coming to the meeting.

414
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:24,320
I would like to draw the meeting to a close.
Thank you. Thanks, everybody.

415
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:08,480
Teacher, how much do you need
in order to look after the children?

416
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,080
To make it work,
we need to have bathrooms, bedrooms,

417
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,600
and teaching equipment and materials.

418
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,520
I think we need at least 100,000 baht.

419
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:30,200
Talking about this worries me a great deal.
I think I'll only manage to build the roof.

420
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,400
Don't give up.

421
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,280
I could talk to my old boss.
He's very kind and likes helping people.

422
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,680
I'll call him to see how he can help
with this project.

423
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,840
If we can get his help,
the children will be grateful.

424
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,800
Chai.  Are you all right, son?

425
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,840
I'm OK, Mum. I'm fine.
Don't worry, please.

426
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,400
And... where are you?
Can you tell me?

427
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,440
I'll ask Wongkom to pick you up.

428
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,120
Absolutely not, Mum.

429
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,520
And when are you coming back home?

430
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,920
- I love you, Mum.
- I know.

431
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,720
- Chai?
- Madam, it's me. Wongkom.

432
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:32,360
You see, Wongkom...
Chaichol has just called. He...

433
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,800
Madam, listen to me carefully.
Your phone is being tapped.

434
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:42,040
You mustn't answer the phone.
I'll take care of Chaichol. I've got to go.

435
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,760
Chaichol used the 142 phone booth,
zone three.

436
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,200
- That's in the slum area.
- That's right.

437
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,560
But as for Wongkom,
we haven't tracked his signal yet.

438
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,000
He uses some kind of interference.

439
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,600
The electric box
gives you loads of money!

440
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,560
Don't tell anybody, OK?
I'll buy you some sweets.

441
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,480
- Can I have ice cream as well?
- Sure. I'll get you three pots.

442
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,560
- Let's go.
- Yes.

443
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,920
Today, Chaichol went to get 100,000 baht
from Pop's department store cash machine.

444
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,080
Get your men to wait for him there,
just in case he turns up again.

445
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,840
And double your team.
Make sure the area is searched thoroughly.

446
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,480
Understood?

447
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,160
Perfect!

448
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,520
- Hey. Why don't you start the car?
- I can't drive.

449
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,120
You can't drive?
Then why the fuck are you sitting there?

450
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,080
- And you can drive. Go and drive now!
- Yes, sir.

451
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,040
For fuck's sake.

452
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,720
Neat.

453
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,760
Let me help you.

454
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,640
You know how to use a computer, don't you?

455
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,760
Well... my old boss taught me a little.
That's why I can use it a bit.

456
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,760
I saw you talking to two Westerners.
You can chat in English as well, I suppose.

457
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:01,720
Well... my old boss is a Westerner.
That's why I can speak it a bit.

458
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,520
Now you're better, why don't you leave?

459
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,160
Well, where do you want me to go?

460
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,520
It's up to you.
Wherever you fancy. Just go.

461
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,280
- If it's up to me, I'll stay put.
- What?

462
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,120
Pok! Lilly!
There was a road accident. Quick!

463
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,800
Quick! Come and help me!

464
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,440
Here! Here! Here!

465
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,320
Press the wound on the leg!

466
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,840
Do you hear me?

467
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,400
Over here! He is conscious now!

468
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,520
On my first day at work,
I was like you.

469
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,640
Here's some water. Rinse it.

470
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:41,320
Pok! Pok! Someone is very critical here.

471
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,960
Come here, quick. He just feels sick,
but he's not going to die.

472
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,720
Come on!

473
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,400
Bitch!

474
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,800
I wasn't swearing at you.
I was calling to my friend.

475
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,360
- He's come round.
- Yes.

476
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,920
- Lilly! Come here on this side.
- Me again?

477
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,720
Did a dung truck drive past here?

478
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,720
Boss? Boss?

479
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,480
Hello. Yes... yes...

480
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,320
Wow! 100,000 baht!

481
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,960
This guy helped us get as much as
100,000 baht for our project.

482
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,240
Let's give him round of applause
for his work.

483
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,480
Hey, you!
I know where you got the money from.

484
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,040
What money?

485
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,400
- Don't play the innocent.
- Really?

486
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,600
Nutter told me you got the money
out of the cash machine.

487
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:38,320
Don't listen to him.
You can't believe anything what he says.

488
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:45,120
- You two go and get the stuff on this first.
- OK.

489
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,560
- Get back here as soon as you can. Quick! Go!
- Yes, sir.

490
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,680
Chai? Pok! You're the she-devil
of the community.

491
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,320
When jobs and fortunes are gone,

492
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,560
one is left with only goodness,

493
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,120
leaving treasures for the people.

494
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,840
Even your body will be burned on the pyre.

495
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,640
Please forgive everybody.

496
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,240
I'm not dead yet. I was just napping.
Shithead!

497
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,840
Is that so?

498
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,240
- Give me my money back.
- I know, I know.

499
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,560
Fuck off. Fucking annoying, you are.

500
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,400
You don't look like a thief at all.

501
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,400
I believe what Nutter said.

502
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:05,480
And how did you find 100,000 baht
to help the teacher that quickly?

503
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,200
- Pok, have you got a boyfriend yet?
- Hey, weren't you listening?

504
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,080
- What do you want to talk about, exactly?
- Well... let's talk about me first.

505
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,800
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- OK. Not yet.

506
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,280
What about you?
Got a girlfriend?

507
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,200
I'm about to get one.
She's from around here.

508
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,200
370 baht in total, please.
Thank you. Please come again.

509
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,400
Pok?

510
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:27,040
I'm really scared. Don't hurt me.
Please take whatever you want.

511
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,120
It's not mine. Take it all.

512
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,840
You! We're not here to rob you.
Open the door. Turn the signal off. Quick!

513
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:45,040
I've got two children.
My wife doesn't work. She just lives off me.

514
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,520
- Don't hurt me.
- Open the fucking door!

515
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:53,440
Yes, yes. And my mother's at the hospital.
My father has a kidney failure.

516
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,120
And my older brother is a soldier,
and he's tough.

517
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,880
If he finds out I'm in trouble,
he and his mates will come as a battalion.

518
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,720
It's my brother calling.

519
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,600
You... don't have to come now. It's too late.

520
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,960
You talk too much, shithead.

521
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,520
Hey, you! Open the door.
Turn the signal off! Now!

522
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,880
Go! Go wherever.

523
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,360
Go. Don't wriggle.

524
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,160
Police!

525
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Don't wriggle!

526
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,480
- How many of them are there?
- I don't know. I came with you, sir.

527
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Pass me the loudspeaker.

528
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,400
To the people who are inside, please...

529
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,880
- Is it on?
- You didn't order it, sir.

530
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,200
Do I have to order you around?

531
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:32,040
To the people who are inside, please
put your guns down and release the hostages.

532
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,120
You are surrounded by police.

533
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,920
Did they hear us?

534
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know anything.

535
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,720
Go and get the NP.

536
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,320
Excuse me, sir. What does NP mean?

537
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,120
Negotiating policeman, you idiot!

538
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,200
- Go.
- You! Go get the negotiating policeman.

539
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,360
What?

540
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,720
- Sir, he took his family for a holiday in Phuket.
- Great, isn't it?

541
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,800
You take the phone to them.

542
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:27,760
We are now sending our man
to give you a phone.

543
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,280
Let's talk. Our man is unarmed.

544
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,960
OK?

545
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,880
- Can I speak to your leader?
- Are you sure you want?

546
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,880
I'm sure.

547
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,800
OK.

548
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,840
Boss.

549
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:24,760
Hey. Am I talking to an alien?
The voice is unintelligible.

550
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,800
Boss...
Boss, let me talk to him.

551
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,520
Let me.

552
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,180
Yes.

553
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,080
Hey!

554
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,760
I need a car.

555
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,200
What model?

556
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,360
Any fucking model, as long as
it can fit in seven or eight people.

557
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,320
I'll give you 30 minutes.

558
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:02,080
Wait, wait, wait. Is 40 minutes OK?

559
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,680
35 minutes. OK?
Let's meet halfway.

560
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:13,160
38 minutes. OK?
Given that it's a charity.

561
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,120
36 minutes. That's the best I can do.

562
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,200
I'm not benefiting from it.
I'm not asking for too much. OK?

563
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,680
That's it. Bye.

564
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,800
Go and get the MS.

565
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,000
- That means "Miss", right, sir?
- Come to see your fucking dad?

566
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,680
- It's the SWAT unit! Have you never heard of it?
- Yes, sir.

567
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,800
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

568
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,160
Dickhead.
You're running like you're shitting yourself.

569
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,640
Quick! Get in! Let me in!

570
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:53,720
This is not a training exercise, that is real.
Do your best and keep up to the plan. Understood?

571
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,680
Yes, sir.

572
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,480
Unknown men have robbed a department store
and are holding some staff hostage.

573
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:02,040
- Follow the procedure. Understood?
- Yes, sir!

574
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,880
Use your intelligence,
be cool and be patient,

575
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,480
and when we finish this task,
we can go back to our families safely.

576
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,680
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

577
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,240
- Can't you say something else?
- Yes, sir!

578
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,440
Excellent! Weapons at the ready.

579
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,160
Camouflage.

580
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,440
We are under attack.
Get out!

581
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,320
Quick! Quick!

582
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:41,800
The SWAT unit, where are they?
Where? Come out! Come out!

583
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,480
- Come out!
- Commander. Commander.

584
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,960
- Why are calling me?
- A tyre's blown, sir.

585
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,320
Don't wriggle.

586
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,000
Yes, boss.

587
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,000
It's been ten minutes.

588
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:01,360
- Dickhead. What the fuck are they doing?
- My boss flares up easily.

589
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,880
Hey. Are you sucking the blood from him?

590
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:18,040
Sir, it's the SWAT unit's vehicle.
A tyre's blown.

591
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,560
Why does the SWAT unit
have this problem now?

592
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,560
They're so fucking slow.
Shit! Dickhead!

593
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,640
- Whose dick do you mean?
- My dick.

594
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:34,720
Boss, 11 minutes now.
He loves talking.

595
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,880
- Dickhead.
- Stay still, will you?

596
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,240
Go get the TA.

597
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,280
- What is...?
- Twin assassins!

598
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:47,200
Twin assassins! You hear me?
You're such an idiot!

599
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,680
We don't want anybody to get killed,
so stop sending your men.

600
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,040
Hey. What unit is coming?

601
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:41,280
DK, sir.

602
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,080
DK? DK? What is DK?

603
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,480
- Don't know, sir.
- Don't know... What?

604
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,160
Don't think you can get away with that.

605
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,240
- Hey!
- What's going on?

606
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,320
Find a place to hide, country bumpkin.

607
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,080
You're gonna die!

608
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,280
- Thanks, buddy.
- No big deal, Humlae.

609
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,200
That's another film, dickhead.

610
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,200
Chai.

611
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,080
Pok!

612
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,920
Let go! Let go!

613
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,320
Pok!

614
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,840
- Leave Pok alone!
- Go! Go! Go!

615
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,080
Quick, quick!

616
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,960
Pok! Pok!

617
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,080
- Get in the car. Now!
- Let go. Pok! Pok!

618
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,360
Wanker!

619
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,960
Do you know what have you just done?

620
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:01,360
What is it?
Why are you so nasty to him?

621
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,320
He has just saved your life.

622
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:09,160
- I'm going to help her.
- Boss, don't go anywhere right now.

623
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,680
It's dangerous.

624
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,120
I'm close to tracking down
who's behind it.

625
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,760
- Please stay put here, for your own safety.
- I agree with him.

626
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,840
Yes, I agree with him.

627
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,160
As for that young girl, I'll take care of her.

628
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:30,000
If she's alive, I'll bring her back.
I promise.

629
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,760
TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP

630
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,400
Sign it.

631
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,280
Then we can end it quickly.

632
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,160
You won't get even a penny.

633
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:15,200
Is that so? Well, shall we see?

634
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,800
Let's see what I will get from you.

635
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,200
You.

636
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,080
Go and get them!

637
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,840
You! Go and get them!

638
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,120
Go!

639
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,280
Wait and see.

640
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,760
You idiot! Why did you fucking bring him?
He's one of us.

641
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,160
- That's right!
- Get another one. Another one.

642
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,800
Are you mad or drunk? Go!

643
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,040
Sign!

644
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,080
That's right.

645
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,160
Uncle!

646
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,640
Don't sign.
Whether you sign or not, we're gonna die.

647
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,000
Sign now!
Shall we see some blood first?

648
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,440
Sign! Now!

649
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,160
You. Deal with him.

650
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,000
Don't sign.

651
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,000
Uncle! Uncle!

652
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,840
Uncle!

653
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:51,880
Are you going to sign now?
No? Let's have another demonstration.

654
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,960
Go and get that person.

655
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,200
You love to see blood gushing out
before you sign, right?

656
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Be gentle with me.

657
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,880
Mother!

658
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,960
- Son!
- Mother!

659
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:15,240
Don't you dare wriggle.
Do you want her to die like your father did?

660
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,240
Sign!

661
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,120
Sign. Sign.

662
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,040
Here.

663
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,240
Sign!

664
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,280
- Yes.
- Excellent.

665
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,840
This is it.

666
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,560
All done, boss.

667
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,000
We got the signature.

668
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,320
Easy, wasn't it?

669
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,440
- Choung!
- Shut up!

670
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,440
This... are you behind this?

671
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,280
Shut your gob!

672
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:22,440
It's OK. This document hasn't got a seal.
It's not valid.

673
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,000
What fucking seal
are you talking about, lawyer?

674
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,360
And where is it?

675
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:34,720
She hasn't got it. What the seal is, you have to
get Wongkom's thumb stamped on it.

676
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:40,560
You fucking shit!
Even though you're dead, you still make trouble.

677
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,840
Call him, now!

678
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,960
- Wongkom.
- Release her and her son. Now.

679
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,080
And the lawyer as well.

680
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,760
You can't use guns here.

681
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,600
Then what shall we do?

682
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:30,120
You stamp your thumbprint here.
Quickly! Don't make a big fuss,

683
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,000
- so we can finish this business.
- Sure.

684
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,400
But you'll have to break my arm first.

685
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,640
You want to be crippled? Sure.

686
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,960
Baldie, go!

687
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,200
- You fucking shit! Get out of my fucking sight!
- You go!

688
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,040
Go!

689
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,200
- Sunny.
- Yes, sir?

690
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,960
Cool. I'm going now.

691
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,640
Go!

692
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,800
Is it too painful?

693
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,840
Wake up!

694
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,360
Now you know who's the boss.

695
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,240
Mummy! Goodbye, Mum.

696
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,920
What's he playing at?

697
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,360
Oh... I'm fractured.

698
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,120
- Come on. What's the matter? Try this.
- No.

699
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:43,520
No? No? I'm kicking you. How about that?
You're a champion, right?

700
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,120
Fuck your Thai boxing.

701
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,760
How about a kick in the groin?

702
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,480
You said we couldn't use guns.

703
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,800
The sign's gone now.

704
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:25,040
Hey, go the other way, You're shooting
near my ear, for fuck's sake! Go!

705
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,280
- What?
- Don't you fucking "what" me! Go!

706
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,200
Dickhead! He's there!

707
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,200
Don't! Wongkom!

708
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:19,280
Sister-in-law, I'm so sorry. It was my fault.
Please forgive me.

709
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,320
You feel guilty now, do you?
How about this?

710
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,280
You...

711
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,720
You are shit-faced.

712
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,280
You are two-faced.

713
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,680
- Fuck-faced, madam!
- What?

714
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,280
- Fu...
- Enough, Mum. Let the police deal with him.

715
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,960
Let's go.

716
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:57,000
Wongkom, I have to apologise
for the way I've treated you.

717
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,360
That's OK. It's my duty anyway.

718
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,600
Why are you arresting me?
What have I done wrong?

719
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,960
We're near the end of the film
and I still haven't had a big part.

720
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:11,160
Only one scene where I say three words!
Where's the director?

721
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,720
- At the police station.
- You poking fun at me?

722
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:19,600
That's the fucking director, standing there!
You trapped me into this. You shit! Wanker!

723
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:24,240
You talk in the film and no one understands you.
I talk coherently, but I'm not allowed to.

724
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,170
You shit! Don't let me see you again!

725
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:33,440
Boss, that girl you wanted to save
is still alive.

726
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,120
Really?

727
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:39,640
Mum, I'd like to get married.

728
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,680
- You want to get married?
- Yes.

729
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:48,200
Wait till I have a chance to make a film!
I'll have you naked for the whole film. Shit!

730
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,280
How can you treat me like this?
Me, a comedy superstar!

731
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,560
In the whole film I said only three words!

732
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,280
When you're no longer popular,
don't come to me!

733
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:00,680
Now we know who was behind Chot's murder.
It was his younger brother.

734
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,880
At the moment, we are about to see the unexpected
wedding procession of his only son.

735
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:11,440
We will keep you updated as to
when and where it will end and who the bride is.

736
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,760
CHANNEL 5 NEWS

737
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,440
Nutty, eat.

738
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:54,600
Eat? Don't worry about me.
I ate earlier.

739
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,680
Pok, eat.

740
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:11,200
Don't call her.
With her symptoms, she won't eat.

741
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:15,760
When I was 17 or 18, I was like her.

742
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,120
She's fallen in love.
Looks like there's the problem.

743
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,920
When you have a problem, go to the loo.
What kind of fish is in the water?

744
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,720
My own fucking foot.

745
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,480
It can be either on land or under water.
Or even on your face.

746
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,000
Play at the wrong place, at the wrong time,
I'll stitch up your gob!

747
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,240
I'm in a bad mood now. Again.

748
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,800
Hey, that's Jam's house.

749
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:42,160
That's him at your house.

750
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
On channel 7.

751
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:48,880
On TV, Auntie.
He's outside our house.

752
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,840
He's in front of our house.

753
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:55,600
Pok, he's outside. That's him.

754
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,640
- Pok?
- What?

755
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,960
Will you marry me?

756
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,400
Put it on. Yes.

757
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:31,880
I've always had an eye
for the real thing.

758
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:34,160
What are you fucking staring at?

759
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Good, good!

760
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:45,520
Pok! Bitch! You're fucking spoiling everything.

761
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,440
Is this how you betray your best mate?

762
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:53,480
You've got to kill me now.
Why did you poo on my heart?

763
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,160
I really want to die!

764
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:01,120
When love is new,
even spinach soup is sweet.

765
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:10,880
Excellent, excellent.
Hug each other. Hug now. You both look good.

766
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,520
Why don't you go to the bedroom?
It's empty.

767
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,800
This is great. I love it.

768
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,280
I'm so happy. It's empty. Go inside.

769
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:23,840
Now everything is back to normal.

770
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:29,200
Some people still wonder
who was behind the crime.

771
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:35,240
It was quite straightforward.
It was just a hitman who had a contract to kill.

772
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:39,040
The person who wanted him dead
was his younger brother.

773
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:43,920
It had been Mr Choung,
who was the younger brother of Mr Chot.

774
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,800
Mr Chot was the father of Chaichol.

775
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:52,320
Mr Chaichol is the nephew of Mr Choung.
You're starting to get confused now, right?

776
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,280
But I'm not confused at all,
because I'm reporting this news.

777
01:30:55,360 --> 01:31:02,520
Now, Mr Chaichol has a passionate herb -
no, I mean surprising.

778
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,280
Lemongrass -  we use it for cooking.
That's right, isn't it?

779
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:09,520
We were surprised
because he unexpectedly got married.

780
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,000
It was a lightning ceremony -
done in a flash.

781
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:16,560
It's going to rain. Rain and then lightning.
It was almost impossible to report.

782
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:21,240
I am reporting on the wedding procession.

783
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:26,560
I will keep you updated
as to where and how.

784
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:32,320
We'll do focus news. We'll go to his house.
But we can't go inside the bedroom.

785
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,680
If I go in there,
I might see something obscene,

786
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:42,080
and we really can't broadcast it.
But we will follow them.

787
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,280
Is that enough?

788
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,360
- Enough, now?
- A little bit more.

789
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:50,360
I will keep reporting
because the director has told me to do so.

790
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:54,520
About the wedding,
I think it'll be probably enough.

791
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,600
- A little.
- A little?

792
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:02,360
He forced me to do it.
I've been waiting since this morning.

793
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,040
Enough?

794
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,560
He said it was up to me.

795
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,560
Kham-Sai reporting from Wieng Thai,
Sa-bai dii.

796
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,640
I might not be able to get down.

797
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,280
Shoot. Shoot now.

798
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:12,560
Get me down.

799
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,880
Let go of the rope.

800
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:30,880
When I count to three, run. OK?

801
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,540
One... Wait.

802
01:33:58,020 --> 01:33:59,760
Lovely dance.

803
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:08,040
Great. Very good.
Good, good, good.

804
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:39,200
- Start!
- I'm afraid of heights.

805
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:43,760
- Find out who I am. Find out.
- Find out who I am.

806
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,540
Is that right, Little Chick?

807
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:52,240
Go! I'm away for a few days and you...

808
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:57,240
Go! You think I...

809
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:06,800
You've been unfaithful! How dare you?
You think I don't have...

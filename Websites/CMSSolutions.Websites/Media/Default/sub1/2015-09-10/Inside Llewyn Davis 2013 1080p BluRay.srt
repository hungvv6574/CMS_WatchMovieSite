1
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,715
Hang me, oh, hang me.

2
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,340
<i>I'll be dead and gone.</i>

3
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,387
<i>Hang me, oh, hang me.</i>

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,470
<i>I'll be dead and gone.</i>

5
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,728
<i>I wouldn't mind the hanging.</i>

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,695
<i>But the laying in the grave so long
poor boy.</i>

7
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:16,528
<i>I've been all around this world.</i>

8
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,245
<i>Been all around cape girardeau.</i>

9
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,378
<i>Parts of Arkansas.</i>

10
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,509
<i>All around cape girardeau.</i>

11
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,762
<i>Parts of Arkansas.</i>

12
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,890
<i>I got so goddamn hungry.</i>

13
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:44,895
<i>I could hide behind a straw
poor boy.</i>

14
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:49,476
<i>I've been all around this world.</i>

15
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,279
<i>Went up on the Mountain.</i>

16
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,454
<i>There I made my stand.</i>

17
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,333
<i>Went up on the Mountain.</i>

18
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:09,380
<i>There I made my stand.</i>

19
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,133
<i>A rifle on my shoulder.</i>

20
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,429
<i>And a dagger in my hand
poor boy.</i>

21
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,932
<i>I been all around this world.</i>

22
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,808
<i>Put the rope around my neck.</i>

23
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,733
<i>Hang me up so high.</i>

24
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,574
<i>Put the rope around my neck.</i>

25
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,075
<i>They hung me up so high.</i>

26
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:47,041
<i>The last words I heard 'em say:</i>

27
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:51,420
<i>"Won't be long now 'fore you die
poor boy".</i>

28
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:56,718
<i>I've been all around this world.</i>

29
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:03,099
<i>So hang me, oh, hang me.</i>

30
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,521
<i>And I'll be dead and gone.</i>

31
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:12,066
<i>Hang me, oh, hang me.</i>

32
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,773
<i>And I'll be dead and gone.</i>

33
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,033
<i>Wouldn't mind the hanging.</i>

34
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,579
<i>But the laying in the grave so long
poor boy.</i>

35
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,502
<i>I've been all around this world.</i>

36
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,177
You probably heard
that one before.

37
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,105
If it was never new and it never
gets old, then it's a folk song.

38
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,607
- You and Mikey used to do that song.
- Yeah.

39
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,616
Boy, you were some mess last night.

40
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,286
Yeah, sorry, pappi.
I'm an asshole.

41
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,748
I don't give a shit.
It's just music.

42
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,293
Your friend is out back.

43
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,626
My friend?

44
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,673
Said he was a friend
of yours. Guy in a suit.

45
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,597
You a funny boy, huh?

46
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,726
What?

47
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:40,070
Had to open your big mouth,
huh, funny boy?

48
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,069
I had to... what?

49
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,660
That's what I do for a living.
Who...? Who are you?

50
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,863
What you do.

51
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,204
What you do.

52
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,336
I'm sorry, what...? What did I...?

53
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:01,217
You sit there in the audience
last night, yelling your crap.

54
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,967
Oh, for christssake.
You yell stuff, man. It's a show.

55
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,349
It wasn't your show.

56
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,727
It's not the opera, jackass.
It's a fucking basket hou... unh!

57
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,808
We're leaving this fucking cesspool.
You can have it.

58
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,852
What you do.

59
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,138
Hello?

60
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,973
No, no...

61
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,682
Shit.

62
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,022
Goddamn it.

63
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,540
Hello?

64
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,749
Hi.

65
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,883
Could you, um...?

66
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,631
Could I leave this cat with you?

67
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,513
- With me?
- Yeah, it's, um...

68
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,058
It's the gorfeins' cat.
Just till one of them gets back?

69
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,308
With me?

70
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,394
It slipped out
and I don't have the key.

71
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,396
Could you just keep it
till they get back?

72
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,020
I have to run the elevator.

73
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,487
I mean, that's not a problem, is it?
It's the gorfeins' cat.

74
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,190
I have to run the elevator.

75
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,076
- Sociology.
- Professor gorfein, please.

76
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,369
<i>He's in a lecture now.</i>

77
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,163
<i>- Could I take a message?
- Uh...</i>

78
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,915
Yeah, could you...?
Could you just tell him:

79
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,251
"Don't worry, llewyn has the cat"?

80
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,461
<i>"Llewyn is the cat."</i>

81
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,337
No, llewyn "has" the cat.
I'm llewyn. I have his cat.

82
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,728
Oh, shit.

83
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,865
- Hey, nunzio.
- Yeah. They ain't home, though.

84
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,068
Yeah, I know.
Can I use your fire escape?

85
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,016
Hi.

86
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,151
- How we doing?
- We're doing great.

87
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,527
Really?

88
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,237
The new record's doing well?

89
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,740
Uh, how "we" doing.
Not so hot, I gotta be honest.

90
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,618
- Ginny, where's Cincinnati?
- What?

91
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,955
- Cincinnati, it's not in here.
- It should be in there.

92
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,457
It's not in here, I'm telling you.

93
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,750
- Is it...?
- Cincinnati?

94
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,836
- Yeah.
- I got it.

95
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,129
What?

96
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,923
- I got it.
- You got Cincinnati?

97
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,341
Yeah, you want it?

98
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,385
- Could I have it?
- Should I bring it in?

99
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,804
- Yeah.
- Do you owe me something?

100
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,472
You have to owe me something.

101
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,891
I wish.

102
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,893
People need time, you know.

103
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,062
Get to know you,
buy you as a solo act.

104
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,607
Even know you're a solo act.

105
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,526
- Cincinnati is not good.
- That's it, right?

106
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,361
Yeah, this is it, God help me.

107
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,197
Nobody knew us
when we were a duo.

108
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,574
It's not like me and Mike
were ever a big act.

109
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,076
It's not a big reeducation

110
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,779
for the public.

111
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,660
Mel?

112
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,410
Mel.

113
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,666
How you doing, kid?

114
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,924
Mel, there was no advance
on my solo record.

115
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,717
There's gotta be some royalty.

116
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,137
Fucking christssake, it's cold out.
I don't even have a winter coat.

117
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,717
Jesus Christ. You're kidding me.

118
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,233
- Take this, kid.
- Mel, no.

119
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,442
I insist. I insist.

120
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,778
I don't want your fucking coat.
What'll you wear?

121
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,781
- Kid, I'll get by.
- It won't even fit me. This is...

122
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,407
It's bullshit, Mel.

123
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,327
It's just a big fat fucking bluff.

124
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,658
Bluff?

125
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,583
Kid, what are you ta...? Bluff?
I offer you this?

126
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,084
Get the fuck out of my office.

127
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,881
- All right, thanks for the coat.
- What?

128
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,709
All right, well, wait.

129
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,511
Aw, shit.

130
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,882
Let me give you 40 bucks.

131
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,822
- Explain the cat.
- Yeah, sorry.

132
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,741
It's, uh... it's the gorfeins' cat.

133
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,536
- I crashed there last night.
- What's its name?

134
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,664
Uh, I don't know.
He snuck out the door when...

135
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,666
Do you think you're
staying here tonight?

136
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,335
"Do you think...?" Um...

137
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,337
- I was hoping to. Is Jim around?
- Jim's not here.

138
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,548
We told Troy he could crash here.

139
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,174
Troy Nelson. How are you?

140
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,427
- How you doing? Llewyn Davis.
- Oh.

141
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,679
Hello. I've heard your music,

142
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,683
and heard many nice things about you
from Jim and Jean and from others.

143
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,895
Ha-ha-ha. You have not heard
one nice thing about me from Jean,

144
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,480
ever, have you, Troy?

145
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,649
You tell the gorfeins
you'll take care of their cat,

146
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,484
then bring him here
for us to take care of.

147
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,529
I've heard nice things from
Jim and Jean and others.

148
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,489
I didn't... it just happened.

149
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,284
It's a peaceful cat.
It's very contented.

150
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,370
So I can't stay here tonight?

151
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,497
Look, we told Troy he could stay.

152
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,121
We don't keep the couch free
on the chance you'll show up.

153
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,918
If this is awkward,

154
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,379
I could hitch back to fort dix
after I perform tonight.

155
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,381
Don't be silly.
We offered you the couch.

156
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,966
You're gigging somewhere?

157
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,385
Troy is playing at the gaslight.
We're meeting Jim there.

158
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:09,264
Well, I could sleep on the floor here,
and llewyn could have the couch.

159
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,641
I'm certainly not a
man of comforts.

160
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,265
Alternately, I could hitch back
to fort dix after the show.

161
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,939
Llewyn can sleep on the
floor with his cat.

162
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,938
It's the gorfeins' cat.

163
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,731
What the fuck?

164
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:31,746
<i>It's a lesson too late
for the learner.</i>

165
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:38,079
<i>Made of sand, made of sand.</i>

166
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:44,132
<i>In the wink of an eye
my soul is turning.</i>

167
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:49,930
<i>In your hand, in your hand.</i>

168
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:56,144
<i>Are you going away
with no word of farewell?</i>

169
00:14:56,145 --> 00:15:02,692
<i>Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well, I could've loved you better.</i>

170
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,902
- Llewyn.
- Hey.

171
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,570
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

172
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,906
<i>I didn't mean to be unkind.</i>

173
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:13,113
<i>You know that was
the last thing on my mind.</i>

174
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,082
<i>You've got reasons aplenty
for going.</i>

175
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,004
- What do you think?
- What?

176
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,424
Him, Troy.

177
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,717
Wonderful performer.

178
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,887
- Is he?
- Wonderful.

179
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,889
<i>Please don't go.</i>

180
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,852
- Does he have a higher function?
- Shh!

181
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,895
<i>Are you going away</i>

182
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,105
I need a drink.

183
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,024
<i>With no word of farewell?</i>

184
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,234
<i>Will there be not a change.</i>

185
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,361
Look, Jim,
I didn't wanna mention this

186
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,572
in front of Jean.
You know how she gets.

187
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:52,619
- What do you mean?
- Just, uh, you know...

188
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,663
I need to...
I need to borrow some money.

189
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,999
I can pay you back really soon,
that and the last loan.

190
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,626
There's a girl I know who's in trouble
and needs to get fixed.

191
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,421
- Not again.
- This is a different girl.

192
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,590
Don't tell Jean.

193
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,010
I can't get the money
without Jean knowing.

194
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,387
- It's okay. We can...
- No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

195
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,681
I'll find it somewhere else.

196
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,099
Thank you very much.

197
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,098
Thank you.

198
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,106
There's someone special
in the audience tonight

199
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,066
who'll maybe get up
and help me out here

200
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,569
- if you give a round of applause.
- I don't have my guitar.

201
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,529
I know that you folks know them
and love them.

202
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,325
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jim and Jean.

203
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,244
Oh.

204
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:01,686
<i>If you miss the train I'm on.</i>

205
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,815
<i>You will know that I am gone.</i>

206
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,736
<i>You can hear the whistle blow.</i>

207
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,990
<i>A hundred Miles.</i>

208
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:18,078
<i>A hundred Miles, a hundred Miles.</i>

209
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,499
<i>A hundred Miles, a hundred Miles.</i>

210
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,378
<i>You can hear the whistle blow.</i>

211
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:30,425
<i>A hundred Miles.</i>

212
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,970
<i>Lord, I'm one, lord, I'm two.</i>

213
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:39,051
<i>Lord, I'm three, lord, I'm four.</i>

214
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,228
<i>Lord, I'm 500 Miles.</i>

215
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:47,399
<i>Away from home.</i>

216
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:55,400
<i>Away from home, away from home.</i>

217
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,869
<i>Lord, I'm 500 Miles.</i>

218
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,916
<i>Away from home.</i>

219
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,795
<i>Not a shirt on my back.</i>

220
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,507
<i>Not a penny to my name.</i>

221
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:18,305
<i>Lord, I can't go back home
this a-way.</i>

222
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,553
<i>What?</i>

223
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:28,600
<i>This a-way, this</i> a-way.

224
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:33,153
<i>Lord, I can't go back home.</i>

225
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,904
<i>This a-way.</i>

226
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,411
<i>If you miss the train I'm on.</i>

227
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,705
<i>You will know that I am gone.</i>

228
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,498
Boy, they're not bad.

229
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,875
<i>You can hear the whistle blow.</i>

230
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,749
Uh-huh.

231
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,629
That Jean,

232
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,631
<i>a hundred Miles</i>

233
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,090
I'd like to fuck her.

234
00:18:54,091 --> 00:19:02,091
<i>A hundred Miles, a hundred Miles.</i>

235
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:07,687
<i>You can hear the whistle blow.</i>

236
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:12,143
<i>A hundred Miles.</i>

237
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,219
Mm.

238
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,012
Sorry.

239
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,716
It's early.
I tried not to wake anyone.

240
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,975
Mm-hm.

241
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,326
Well, that was very good.

242
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,163
What's next?

243
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,704
What do you mean?

244
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,792
Do you plug yourself in somewhere?

245
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,758
No.

246
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,977
Well,

247
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,475
report for duty.

248
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,481
Back to fort dix.

249
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,185
They making you a killing machine?

250
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,987
No, it's probably different
from what you imagine.

251
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,741
There's the discipline,
which is what you're referring to.

252
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,033
I thrive on that.

253
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,202
Weaponry is part of the job.

254
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,828
Armaments are not my thing.
I don't even approve of war toys.

255
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,662
- Is it a career?
- No, no. I get out in a few months.

256
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,461
Bud Grossman has expressed
interest in representing me.

257
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,924
Bud Grossman?

258
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,048
What's he like?

259
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,140
Mr. Grossman is a wonderful man.
He's been very supportive.

260
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,101
I played at his club in Chicago
on my last furlough,

261
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,145
right after I got
back from Germany.

262
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,813
Did you meet Elvis?

263
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,608
No. Everyone asks that.

264
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,653
No, I did not meet private Presley.

265
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,447
So you played at the gate of horn.

266
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,948
Yes.

267
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,076
Mr. Grossman liked what he saw,
I guess.

268
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,029
He thinks I can have a career.

269
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,115
Hm.

270
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,376
Thank Jim and Jean for me.

271
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,128
Mm-hm.

272
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,376
So long.

273
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,091
What's your name again?

274
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,475
Oh, shit.

275
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,268
No. No.

276
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,769
Fuck. Goddamn it. Oh, shit.

277
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,526
Fuck.

278
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,654
Shit. Cat.

279
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,336
Fuck. Kitty?

280
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,667
Fuck. Fuck.

281
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,110
Thanks for keeping quiet, asshole.

282
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,945
I'm freezing. Can we talk?

283
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,568
Not here. Fuck you.

284
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,658
I'm sorry, which?
"Out" or "fuck you"?

285
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,994
Let's go out.
Can I borrow Jim's coat?

286
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,538
<i>I don't know.</i>

287
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,584
- You don't know if it's mine?
- No. How would I know?

288
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,421
- So it could be Jim's.
- Yes, asshole.

289
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,924
Wait, you don't want it either way?
To be clear.

290
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,177
To be clear, asshole,
you fucking asshole,

291
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,973
I want very much to have it if
it's Jim's. That's what I want.

292
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,183
But since I don't know,
you not only fucked things up

293
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,227
by fucking me
and maybe making me pregnant,

294
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,187
but even if it's not yours,
I can't know that.

295
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,774
So I have to get rid of what might be
a perfectly fine baby, a baby I want,

296
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,149
because everything you
touch turns to shit.

297
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,780
Like king midas's idiot brother.

298
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,699
Well, okay.

299
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,198
I see.

300
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,660
You know a doctor, right?

301
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,998
Yes.

302
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,541
From when?

303
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,959
Whatever, Diane?

304
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,669
Yes.

305
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,964
- And you'll pay for it?
- Yes.

306
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,927
Don't tell Jim, obviously.

307
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,550
I should've had you wear
double condoms.

308
00:23:56,727 --> 00:24:00,063
Well, we shouldn't have done it in the
first place, but if you ever do it again,

309
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:03,024
which as a favor to women
everywhere, you should not,

310
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,902
but if you do, you should be wearing
condom on condom,

311
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,904
and then wrap it in
electrical tape.

312
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,782
You should just walk around always
inside a great big condom

313
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,825
- because you are shit.
- Okay.

314
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,529
You should not be in contact
with any living thing, being shit.

315
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,791
Have you ever heard the expression,
"it takes two to tango"?

316
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,084
Fuck you.

317
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,838
Well, I could say we should talk
about this when you're less angry,

318
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,341
but that would be...

319
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,385
That would be...

320
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,514
- When would that be?
- Fuck you.

321
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,314
I miss Mike.

322
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,900
Can I ask you for a favor?

323
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,691
You're joking.

324
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,322
It's not for me,
it's for the gorfeins.

325
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,778
Their cat got out. Could you leave
the fire-escape window open?

326
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,412
It's winter.

327
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,247
Just enough for the cat
to squeeze back in?

328
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,456
It could come back.

329
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,167
To our apartment?
It was there, like, six hours.

330
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,544
Why would it come back there?

331
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,587
I don't know,
I'm not a fucking cat.

332
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,174
Think about it. I lost their fucking cat.
I feel bad about it.

333
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,219
That's what you feel bad about?

334
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,653
Hello.

335
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,901
Where's your coat?

336
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,821
- It's not that cold.
- You out of your mind?

337
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,996
So how's the music going?

338
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,665
Uh, pretty good. Pretty good.

339
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,664
Oh, good. So you don't need
to borrow money.

340
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,131
- Actually, I was wondering...
- Uh-huh.

341
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,340
Is it sold?

342
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,342
- The house?
- Yeah.

343
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,136
Yeah. Uh-huh.

344
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,847
- I mean, it's in escrow.
- How much?

345
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,807
Eleven-five. But why?

346
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,560
- It's not our house.
- Not our house?

347
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,480
Well, yeah.
It's mom and dad's house.

348
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,857
Llewyn, it goes to his upkeep.
We don't get any.

349
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,065
Good thing your
music's going good.

350
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:17,075
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, well, what the fuck?

351
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,659
- Llewyn.
- What?

352
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,079
- The language.
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

353
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,372
I am not one of your
greenwich village friends.

354
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,825
Okay, yeah, yeah.

355
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,628
- You still got your seaman's papers?
- Yeah, why?

356
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:32,215
- Well, if the music's not...
- What? Quit?

357
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,839
Merchant marine again?

358
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,302
Just exist?

359
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,054
Heh, exist?

360
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,056
Is that what we do
outside of show business?

361
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,766
It's not so bad, existing.

362
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,434
- Like dad?
- Llewyn.

363
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,394
- What?
- You say that about your own father?

364
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,646
- What?
- That he exists?

365
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,524
- I didn't say... you said it. Forget it.
- That he exists? Like that?

366
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,103
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

367
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,778
- Seen him?
- Yeah.

368
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,447
What?

369
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,533
- Should I?
- You tell me, he's your father.

370
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,368
Yeah, he sure is.

371
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,539
Oh, I got... wait, I got...
You got a minute?

372
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:09,752
Well, they want me back
for rehearsals.

373
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,838
<i>Sullivan show.</i>

374
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,508
I've got autographs to sign.

375
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:18,094
- Champagne reception.
- Don't go away.

376
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,263
I cleaned it out, the house.

377
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,434
There's some stuff.
I put your stuff in a box.

378
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,432
What I thought you might want.

379
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,438
I don't know, joy.

380
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,149
Just stick it out at the curb.

381
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,026
Llewyn, are you kidding?
Look at this.

382
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,729
You know what this is?

383
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,698
This is when you recorded
"shoals of herring" for morn and dad.

384
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,868
You... whatever, you're
like 8 years old. It's so cute.

385
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:46,372
Well, see, joy, in the
entertainment business,

386
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,497
you're not supposed to let
your practice shit out.

387
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,836
It ruins the mystique.

388
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,790
I'm sorry. I don't know a lot about
the entertainment business.

389
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,170
Yeah, well...

390
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,923
Don't be sorry.

391
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,055
No, no, no, I'll bring the cat up.
It's fine. I just, uh...

392
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,309
I can't today, as it turns out.
I can't bring her today.

393
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,102
<i>- Him.</i>
- Him, him, yeah.

394
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,063
<i>- But I can get down there.</i>
- He's hanging out at Jim and Jean's.

395
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,273
He's... he likes it there.

396
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,026
- He's fine. Believe me, he's fine.
<i>- Okay. But it's easy for me...</i>

397
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,694
- No, no, no. They're not home.
<i>- Okay.</i>

398
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,654
- They're never home.
<i>- All right.</i>

399
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,656
Uh, so... anyway,
I couldn't ask you to do that.

400
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,575
All the way down to the village,
Mitch.

401
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,993
No, I'll bring her up tomorrow.

402
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,078
- Him. Him up tomorrow.
<i>- Right. Okay, good.</i>

403
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,998
<i>And remember to call Jim.
He said it was urgent.</i>

404
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,334
Yeah, I doubt if it's urgent,
but I'll call him. Thanks.

405
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,627
<i>No, no, he said it's urgent.</i>

406
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,171
<i>It's a session this
afternoon at Columbia.</i>

407
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,924
<i>Somebody got sick and dropped out.
He thought you'd like the work.</i>

408
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,509
What? What?

409
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,346
- Did he say that I need my guitar?
<i>- I think he mentioned a guitar.</i>

410
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,596
Do I need my guitar? Hello?

411
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,188
Hi, I'm here for Mr. cromartie's
session. Llewyn Davis.

412
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,642
Have a seat.
I'll let him know you're here.

413
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,776
Llewyn.

414
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,913
Mr. cromartie,
it's an honor to meet you.

415
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,374
Heh. Where's your guitar?

416
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,962
Hey.

417
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,380
- Hey, man, you made it.
- Yeah.

418
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,174
- You'll play a Gibson, right?
- Yours? Sure, yeah.

419
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,094
- You playing, uh...?
- Triple-o 21. Do you know Al Cody?

420
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,804
- Hey, man. Hey.
- Hi.

421
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,639
Can you read a chart, llewyn?

422
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,848
I, uh...

423
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,351
I can stare at a chart
and fake it, sir.

424
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,229
All right.
Jim and Al will teach you the song.

425
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,897
Take your time.
We're here to have fun.

426
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,232
All right.

427
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,692
So we're, uh...?

428
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,443
We're the what?
The John Glenn singers?

429
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,363
It's not the most serious music
we've recorded at this studio.

430
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,864
Uh...

431
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,408
It's a thing.

432
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,454
<i>I don't wanna
don't send me off into outer space.</i>

433
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,914
<i>I sweat when they put me.</i>

434
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,001
Yeah, but we wanna go to... let's still
do the "p-p-please" into the...

435
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,377
- Into the verse.
- Really?

436
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,586
- Yeah.
- P-p-p.

437
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,256
<i>Don't send me off into outer...
P-p-p-p-please.</i>

438
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,509
What? No, I ca... because then it gets
all muddled up into the verse.

439
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,885
- No, no, no.
- Shoot.

440
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,513
No, you just do the p-p-p's
into the ver... if you do two p-p's.

441
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,849
- P-p, then the "sweat when they..."
- Yep.

442
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,347
- Really?
- Yep.

443
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,602
<i>P-p, I sweat when they stuck me.</i>

444
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,979
<i>In the pressure suit.</i>

445
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,230
Shoot.

<i>Bubble helmet

447
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,695
<i>- No air out there, gravity...
- Ow, ow, ow.</i>

448
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,905
<i>- That's no place to be a hero.
- Shoot.</i>

449
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,280
- Okay.
- Yeah. Oh-oh-oh.

450
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,578
Okay.

451
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,200
Hey, look, I'm happy for the gig,
but who wrote this?

452
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,376
I did.

453
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,080
- You...
- Okay?

454
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,131
So okay?

455
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,425
- Good?
- Shoot.

456
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:48,262
"Please, Mr. Kennedy"
take one. And we're rolling.

457
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,974

512
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,817
I'll need a permission.
He'll give you one.

513
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,152
- See you.
- Uh...

514
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,029
That's gonna take...

515
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,857
Shit, man, I need the money now.

516
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,949
You wanna just be
an independent contractor,

517
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,701
accounting will give you
a check today.

518
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,454
Just bill us for services, $200.
That's more than a session fee

519
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,540
- because you don't get royalties.
- Okay, that's fine. And I can cash it?

520
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,958
Sure, right around the corner.

521
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,586
But you don't go on a session
sheet then, <i>so</i> no royalties.

522
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,506
That's okay, that's fine.
Hey, where do you live, Al?

523
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,380
- Downing street.
- Yeah, nice place?

524
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,180
- It's a dump.
- Uh-huh. Got a couch?

525
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,483
- Where's Mel?
- Mel's at a funeral.

526
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,193
Boy, that man goes
to a lot of funerals.

527
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,654
- He likes people.
- Fewer and fewer.

528
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,905
This is family.

529
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:56,534
His nephew, Georgie, is engaged
to a girl whose mother just passed.

530
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,868
I don't know if that's family.

531
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,496
He likes funerals.
I don't know what to tell you.

532
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,416
I forgot to pick up my mail yesterday.
I was so pissed at Mel.

533
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,168
You didn't forget
to pick up your mail.

534
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,542
- Yeah, I did.
- You don't have any mail.

535
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,624
Oh.

536
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,842
Shit.

537
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,427
I didn't get anything
from bud Grossman in Chicago?

538
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,638
You were supposed to get something
from bud Grossman?

539
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,057
Yeah, I had Mel send him
my solo record when it came out.

540
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,636
- Whenever, more than a month ago.
- Oh.

541
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,521
No, you didn't get anything.

542
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,357
But we were making space
in the stock room

543
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,277
and dumped the rest
of the old records.

544
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,152
All the remainders.

545
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,990
Yours and Mikey's.

546
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,789
Mel set one box aside.

547
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,960
Thought you might wanna
keep some copies.

548
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,838
What am I gonna do with them?

549
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,882
Should I throw them out?

550
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,514
- Oh, good.
- Hey.

551
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,349
Here's a key.

552
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,060
Just going out to Jersey
to pick up my mom's car.

553
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:08,105
- Okay. Oh! Sorry. Okay.
- Ha-ha-ha.

554
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,704
Mm-hm.

555
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,038
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Hey, it's me, llewyn.

556
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,540
- Yeah?
- Can I come up?

557
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,584
No.

558
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,128
Okay.

559
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,626
Well...

560
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,882
Well, can I have my stuff?

561
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,256
<i>I'll bring it down.
I'll meet you at the Reggie.</i>

562
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,891
Hey.

563
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,765
Thank you.

564
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,682
- Who won the lottery tonight?
- Huh?

565
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,778
Oh. I'm staying at Al Cody's.

566
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,198
So when do you wanna do the...?

567
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,242
- Have the...?
- The abortion?

568
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,369
The sooner the better.

569
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,122
Okay. I'll see when
the guy can do it then.

570
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,958
"The guy"? I hope it's a doctor.

571
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,751
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's a doctor.

572
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,462
- You got the money?
- Yes, I have the money, don't worry.

573
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,506
- With you, I worry.
- Well, you shouldn't.

574
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,049
Yes, I should.

575
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,509
God knows you never do.

576
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,345
You just let other people,
like your method of birth control.

577
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,764
Oh, please don't start
with the double condoms again.

578
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,593
Do you ever think
about the future at all?

579
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,353
The future?

580
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,564
You mean, like flying cars?

581
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,774
Hotels on the moon?

582
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,776
- Tang?
- And this is why you're fucked.

583
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,486
No, it's why you're fucked.

584
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,281
You're just trying
to blueprint a future.

585
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,284
Move to the suburbs with Jim,
have kids.

586
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,536
- That's bad?
- If that's what music is for you,

587
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,873
a way to get to that place,
then, yeah, it's a little careerist,

588
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,247
and it's a little square,

589
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,211
- and it's a little sad.
- I'm sad?

590
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,172
You're the one who's
not getting anywhere.

591
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,340
You don't wanna get anywhere.
Me and Jim try.

592
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,670
- I do. I wanna...
- We try, you sleep on the couch.

593
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,347
- That's a bad thing to throw in my face.
- You don't wanna go anywhere.

594
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,850
That's why all the same shit
is gonna keep happening to you,

595
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,560
- because you want it to.
- Is that why?

596
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,896
Yes, and also because
you're an asshole

597
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,774
who sleeps with other people's women.
Let's not forget that.

598
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,984
You're being pretty kind
to yourself now, aren't you?

599
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,485
- Whose couch are you on tonight?
- I told you. Al Cody's. You don't listen.

600
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:06,241
You just spout vitriol.

601
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,444
Keep an eye on my shit.

602
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,590
Hey.

603
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:25,011
Hey. Hey, hey.

604
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:36,227
Oh, goddamn it.
I am one lucky bastard.

605
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,309
Thanks for suggesting this place.

606
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,444
Poor thing couldn't have eaten
since yesterday.

607
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,446
It's a damn house cat.
There you go.

608
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,574
You know its name?
I can't remember his name.

609
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,409
I don't know its name.

610
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,078
I don't hang out with the gorfeins.

611
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,407
Oh, good kitty.
Jesus, thank God.

612
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,250
Well, where were we?

613
00:38:56,251 --> 00:39:00,126
You were calling me a careerist,
and I was calling you a loser.

614
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,673
Right, well,
those are your categories.

615
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,341
No, those are your categories.

616
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,884
You know, in my experience,

617
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,095
the world's divided
into two kinds of people.

618
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,305
Those who divide the world
into two kinds of people...

619
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,553
And losers?

620
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,771
- Hey.
- Hey.

621
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,482
Uh, can you bring this up for me?
This ain't a spot.

622
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,402
- I just brought some stuff from home.
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

623
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,863
Hey, you don't need to... meow.

624
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,407
You don't need to crash for more
than a couple days, do you?

625
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,576
My girlfriend's coming down
from Boston on Tuesday.

626
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:34,079
Uh... yeah, no, that's... yeah,
it's fine. That's okay. Yeah, thanks.

627
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,164
You don't wanna go to Chicago,
do you?

628
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,501
- Why would I wanna go to Chicago?
- Yeah. Ha, ha.

629
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,462
This car's going to Chicago Tuesday.
A friend of mine is taking someone

630
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,173
to a gig and they're looking
for someone to help pay for gas.

631
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,591
I prefer New York.

632
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,011
Who's "Arthur milgram"?

633
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,596
Oh, that's me.

634
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,016
I'm gonna change it legally,
at some point.

635
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,196
Mr. Davis?

636
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,991
No, no, no, she
won't want me with her.

637
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,993
Oh, okay. Well, she should
have a friend though.

638
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,328
Someone who can help her home.

639
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,456
- Okay, I'll let her know.
- It'll have to be on a Saturday.

640
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,207
Hey, I could do it this Saturday.

641
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,878
Okay. I'll, uh, pay you now
since I won't see you. Cash.

642
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,457
Oh! No, no, no. Heh.

643
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,008
- No charge.
- Huh?

644
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,632
You know, from last time.

645
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,680
From last time? You mean Diane?

646
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,433
Yeah, I didn't have a number
or an address for you.

647
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,102
- Where do you live anyway?
- Wait, what?

648
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,438
- I didn't have a...
- Why...?

649
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,267
- Why is there no charge this time?
- Huh?

650
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,276
Why...?

651
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,570
Well, you know.

652
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,864
Well, no, I don't know, man.
You working pro Bono now?

653
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,568
Well, no, since it didn't
happen last time.

654
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,825
What didn't happen?

655
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,288
Diane didn't tell you?

656
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,006
Diane did not terminate
the pregnancy.

657
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,511
She came in to tell me she decided

658
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,470
to go to term.

659
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,799
She didn't tell you?

660
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,676
Uh, no.

661
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,728
She, uh...

662
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,690
Geez, she asked me to refer her
to a doctor in akron.

663
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,895
- In akron?
- To deliver the, uh...

664
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,115
No, I knew she was, uh, going
to akron. She's from akron.

665
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,909
Yes.

666
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,492
- I'm sorry, I thought...
- Her parents are in akron.

667
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,876
The kid would be about 2 now?

668
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,170
Yeah, I guess.

669
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,623
Yes.

670
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,342
I'm sorry, I didn't know how
to get the money back to you.

671
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,966
I never see you at
the hoots anymore.

672
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,329
- Oh, there's the cat.
- Yeah.

673
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,540
Home from the hill.
Hey, llewyn, welcome. Come on in.

674
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,126
Lillian's in the kitchen.
She's making her famous moussaka.

675
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,295
No, I can't barge in for dinner.
I just wanted to...

676
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,465
- No, no. Come on. One more person?
- No, no, no. No, I can't.

677
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:34,134
Moussaka? Come on.

678
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:37,805
Do you know, uh...? You know
Marty green and Janet fung?

679
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,140
Hello, nice to meet you.
Llewyn Davis.

680
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,559
Oh, uh, Mitch and Lillian's, uh,
folk song friend.

681
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,769
You crashing with us?

682
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,229
Oh, no, no, no.
I hadn't even planned on dinner.

683
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,149
Llewyn's not an upper West Side guy.
We only get to see him when...

684
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,068
When I've rotated through
my village friends.

685
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,070
Yeah, we're the last resort.

686
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,572
Marty's in my department.
And, uh, Joe's a musician.

687
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,784
This is Joe flom. He plays in
musica anticha with Lillian.

688
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:01,703
Oh, hello. How you doing?

689
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,123
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

690
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,458
What's your instrument?

691
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:10,378
Well, anything with a keyboard.
I play Celeste and harpsichord in ma.

692
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,506
I'm a piano instructor most days.

693
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,299
- Hey, bum a cigarette?
- Oh, sure.

694
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,926
Glass of wine, llewyn?

695
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,674
- A little dago red?
- Yeah.

696
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,555
I should've brought something.

697
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,390
Hey, don't be silly,
you brought the cat.

698
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,725
Yeah, right.

699
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,724
You know, uh,

700
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,023
I used to, uh, take piano lessons
when I was a kid

701
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,773
from, uh, Mrs. sieglestein.

702
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,356
You don't know
Mrs. sieglestein, do you?

703
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:41,701
Very, very big calves,
orthopedic shoes,

704
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,576
lives in far rockaway,
upstairs from the kurlands?

705
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,584
Does she play early music?

706
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,920
Um...

707
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,381
Harry James on the radio.

708
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:57,005
On the piano, um,

709
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,929
"drink to me only with thine eyes."

710
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,389
Uh-huh.

711
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,765
She was not a swinger.

712
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,101
Well, Harry James.

713
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:09,431
Okay, yeah, well, her playing that
was pretty on the beat.

714
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,729
He's adorable.

715
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,779
- How old is he?
- Just turned 2 in April.

716
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,156
He's with my mother now.

717
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,991
Grandmas come in handy, right?

718
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,076
- What's his name?
- Howie.

719
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,453
He already calls him Howie.
It's Howard.

720
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,281
Howie greenfung.

721
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,084
What? Like...?

722
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,836
Like, "green-fung"? Hyphenated?

723
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,754
No, no, one word, greenfung.

724
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,628
Howard greenfung.

725
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,590
You're kidding, right?

726
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,554
- No.
- Llewyn, why don't you...?

727
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:43,972
Why don't you give us a song?

728
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,349
Oh, yes, please. He's very good.

729
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,726
- Joe should hear you.
- No.

730
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:50,061
- And Marty and Janet.
- Of course.

731
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:53,148
I'm getting my silvertone. You get
to play it if and only if you sing.

732
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:56,484
Right, yeah, okay, I can tell this is one
of those things where I keep saying no

733
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,445
and you think I'm just asking you
to beg more.

734
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,280
Yeah, that's right.

735
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,240
Hey, look,
I'm not a trained poodle.

736
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:06,036
I thought singing was a
joyous expression of the soul.

737
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,580
Yeah.

738
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,960
All right. Um...

739
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,217
This is...

740
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,099
This one's early.
Joe should like it.

741
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:38,360
<i>If I had wings.</i>

742
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:41,529
<i>Like norah's dove.</i>

743
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,483
<i>I'd fly up the river.</i>

744
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:50,121
<i>To the one I love.</i>

745
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:54,584
<i>- Fare thee well.
- Well.</i>

746
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,419
- Oh, honey...
- Oh, honey...

747
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,129
- What are you doing?
- What?

748
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,839
What is that?
What are you doing?

749
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,089
- Well, it's Mike's part.
- Don't do that.

750
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:07,473
- It's Mike's part.
- I know what it is. Don't do that.

751
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,606
Oh, you know what?
This is bullshit.

752
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,900
I'm sorry, this is...
I don't do this, okay?

753
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,988
I do this for a living. It's not a...
It's not a fucking parlor game.

754
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,156
Llewyn, please,
that's unfair to Lillian.

755
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,242
This is bullshit.
I don't ask you over for dinner

756
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:30,245
and then suggest you give a lecture
on the peoples of mesoamerica.

757
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,039
Or whatever your
pre-columbian shit is.

758
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,750
This is my job. This is how
I pay the fucking rent.

759
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,419
Llewyn, that's not...

760
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,878
This is a loving home.

761
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,839
I'm a fucking professional.
And you know what?

762
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,417
- Fuck Mike's part!
- Ah!

763
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,135
- It's okay, Lillian.
- This is just a... this is...

764
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,805
I can't stay in this room.
I can't stay in this room.

765
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,936
Well, she...

766
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,016
She doesn't have to leave.
I'm leaving, obviously.

767
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,478
Sorry I fucked up your evening.

768
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,109
- Thank you for the moussaka.
- Aah!

769
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,324
This is not our cat.

770
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,331
What? Of course that's your cat.

771
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,035
- Oh, my God.
- It's not even male.

772
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,295
Where's its scrotum, llewyn?

773
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:23,796
- Wh... it's...
- Where's its scrotum?

774
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,532
My stuff.

775
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,646
Hello.

776
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,320
Yeah, hey.

777
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,814
What's this?

778
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,562
It's my guitar.

779
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:08,278
Sure, move in. Don't mind me.

780
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,197
Make yourself at home.

781
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,407
What are you, a flamenco dancer?

782
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:20,787
What's your name? Pablo?

783
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,372
Llewyn Davis.

784
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,588
I am roland Turner.

785
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:29,759
This is my valet, Johnny five.

786
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,630
Johnny five.

787
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,684
And that was the last time
I was in murfreesboro.

788
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,437
Gave me to understand
I would not be welcome back.

789
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,148
I said, "that's okay, brother.
I might have managed on my own"

790
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:50,150
not to make it back to your
little flyspeck horseshit town."

791
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,106
What the n stand for?

792
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:56,576
- What?
- What's the n stand for?

793
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,204
- Lou n. Davis.
- "Llewyn."

794
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:02,124
Llewyn, l-l-e-w-y-n. It's welsh.

795
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,543
Well, it would have to be something,
stupid fucking name like that.

796
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,629
- You don't look welsh-
- my mother was Italian...

797
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,963
Here, this would interest you.

798
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:12,091
Johnny and I were in Seattle
playing the high spot.

799
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,301
Remember this, Johnny?

800
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:17,555
And I became indisposed after eating
a toasted cheese sandwich,

801
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,975
and found myself purging
from every orifice,

802
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,936
one of them like a fire hose.

803
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,606
I said to the manager:

804
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,650
"What do you call that thing
I just ate?"

805
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:32,237
He said, "welsh rarebit."

806
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:36,032
I says, "okay, does everything
from wales make you shit yourself",

807
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,576
or just this piece of toast?"

808
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,411
He said... holy Jesus.
What is that thing?

809
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,122
It's... it's my cat.
Well, it's not my cat, it's...

810
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,083
Grown man with a cat.

811
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,460
- Is that part of your act?
- No.

812
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,171
- What'd you say you played?
- Folk songs.

813
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,925
Folk songs. Thought you said
you were a musician.

814
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,970
Folk singer with a cat.
You queer?

815
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:00,431
L... it's not my cat.
I just didn't know what to do with it.

816
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,726
Really? So did you bring
your dick along too?

817
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,104
Johnny, hold up.

818
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,558
There's a service station.

819
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,898
Your turn to pay for gas, elwin.

820
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,040
He still in there?

821
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,287
You're a friend of Al's?

822
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,920
Yeah.

823
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:34,359
<i>When I go back Baltimore.</i>

824
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,695
<i>Need no carpet on my floor.</i>

825
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,399
<i>Come along and follow me.</i>

826
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:44,403
<i>We'll go down to galilee.</i>

827
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,371
Everybody.

828
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:49,499
<i>Green, green, rocky road.</i>

829
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,708
Yeah.

830
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,877
<i>Promenade in green.</i>

831
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,796
Mm-hm.

832
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:58,966
<i>Tell me who you love
tell me who you love.</i>

833
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,760
Nice.

834
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:18,111
There was a sign that said,
"no massé shots, no coins on cloth."

835
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:22,949
I said, "am I allowed to bank the ball
off the cushions or is that too fancy?"

836
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,953
The guy says, "you're a hustler."
I say, "you're a fucking idiot.

837
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,622
A hustler pretends
he's out of his depth.

838
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,625
I'm telling you I'm an adept.
Maybe you're the hustler

839
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:36,456
"pretending to be a lunkhead.
Got me fooled."

840
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:40,007
"No massé shots, no
coins on cloth."

841
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,010
Don't give me rules.
You play what you play.

842
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,639
Well, you don't, but in jazz,
you know, we play all the notes.

843
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,728
Twelve notes in a scale, dipshit,
not three chords on a ukulele.

844
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:55,606
<i>G, g, c, g.</i>

845
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:59,152
<i>C, d, g.</i>

846
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:02,448
Well, if you make a living at it,
more power to you.

847
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,824
Solo act?

848
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,243
- Yeah, now.
- Now?

849
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,620
Used to, what, work with the cat?

850
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,790
Every time you play a c major,
he'd puke a hair ball?

851
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,584
I used to have a partner.

852
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,708
What happened?

853
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,837
He threw himself off
the George Washington bridge.

854
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,343
Well, shit, I don't blame him.

855
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,972
I couldn't take it either, having to play
"Jimmy cracked corn" every night.

856
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,933
Oh, pardon me for saying so, that's
pretty fucking stupid, isn't it?

857
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,060
George Washington bridge?

858
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:37,023
You throw yourself off
the Brooklyn bridge, traditionally.

859
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,983
George Washington bridge?

860
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,860
Who does that?

861
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,359
What was he, a dumbbell?

862
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,696
Not really.

863
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,202
And that's when
you picked up the cat?

864
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:52,622
Here, cowboy chords,
this would interest you.

865
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,082
There's this act I saw
in montreux, Switzerland.

866
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,503
- A bass, a piano and a sound tree...
- Hey, Mr. Turner, I'm wondering.

867
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,254
- Huh?
- Would that cane

868
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,923
fit all the way up your ass

869
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,468
or would a little bit
stay sticking out?

870
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,178
Okay.

871
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,051
Okay.

872
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,521
Except threats and intimidation
won't work with me.

873
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,898
You wanna know why?
This would interest you.

874
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,775
I studied santeria

875
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:24,153
and certain other things that squares
like you would call the black arts

876
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,865
due to lack of understanding,
from chano pozo in new Orleans.

877
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,242
You say you'll mess me up?

878
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:31,536
I don't have to make
those childish threats.

879
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:34,372
I do my thing, and one day
you wake up wondering:

880
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,958
"Why do I have this
pain in my side?"

881
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,044
Or maybe it won't
even be that specific.

882
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,797
Maybe it's, "why is
nothing going right for me?"

883
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,300
My life is a big bowl of shit.

884
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:50,176
"I don't remember making
this big bowl of shit."

885
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:55,768
Meantime, roland Turner
is a thousand Miles away,

886
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,813
laughing his ass off.

887
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,017
Think about that, elwin.

888
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:06,064
In this car,
bad manners won't work.

889
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,167
Bum a cigarette?

890
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,625
I'm out.

891
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,193
"Clean asshole poems,."

892
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,870
Orlovsky.

893
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,290
Then,

894
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,493
acted.

895
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,336
<i>The brig.</i>

896
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,678
Three weeks on that show.

897
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,847
Could've been more.

898
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,722
Cops closed it.

899
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,729
How come?

900
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,022
Long story.

901
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:46,337
<i>"'More, more, more, 'cried the bed."</i>

902
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,916
<i>'Talk to me more.'.</i>

903
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:52,628
<i>Oh, bed that faked
the weight of the world.</i>

904
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,344
<i>All the lost dreams laid on you.</i>

905
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,350
<i>Oh, bed that grows no hair.</i>

906
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:01,770
<i>That cannot be fucked,</i>

907
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,356
<i>or can be fucked.</i>

908
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,486
<i>Oh, bed crumbs of all ages
spilled on you.</i>

909
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,820
<i>Oh, bed.</i>

910
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,537
Yes.

911
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,668
Well...

912
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,833
Excuse me.

913
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,443
Hi.

914
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,194
How far are we from Chicago?

915
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,899
About three hours,
a little more with the weather.

916
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,006
Should I go call an ambulance?

917
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,340
No, he's all right.

918
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,727
Grab his sticks.

919
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,035
What are you doing?

920
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,534
- I'm just, uh...
- You can't stop here.

921
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,833
I just pulled over to
rest a little bit.

922
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,586
You inebriated?

923
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:16,085
- He's not drunk.
- I wasn't talking to you.

924
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:19,049
You, get out of the car.

925
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,924
- Me?
- You. Out of the car.

926
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,434
Come here, I want you to walk...

927
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:31,388
- Hands off the merchandise.
- Don't play games, kid.

928
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,899
Son of a bitch.

929
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,400
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

930
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,487
I've been in your jails.
That's not gonna work.

931
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,790
Shit.

932
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,962
Oh, sh...

933
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,022
Number two.

934
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,286
- More coffee?
- Yeah.

935
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:09,072
We're switching over.
Could you pay the ticket?

936
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,249
What train are you waiting for?

937
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,469
Hello?

938
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:17,970
Hello?

939
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,764
Is bud Grossman here?

940
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,845
Isn't in yet.

941
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,940
Can I wait here?

942
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:30,896
Uh, sure. Maybe an hour.

943
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:51,917
<i>Cocaine runnin' all
around my brain.</i>

944
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,609
Mr. Grossman.

945
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:14,030
Yeah?

946
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:17,776
I, uh... I'm llewyn Davis.

947
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,620
Uh-huh.

948
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:25,451
- I'm sorry, do you know me?
- No.

949
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,169
Um, Mel novikoff sent you my
record about a month ago.

950
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,672
<i>- Inside llewyn Davis.</i>
- Oh, you're with Mel.

951
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:36,426
Yeah, yeah, I was, uh, just in Chicago,
just, uh... just passing through.

952
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,174
Um...

953
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:41,557
- You like the record?
- Don't know. I didn't get it.

954
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,599
Well, um,

955
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,814
here it is. Uh, it's...

956
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,562
This is it anyway, it's...

01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,694
That'll be $5.

958
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,907
I was joking.

959
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,073
Uh-huh.

960
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,041
Well, yeah, I'm, um...

961
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,377
I'm interested in gigging here,

962
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:13,797
but, um, maybe also
in obtaining management.

963
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:15,507
Uh-huh.

964
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,301
You getting any money out of Mel?

965
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,551
- Not...
- Yeah, I bet.

966
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,309
Okay, let's hear something.

967
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,768
You don't wanna hear the record?

968
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,146
Why should I? You're here.
Play me something.

969
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:30,394

Not here.

973
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,444
Okay.

Okay.

997
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:15,956
Okay. So that's it?

998
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,875
You're okay. You're not green.

999
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:21,920
But I don't have what,
say, Troy Nelson has?

1000
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,714
You know Troy?

1001
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,750
Good kid.

1002
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,627
He's a good kid.

1003
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,428
Yeah.

1004
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,676
He connects with people.

1005
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:37,269
Look, I'm putting together a trio.
Two guys and a girl singer.

1006
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,687
You're no front guy,

1007
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,897
but if you can cut that
down to a goatee,

1008
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,399
and stay out of the sun,

1009
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,860
we might see how your voice works
with the other two.

1010
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,736
You comfortable with harmonies?

1011
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,280
No.

1012
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,408
Yes. But, um, no.

1013
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,326
No, I had a partner.

1014
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:56,155
Uh-huh. Well, that makes sense.

1015
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,206
My suggestion?

1016
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,786
Get back together.

1017
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,924
That's good advice.

1018
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,087
Thank you, Mr. Grossman.

1019
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:29,946
- Where you going?
- New York.

1020
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:32,991
Man, that's great. I'm going home
to New Jersey. I've not slept.

1021
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,910
- You drive, right?
- Yeah.

1022
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,786
Well, as long as you drive
and let me sleep,

1023
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,663
we can do it all the way, man.

1024
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,083
Oh, sh...

1025
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:23,468
So, uh, can I ship out?

1026
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,224
No, you cannot.

1027
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:29,679
- Why?
- You're not on the roster.

1028
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,897
Okay. Well, can you put
me on the roster?

1029
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,399
No, I cannot.

1030
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,276
- Why?
- Why you think?

1031
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:38,946
I don't know.
Because I'm a communist.

1032
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,606
- Shachtmanite?
- What?

1033
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:43,199
No, you ain't that.
You ain't, uh...

1034
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,076
- You ain't current.
- I'm not current?

1035
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,662
- That's another way of putting it.
- Is that a nautical term?

1036
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,372
You ain't current on your dues.

1037
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:52,250
You pay your dues, arrears,
148 bucks,

1038
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:55,003
you go back on the roster
and I can ship you out.

1039
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,630
<i>There's a post on the maid
of the gate, seaman first class.</i>

1040
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,004
She weighs anchor
this Friday, 6 P.M.

1041
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,469
The money, what I owe, can't they just
take it out of, whatever, the first week?

1042
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,805
I can't run out on it.
I'm in your fucking sardine can.

1043
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:09,431
Yeah, they don't do that.
You gotta be current to ship out.

1044
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,772
Wow.

1045
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,569
I just make it.
I'm leaving naked, man.

1046
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:22,322
- Clean start. Okay. Can I pay you?
- Mm-hm.

1047
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,782
Now, I will write you a receipt,

1048
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:29,370
along with the, uh, pier, ship number,
and the time.

1049
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,539
Got your masters mate's
and pilot's license, right?

1050
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,334
- You ain't shipping out without that.
- Yeah, I got it.

1051
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,044
There you go, llewyn Davis.

1052
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,918
Hey, you're not Hugh
Davis's kid, are you?

1053
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,341
Why not?

1054
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,566
Hey...

1055
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,280
How's it going?

1056
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,042
I'm taking off, pop.

1057
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:18,496
Won't see you for a while.

1058
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:22,712
Shipping out.

1059
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:30,807
Try something new.

1060
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:34,053
I mean something old.

1061
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,727
Okay.

1062
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:54,870
Here's this. You used to like this.

1063
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:11,387
<i>Oh, it was a fine
and a pleasant day.</i>

1064
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:18,648
<i>Out of yarmouth harbor
I was faring.</i>

1065
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:26,280
<i>As a cabin boy
on a sailing lugger.</i>

1066
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:33,618
<i>For to hunt
the bonny shoals of herring.</i>

1067
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,709
<i>Now you're up on deck.</i>

1068
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:43,335
<i>You're a fisherman.</i>

1069
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:50,805
<i>You can swear
and show a manly bearing.</i>

1070
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:58,267
<i>Take your turn and watch
with the other fellas.</i>

1071
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:05,270
<i>As you hunt
the bonny shoals of herring.</i>

1072
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:15,204
<i>Well, I earned my keep
and I paid my way.</i>

1073
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:22,502
<i>And I earned the gear
that I was wearing.</i>

1074
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:25,963
<i>I sailed a million Miles.</i>

1075
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:30,009
<i>Caught 10 million fishes.</i>

1076
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:35,098
<i>We were dreaming of the shoals.</i>

1077
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:38,428
<i>Of herring.</i>

1078
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:47,604
<i>Night and day
the seas we're Darin'.</i>

1079
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:53,658
<i>Come wind or calm.</i>

1080
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:57,864
<i>Or winter Gale.</i>

1081
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:02,998
<i>Sweating or cold.</i>

1082
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:08,548
<i>Growing up, growing old.</i>

1083
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:11,548
<i>Or dying.</i>

1084
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,640
<i>As we dream about the shoals.</i>

1085
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:22,187
<i>Of herring.</i>

1086
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,028
Wow.

1087
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,082
Wow.

1088
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,177
Excuse me?

1089
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:57,552
Could I trouble you?
My father had, um...

1090
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,682
He needs to be cleaned.

1091
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,852
How is he?

1092
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,896
He's great.

1093
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:06,981
Good to see what I have
to look forward to.

1094
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,229
What?

1095
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:10,318
- Llewyn.
- No, I'm not kidding.

1096
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,986
I got it all figured out now.

1097
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:15,990
You put in some hard years, yeah,
but eventually you get to kick back,

1098
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:19,452
your food's brought to you,
don't even have to get up to shit.

1099
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:22,705
- Llewyn, Danny's sitting right here.
- Oh, sorry.

1100
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:24,999
What's wrong with you?
Shame on you.

1101
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,960
I'm sorry. It was really good
to see him. It was great.

1102
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,414
- Where'd you put my file box?
- Huh?

1103
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:32,715
From the house,
where's my file box?

1104
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,634
You told me to throw
everything out.

1105
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:36,093
All the old shit, joy.

1106
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,346
- Fuck, you threw out my file box?
- Llewyn.

1107
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:41,349
Yeah, no cursing. Except now I gotta
go back to the fucking union hall.

1108
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,601
It had my masters mate's
and pilot's license in it.

1109
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,102
Jesus Christ, joy.

1110
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:46,854
You told me to put
it out by the curb.

1111
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,147
It's what I did.

1112
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,358
I want you to leave.
Get out of here.

1113
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,606
Fuck.

1114
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:56,653
- Yeah, I'm a dick, right?
- That's right.

1115
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:01,285
Danny, your Uncle's a bad man.

1116
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,113
Okay.

1117
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,419
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's llewyn. Don't hang up.

1118
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,130
I don't wanna stay. I just need
a place to dump my stuff. Please.

1119
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:16,130
I'm tired of dragging it
all around with me.

1120
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,378
Please?

1121
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:38,114
- Where are you gonna stay?
- I don't know.

1122
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,323
It's only two nights.

1123
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:43,154
There must be someone in the
five boroughs who isn't pissed at me.

1124
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,414
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

1125
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:47,662
Why?

1126
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:50,752
So it went okay?

1127
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:53,296
I'm doing it Saturday.

1128
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:56,674
Jesus, llewyn,
you don't even fucking remember.

1129
01:24:56,675 --> 01:25:00,595
Yeah, boy, I'm sorry.
I... I was away.

1130
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:03,931
Well, it seemed like it was a long time,
but it was just a couple of days. Yeah.

1131
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,392
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Where were you?

1132
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:08,436
In Chicago.

1133
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,767
Why?

1134
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,516
No. Nothing.

1135
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,438
Pappi will let you play tomorrow.

1136
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,696
Pick up a couple bucks.

1137
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,698
No, he won't.
I was there less than a month ago.

1138
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,366
He will. I asked him.

1139
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:26,663
Wow. Thank you,
that was very nice of you,

1140
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:30,326
but I'm out. I'm done.

1141
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:33,711
- Going back to the merchant marine.
- What, that's it?

1142
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:35,630
This could be good for you
tomorrow.

1143
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,757
Playing the gaslight
for the 400th time?

1144
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,175
For the fucking basket?

1145
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,802
Actually,
you'd have to split the basket.

1146
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:43,721
- Heh.
- There's another act.

1147
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,806
But <i>the times</i> is gonna be there.

1148
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,554
Oh, <i>the times.</i>

1149
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:50,061
I'm sorry.

1150
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,973
I'm sorry. Thanks for the thought,

1151
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,108
but it's not going anywhere.

1152
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,483
I'm tired.

1153
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:00,772
You're tired?

1154
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:04,576
Yeah, I'm so fucking tired.

1155
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:08,371
I thought I just needed a
night's sleep, but it's...

1156
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:11,074
It's more than that.

1157
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:16,463
But thank you, for trying.

1158
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,415
I love you.

1159
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,674
Come on.

1160
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:26,055
Are you shitting me?

1161
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:28,224
In what way, buddy?

1162
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:31,227
Eighty-five dollars?
To replace a license?

1163
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:33,354
You don't throw out the license.

1164
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,564
That's the one thing you keep.

1165
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:37,312
I can't... where am I gonna...?

1166
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:40,319
Fuck.

1167
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,114
All right, well, let me get
this money back then.

1168
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:45,529
I got...

1169
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,911
I kept this fucking thing.

1170
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:52,415
I just paid my dues this morning,
148 bucks. There's the receipt.

1171
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,118
You don't...

1172
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:57,166
We don't pay dues back.
What are you, nuts?

1173
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,881
I just paid it this morning.
That was four hours ago.

1174
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,591
- Yeah.
- Come on, you're telling me...

1175
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:05,219
I can't crew the ship,
and I can't get this money back?

1176
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,680
This was money
you owed your union.

1177
01:27:07,681 --> 01:27:10,430
You Hugh Davis's kid?

1178
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,476
- Yeah.
- How's he doing?

1179
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:15,104
He's fucking great. Matter of fact,
he's been asking after you.

1180
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:19,358
<i>A hungry feelin'.</i>

1181
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,904
<i>Came o'er me stealin'.</i>

1182
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:28,701
<i>And the mice were squealin'.</i>

1183
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:32,621
<i>In my prison cell.</i>

1184
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:37,585
<i>And the auld triangle.</i>

1185
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:42,798
<i>Went jingle jangle.</i>

1186
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:48,387
<i>All along the banks.</i>

1187
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:54,268
<i>Of the royal canal.</i>

1188
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:58,522
<i>To begin the morning.</i>

1189
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:02,526
<i>A screw was bawlin'.</i>

1190
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,236
<i>Get up...</i>

1191
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:06,064
Hey.

1192
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:09,151
We're gonna hear you tomorrow.

1193
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:12,238
Yeah, I guess you are.

1194
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,949
Well, you're welcome.

1195
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:20,002
What do you think of these guys?

1196
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:24,048
<i>All along the banks.</i>

1197
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:28,803
<i>Of the royal canal</i>

1198
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,221
I like the sweaters.

1199
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:33,676
<i>The lads were sleepin'.</i>

1200
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:38,730
You know, you wouldn't
fucking believe the rent here.

1201
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:42,233
This folk shit, I don't know.

1202
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:45,694
Jim and Jean,
we get a good crowd.

1203
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:47,442
You know why, llewyn?

1204
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:49,156
Lot of these guys,

01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:52,201
a lot them come in here
catch the act,

1206
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:54,453
because they wanna fuck Jean.

1207
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,330
That's why they come in.

1208
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:59,166
And some of them,
some of these guys, llewyn,

1209
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,961
they come in here
because they wanna fuck Jim.

1210
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:06,799
They wanna fuck Jim.

1211
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,717
Know what I mean?

1212
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:11,887
- You mean they wanna fuck Jim.
- Exactly.

1213
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,307
Exactly.

1214
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,770
Well, me,

1215
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:21,393
I've only fucked Jean.

1216
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:24,900
<i>All along the banks.</i>

1217
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,227
What?

1218
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:27,987
Oh, yeah.

1219
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,361
Oh, yeah. You know.

1220
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,409
If you wanna play the gaslight...

1221
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:37,246
Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks.

1222
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:40,416
- Thanks.
- Thank you, pappi corsicato.

1223
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:43,836
Please give a great big

01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:46,790
from elinora in Arkansas.

1225

Thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1226
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,264
Thank you. You're so nice.

1227
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:57,182
This is my first show in New York.

1228
01:29:57,183 --> 01:30:00,011
How'd you get the gig, Betty?

1229
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,348
Um, I'm gonna do this song.

1230
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,317
It's like a lot of the songs I do.

1231
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:08,360
It's one I grew up with.

1232
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:11,363
Ha, ha. Come on, llewyn.
Give me a little credit.

1233
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:16,744
<i>I'm a-goin' away
to leave you, love.</i>

1234
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:22,167
<i>I'm going far over the sea.</i>

1235
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:28,047
<i>But I'll return to you someday.</i>

1236
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:29,256
<i>So I go 10,000 Miles.</i>

1237
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:32,631
- Where's your hay bale?
- Shh!

1238
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:35,512
<i>The storms are on.</i>

1239
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:37,681
Huh? Where's your corncob pipe?

1240
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,725
<i>The ocean.</i>

1241
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:41,310
Are you wearing gingham panties?

1242
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:42,978
Shh!

1243
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:44,351
Huh?

1244
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,942
Fuck you, you fucking phony.
Come on, show us your panties.

1245
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:49,818
- Shut up.
- Show us your panties, Betty.

1246
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:51,153
- That's enough.
- Fine.

1247
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:52,821
Oh, God, I hate fucking folk music.

1248
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:55,449
- Okay, Eddie. We might need florio.
- I fucking hate folk music.

1249
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,948
Fuck florio. Fuck you, pappi.

1250
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,460
The show is bullshit.

1251
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:09,255
Four micks and grandma Moses.

1252
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,357
Llewyn. Come on in.

1253
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:31,193
Lillian's making her famous
tabbouleh salad.

1254
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:33,237
Oh, Mitch,
I really appreciate this.

1255
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:36,407
After last time, I just can't
tell you how sorry I am.

1256
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,033
Oh, forget it.

1257
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:42,037
We all get a little emotional over Mike.
It comes out in different ways.

1258
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:44,665
He had such life, you know?
Such a talent.

1259
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:47,459
It's a big hole. A big hole.

1260
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:50,295
- How long will you be with us?
- Just a day or two, if that's okay.

1261
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:52,756
- Just until I can figure out the next...
- Sure, yeah.

1262
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,466
Do you know arlen
and dodi gamble?

1263
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:56,635
This is llewyn Davis,
our folk-singer friend.

1264
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,383
You're Jim and Jean's friend.

1265
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,514
Uh, sort of.

1266
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,142
Jim played us a pressing of that record,
"please, Mr. Kennedy."

1267
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:04,768
- It was hysterical.
- So funny.

1268
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,228
That's gonna be a hit, man.

1269
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,480
Royalties on that? Whoa, Nelly.

1270
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:11,480
I wish I was in your business.
I mean, one hit could fix you up.

1271
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:15,195
- Uh, yeah...
- Llewyn.

1272
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:17,990
- Lillian...
- I am so sorry I upset you.

1273
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:22,286
No, no, no.
You're apologizing to me?

1274
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:23,495
- Yeah.
- No.

1275
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:24,705
Holy shit.

1276
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,291
- On! Heh.
- Oh.

1277
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,710
Oh, that's... that's good.
You got a new cat.

1278
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:31,211
- No.
- No, he came home.

1279
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,421
Found his way back.

1280
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:35,090
The doorman heard something
scratching yesterday morning.

1281
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:37,468
- Early morning, the wee hours.
- Yeah, see?

1282
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:39,303
It's ulysses.

1283
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:43,008
- It's... ulysses?
- Ulysses.

1284
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,552
That's its name?

1285
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:20,382
Hello?

1286
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:05,348
<i>And I'll be dead and gone.</i>

1287
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:09,640
<i>I wouldn't mind the hanging.</i>

1288
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:14,439
<i>But the laying in the grave's so long
poor boy.</i>

1289
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:19,692
<i>I've been all around this world.</i>

1290
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:36,128
You probably heard
that one before.

1291
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:41,172
If it was never new, and it never
gets old, then it's a folk song.

1292
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,762
All right, one more before I go.

1293
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:58,775
<i>If I had wings.</i>

1294
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:01,778
<i>Like norah's dove.</i>

1295
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:05,407
<i>I'd fly up the river.</i>

1296
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:09,703
<i>To the one I love.</i>

1297
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:13,665
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

1298
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:16,915
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

1299
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:22,877
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

1300
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:30,432
<i>Early one morning.</i>

1301
01:35:30,433 --> 01:35:32,681
<i>Drizzling rain.</i>

1302
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:36,355
<i>And in my heart.</i>

1303
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:40,686
<i>I felt an achin' pain.</i>

1304
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:44,988
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

1305
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:48,318
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

1306
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:54,533
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

1307
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:01,463
<i>One of these mornings.</i>

1308
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:04,633
<i>It won't be long.</i>

1309
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:07,970
<i>You'll call my name.</i>

1310
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:12,432
<i>And I'll be gone.</i>

1311
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:16,186
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

1312
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:19,812
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

1313
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:25,905
<i>Fare, fare thee well.</i>

1314
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:32,327
<i>If I had wings.</i>

1315
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:35,539
<i>Like norah's dove.</i>

1316
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,750
<i>I'd fly up the river.</i>

1317
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:42,421
<i>To the one I love.</i>

1318
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:46,593
<i>Oh, fare thee well.</i>

1319
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:49,796
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

1320
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:57,513
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

1321
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,776
That's what I got.

1322
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:15,954
- You and Mikey used to do that song.
- Yeah.

1323
01:37:15,955 --> 01:37:18,582
Boy, you were some
mess last night.

1324
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:20,660
Yeah, sorry, pappi.
I'm an asshole.

1325
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:22,794
I don't give a shit.

1326
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:26,131
- Your friend is out back.
- My friend?

1327
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:29,757
Said he was a friend of yours.
Guy in a suit.

1328
01:37:30,887 --> 01:37:36,892
<i>Oh, it's fare thee well
my darling true.</i>

1329
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:41,314
<i>I'm leaving in the first hour
of the morn.</i>

1330
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:51,949
You a funny boy, huh?

1331
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:55,236
What?

1332
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:59,206
Had to open your big mouth.

1333
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:01,910
That's what I do for a living.

1334
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:07,041
What you do.
Make fun of folks up there?

1335
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:13,345
You sit there in the audience
last night, yelling your crap.

1336
01:38:13,346 --> 01:38:15,514
You yell stuff, man. It's a show.

1337
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,725
It wasn't your show.

1338
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:21,554
It's not the opera, jackass.
It's a fucking basket hou...

1339
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:25,812
We're leaving this fucking cesspool.
You can have it.

1340
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:28,899
What you do.

1341
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:36,737
- My wife up there trying to sing.
- Unh.

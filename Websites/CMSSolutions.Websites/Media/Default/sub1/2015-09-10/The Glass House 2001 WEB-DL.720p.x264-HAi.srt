1
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,100
Scared the living crap out of me.

2
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,200
Meryl Streep she wasn't.

3
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Who's Meryl Streep?

4
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,000
Zoe, she's like Katie Holmes
to our parents.

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,700
So, what's next, ladies?

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,600
-I have to go home.
-No.

7
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,300
I can't have another fight with
my parents. They think I'm in bed.

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,900
Were you kids in bed early?

9
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,300
-I stayed up till 1 0.
-After 9, Rhett was asleep.

10
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,400
-Who's driving them?
-I will.

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,700
Nicki's selling coffee at school,
I'm helping her.

12
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,800
It sucks.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Do not say "sucks," say "disappoints."

14
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,200
I don't need a lunch.
I'll go with Tash.

15
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,200
Eat pizza three days in a row?
I think not.

16
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,400
That's really good.

17
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,000
The proportions are perfect...

18
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,800
...but do you draw
what you really see?

19
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,600
The simplest is the hardest.
Seeing what's in front of you.

20
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,200
What's on for tonight?

21
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,700
I am so grounded. I got busted
sneaking back inside last night.

22
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,800
-Damn, how'd you manage that?
-My dad set the motion detector.

23
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,400
Our parents are getting
paranoid in their old age.

24
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,600
Mine still trust me.

25
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,800
It's beautiful.

26
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Not a bad couple of decades.

27
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,000
Better than the first two
without you.

28
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,700
To 20 years of you and me.

29
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,900
And to our children, safe at home.

30
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,700
Hey, cool, you lost them!

31
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,800
Macho Mustang boys, to boot!

32
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,600
-We struck a blow for sisterhood!
-The only "blow" you know.

33
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,400
Diss.

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,700
-Any raves?
-Full Moon Underground.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,800
San Bernardino.
Probably Saturday.

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,400
I'll tell Mom I'm staying with you.

37
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,500
I can't believe you
still work that scam.

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,400
What can I say?
My 'rents are clueless.

39
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,400
I'll bring glowsticks if you buy gas.

40
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,300
-That's such a good idea!
-Nice try, Beams.

41
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,700
Rest, it'll be one hell of a weekend.

42
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,300
-Bye, Tasha.
-Don't let the bedbugs bite!

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,000
Hasta!

44
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,500
Now they call the cops on me.

45
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,600
Hello!

46
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,600
Hello!

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm sorry I'm late.

48
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,100
Ruby Baker?

49
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,200
Yeah, I'm Ruby.

50
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,800
Whatever they said, I'm not missing.
I just went out.

51
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,400
Your parents were in a car accident.

52
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,800
Are they okay?

53
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,500
-Ruby, why don't you have a seat, hon?
-Are they okay?

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,200
My partner will help you have a seat.
Ruby.

55
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,400
-I can sit down myself.
-I know.

56
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,600
Are they okay?

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,700
-Relax.
-We're here to help you.

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
You'll be okay.

59
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,400
Relax. Ruby?

60
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Ruby.

61
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
You'll be okay.

62
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,900
-Get her pulse.
-Can you hear me, Ruby?

63
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
"They are as asleep.

64
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,300
In the morning, they're like grass
which groweth up.

65
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,600
In the morning, it flourisheth
and groweth up.

66
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,400
In the evening, it is cut down
and withereth...

67
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,300
...for we're consumed by thine anger
and by thy wrath we're troubled.

68
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,600
Thou has set our iniquities
before thee, our secret sins...

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,300
...in the light of thy countenance.

70
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,000
For all our days are
passed away in thy wrath.

71
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,200
We spend our years as
a tale that is told...

72
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,100
...so teach us to number our days...

73
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,000
...that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom."

74
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,100
I think Rhett Baker wants to
say something. Rhett?

75
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,300
I just--

76
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,400
I just wanna say....

77
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,900
I just....

78
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,800
It's okay.

79
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,300
I didn't work with Dave and Grace
or see them every day...

80
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
...but I knew them for 1 0 years...

81
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,000
...and I'm sure if they
could hear this....

82
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, Grace...

83
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,600
...would do her dismissive
little giggle.

84
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,200
You know the one.

85
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,500
And Dave would mutter
an "expletive deleted."

86
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,700
They'd hate to be remembered
as anything but...

87
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,400
...ordinary.

88
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,100
Which is exactly what they were:

89
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,900
Anything but ordinary.

90
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,300
But they will live on...

91
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,300
...through their children
and in all our hearts.

92
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,900
Ruby?

93
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,100
Do you remember me?

94
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,400
I'm Uncle Jack,
your mom's brother.

95
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I'll go wait by the car, okay?

96
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,800
If there's anything that you need...

97
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,800
...anything I can do...

98
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,000
...l don't mean in the next few weeks
or months, I mean anytime.

99
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,900
How come I haven't seen you
in, like, 1 0 years?

100
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,600
Have you even met my brother Rhett?

101
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
Well, of course I have.

102
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,300
I haven't seen either of you in years.

103
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,100
First of all, I live pretty far away.
Chicago.

104
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,300
Then how will you help us?

105
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,500
I don't know.
There's the phone, e-mail.

106
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,100
-You and my mom never wrote.
-That's true.

107
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
As siblings get older,
they go separate ways.

108
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,600
-You and Rhett are close now--
-We're not.

109
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,100
We have nothing in common.

110
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,900
Used to feel that way about your mom.
It's not true.

111
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,700
I used to think I'd take a month off
and come out here...

112
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,300
...and get to know you,
your brother and Grace again.

113
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,100
Nice to see you.
Sorry things didn't work out.

114
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,700
-I'll call you later, okay?
-Okay.

115
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,900
Ruby? Hi.

116
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,100
-I'm Alvin Begleiter.
-Hi.

117
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm so sorry.

118
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,100
I'm your--
I was your parents' estate lawyer.

119
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,700
I planned their wills...

120
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,900
...what they wanted to do
with their money and--

121
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,000
The most important issue right now
is who'll take care of you.

122
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,700
You and Rhett.

123
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,500
I'm assuming you know the Glasses?

124
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,500
I've known them my whole life.

125
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,500
Good. I know that your parents...

126
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,400
...chose them after a great deal
of consideration.

127
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,800
And there's something else.

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,200
Your parents were extremely thrifty...

129
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,500
...and with your mom's share,
your dad's life insurance...

130
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,200
...there's enough for you
and Rhett for the rest of your lives.

131
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,700
Obviously you don't know Rhett.

132
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,500
That's good.
I'll give you one of my cards.

133
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
I don't expect trouble.

134
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,000
But if you have any concerns,
any problems....

135
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,600
I'm an estate lawyer
and also a trust lawyer.

136
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,800
I want to be someone you can trust.

137
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,000
-You call me, okay?
-Okay.

138
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,300
Mr. Glass.

139
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,000
-Ruby.
-Thank you.

140
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,100
My mom and dad would've
loved that speech.

141
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,300
-They would've loved it.
-Come here.

142
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,200
That's good.
We're gonna get through this.

143
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,000
We'll get through it together, okay?

144
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,300
Oh, Ruby.

145
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,600
You're in good hands.

146
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Hey!

147
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,000
-You guys ready for Malibu?
-It'll be a change, we won't lie.

148
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,000
It's not the worst place.

149
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,800
-Is this your car?
-My company's, on loan for today.

150
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,600
Sweet!

151
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
This place is huge!

152
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,100
Hey, Rubes, check out this view.

153
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,300
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

154
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,100
-Cool, a meteorite!
-It's art, Rhett.

155
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,700
Give them the tour.
Stall them, I'll order dinner.

156
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,200
Let's get the lay of the land.

157
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,500
Master suite.

158
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,300
Home gym.

159
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,200
-Home theater.
-Sweet.

160
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,400
-You never have to leave home.
-If only.

161
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Vicki comes in most days.

162
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,500
-Hola, ninos.
-Hola.

163
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,900
Hello!

164
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,500
This is your room.

165
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,000
It's temporary quarters, of course.

166
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,800
Unpack, get settled,
and I'll meet you in the kitchen.

167
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,200
We're sharing a room?

168
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,700
Glance at me when I'm changing
and you're busted.

169
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,300
We have a little calamari,
a little risotto with mushrooms...

170
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,000
...and green salad with
some Swiss chard.

171
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,400
-Do you have any Garfield?
-What is that?

172
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,700
-It's crap in a can.
-If it's crap, how come you eat it?

173
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,600
-Come on, kids. Try the calamari.
-Isn't that squid?

174
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,500
-Honey, tonight....
-I'll call Domino's.

175
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,400
Thank you.

176
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,900
Can you turn and face the wall?

177
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,000
Who are you, the Blair Witch?

178
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,700
I'm worse. Just face the wall.

179
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,300
Turn that stupid thing off!

180
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,100
There's public school,
then there's public school.

181
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,200
Trust me, there won't be any
Bloods or Crips.

182
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,600
I'm not scared of getting gunned down.

183
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,300
-You're a great kid--
-It's not about being great.

184
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,300
-It's about being....
-New?

185
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,800
Middle-of-the-year new.

186
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,900
There's a saying we teach
the Pain Ward patients.

187
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,000
"This too shall pass."

188
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,500
This too shall pass.
This too shall pass.

189
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Hi.

190
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,300
Why don't you take
a seat in the back?

191
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
We have a new addition.

192
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Would you introduce yourself,
Miss Baker?

193
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,400
You just did.

194
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,400
Hi.

195
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,300
I'm Ruby Baker.

196
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,600
I used to go to Shady Lane.
That's in the Valley.

197
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,800
Not my choice,
just an accident of birth.

198
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,500
How come you moved here?

199
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,200
It was another accident.

200
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Let's make Ruby feel welcome.

201
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,400
Thanks for the lift.

202
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,400
Sweet!

203
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,900
I can't believe it!

204
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,900
Like one of those isn't noisy enough?

205
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
No, Rubes. You can't play
"Pokémon Snap" on PlayStation.

206
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,700
You can play "Ape Escape,"
but not on N-64.

207
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,500
Mom and Dad would freak out.

208
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,100
Don't talk about them.

209
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,300
I haven't seen one girl
with blue-black hair.

210
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,900
The guys surf and swim all day.
That sun-worshiping culture.

211
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,600
That sounds hot.

212
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,400
I checked my pager all day.
I figured you'd call and you didn't.

213
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,100
Cell phones are banned at school.
The kids don't care.

214
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,100
They can't see they
lost their liberties.

215
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,500
They have so much sunstroke,
they're wasted.

216
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,500
Ruby?

217
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,300
I got us an assortment
of different things.

218
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,600
Some cold pastas, some salads.

219
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,800
Ruby, I think that you'd be
well-served by a better attitude.

220
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,000
It's okay. I don't mind take-out.
You're busy.

221
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,100
It's not from Wendy's.

222
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,500
I meant your attitude
toward your new school.

223
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,100
-My attitude?
-I overheard your conversation.

224
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,900
You were listening in?

225
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,000
No, I was trying to get a line out,
but that's beside the point.

226
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,700
The point is, you need those
kids to like you.

227
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,900
Otherwise, you'll isolate,
sabotage yourself.

228
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
-You'll have a miserable time.
-Okay, I get it.

229
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,400
I learned something.

230
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,400
Ruby?

231
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,300
Ruby.

232
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,100
-Wake up.
-I'm awake.

233
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,600
-Wake up.
-Mommy?

234
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
Mommy?

235
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,600
You scared the crap out of me.

236
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,700
I heard noises. I thought
it was a burglar or coyote.

237
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,900
I'm not used to kids here.

238
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,900
Come here.

239
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,900
Thank you.

240
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,500
You must be freezing.

241
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,600
No more 3 a.m. swims. With all
the glass, you hear everything.

242
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,200
I'll set the alarm at night.

243
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,600
Are you coming?

244
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Drunk driving among teens has...

245
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,600
...steadily decreased,
but we can do better.

246
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,800
As these images starkly attest...

247
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,300
...alcohol remains the No. 1
problem among teens.

248
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,900
This year, 20 percent
of teenage drivers....

249
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,100
How was your first day
of Driver's Ed?

250
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,800
-Fine, I guess.
-They still show gruesome movies?

251
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,000
Those were the Dark Ages.

252
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,600
They have better ways
of teaching kids today.

253
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,400
May I be excused?

254
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,200
Stupid, kid-proof piece of crap.

255
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,500
Ruby?

256
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,400
Was it awful?
I mean, the driving class?

257
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,800
-I can just imagine.
-No, it's....

258
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,100
I have my period.

259
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,100
Come with me.

260
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Thank you.

261
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Four doctors recommend....

262
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,700
This cramp, too, shall pass.

263
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,000
I'll turn it off
when I get to a save point.

264
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,400
It's cool. I don't care.

265
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,100
It's kind of relaxing.

266
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,400
Erin, get out of there!

267
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,400
What were you doing in there?
Tell me the truth!

268
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
-What are you implying?
-Tell me!

269
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,700
No, I won't answer you!
Good night!

270
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,900
-What the hell are you doing?
-Getting ready for bed.

271
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,000
-Watch your language.
-Don't play games with me.

272
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,600
You know what I'm talking about.

273
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,700
I'm too tired to guess.
I'm sick of your accusations.

274
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,000
Is that what you call it now?

275
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,900
-How many--
-I've done every--

276
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,300
You told me you--

277
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,400
Ruby?

278
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,800
-Hi, I'm Hannah.
-Hi.

279
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,400
There's this rumor you were
on academic probation.

280
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,500
Cut to the chase, huh?

281
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,500
I was. I had sex with the dean
and he took it off my record.

282
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,200
Oh, not really.

283
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,700
I was supposed to be at
my friend Tasha's...

284
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,200
...doing an essay,
and went to this rave.

285
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,700
Sunday I was fried and
downloaded this thing off the net.

286
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,400
-Tuesday, I was busted.
-Hey, Hannah!

287
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,200
-Hey! I gotta go.
-Bye.

288
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,700
Hey, Ruby.

289
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,200
My company's driving people
to a premiere.

290
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,200
I gotta make sure everything
runs smooth. Wanna come?

291
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,700
I have homework, three more hours.
Pretty heavy, so....

292
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,500
That's perfect.

293
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,700
Can we catch the end of the movie
or go to the party?

294
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,100
Actually, the hell with Westwood.

295
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,500
-My drivers can handle a premiere.
-Evening, sir.

296
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,000
Mud pie for the lady.
Ketel One, rocks, for me.

297
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
Great.

298
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,500
Thank you.

299
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,300
That party'd be a mob scene.
I really want to talk to you.

300
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

301
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,900
I remember when you guys moved
down the block 11 years ago.

302
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,600
It was funny. I noticed the furniture
as they brought it in.

303
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
Erin noticed a little girl.

304
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,200
But you were upset.
I guess about moving cross-country.

305
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,400
You wouldn't say a word.

306
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,900
Just hugged this plastic doll
against your chest.

307
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,800
Malibu Barbie, I think it was.
Prophetic, huh?

308
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,100
Think you mean "pathetic."

309
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,200
No, no.

310
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,300
-I guess you moved on years ago.
-From what?

311
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,700
From hugging plastic dolls.

312
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,700
I should hope so.

313
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,700
Last night, when you fought...

314
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,900
...it wasn't about us, right?

315
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,900
No. Married people sometimes
like to...

316
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,800
...push each other's buttons.

317
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,800
It's a form of intimacy,
a lower form, nothing serious.

318
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,300
One thing I haven't said about Erin:

319
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,200
It can be lonely living with her.

320
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,800
But that's my cross to bear,
not yours.

321
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,300
I think it's past my bedtime, Terry.

322
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,400
Of course it is.

323
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,700
Let's get you to bed.

324
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Terry.

325
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
You're not wearing
your shoulder belt.

326
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,100
Hey.

327
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,300
Try not to make too much noise.
Rhett and Erin are asleep.

328
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,600
Okay?

329
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,300
Hamlet senses something's wrong...

330
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
...that he alone can set right.

331
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,000
I want two pages next Friday...

332
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,800
...about what he means
and whether he succeeds.

333
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,900
Mr. Begleiter, before my parents--

334
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,500
They ever speak about
guardians for Rhett and me?

335
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,600
Different from the Glasses? No.

336
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,800
-I think they wanted to.
-They discussed it with you?

337
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,900
No, but my parents weren't
friendly with them after they moved.

338
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,200
Ruby, the Glasses aren't your parents.

339
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,400
They'll never be your parents.

340
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,600
-If Erin or Terry has done anything--
-We sleep in one room.

341
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,300
That's not ideal.

342
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,000
The other night we were alone
in Terry's car. He--

343
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,500
What? What did he do?

344
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,000
He just put my seat belt on.

345
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,300
The way he leaned across me wasn't--
It just-- And I felt....

346
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,100
I know it sounds stupid.

347
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,800
And then...

348
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,500
...Erin was shooting up.
I saw her holding a needle.

349
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,400
Anyway, she looked really baked.

350
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,000
Ruby.

351
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,300
Ruby.

352
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,200
Try and understand this.

353
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,700
The accident, in effect...

354
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,000
...orphaned you and your brother.

355
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,000
So if this doesn't work out
with the Glasses...

356
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,700
...you've no place to go.

357
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,500
You'll become wards of the state.

358
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,900
I'm not trying to scare you.

359
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm just telling you the facts of life.

360
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,600
I drove halfway here
with the housekeeper...

361
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,200
...and then hitchhiked
and I was scared.

362
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,300
But I told myself once I made it,
you'd help me and Rhett.

363
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,800
When we met, you said
I could trust you.

364
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,600
Okay.

365
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,900
All right.

366
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,400
I believe you. And I know
who to get in touch with.

367
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,400
It's not gonna be easy.
I can't promise you results.

368
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,700
But I promise you that I'll look
into this. You have my word on that.

369
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,200
Thank you.

370
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,600
When we spoke after the funeral...

371
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,000
...you had said that...

372
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,300
...we had more than enough.

373
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,400
How much would that be exactly?

374
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,100
That's a question for the
trust officer at the bank.

375
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,100
But between us,
four million dollars.

376
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,200
So you can see,
you're financially very secure.

377
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,800
Yeah.

378
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,200
Now why don't you go home.
And do me one more favor?

379
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,400
No hitchhiking.

380
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,500
-This is out, okay?
-Yes, sir.

381
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,500
Alvin Begleiter calling.

382
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,900
I just had a disturbing visit
from Ruby Baker.

383
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,100
Rhett, why don't you leave that now?

384
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,300
Go and do some homework.

385
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
I have a lot of homework too.

386
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,600
Stay a minute, would you?

387
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,000
What you saw last night
isn't what you think.

388
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,100
Erin suffers from diabetes.

389
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,600
I hid it.

390
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,900
I don't want you or Rhett to worry.
The disease is under control.

391
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,500
You saw Erin giving herself
her nightly insulin injection.

392
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,400
Must've been a shock to walk in on.

393
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,000
One more thing.

394
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,900
Terry tells me that you got a
little skittish with him last night.

395
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,800
That makes us feel sad.
We want you to trust us, Ruby.

396
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,800
We need your trust.

397
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,800
I overreacted, I'm sorry.

398
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,600
There're still things
I need to get used to.

399
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,100
We all do.

400
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,900
We're all under stress.

401
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,300
I'm gonna begin my Hamlet paper.

402
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,000
If you need help, let me know.

403
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,600
That'd be great.

404
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,800
That's fine. Put it in park
and step out.

405
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,400
And Ruby? You'll get behind
the wheel next.

406
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,800
You can apply a bit more gas.

407
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,600
Sorry, I'm a bad driver.

408
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
There aren't any bad,
just inexperienced.

409
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,800
Take a breath, start driving back.

410
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,200
Bye.

411
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,900
He's not in now.
I'll have him call you back.

412
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,700
He's not in now.
I'll have him call you back.

413
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,800
Hi.

414
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,400
-I'm Ruby Baker. Terry's--
-I know who you are.

415
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
Okay. Cool.

416
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,500
I came to catch a ride from Terry.

417
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,800
He's having a powwow with
some people now.

418
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,200
-If you wanna wait, there's a lounge.
-Okay, thanks.

419
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,000
-Glass Transit, may I help you?
-Any service technician to the office.

420
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,600
-What's going on, Terry?
-The usual.

421
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,700
Not to worry.
Nothing that can't be handled.

422
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,800
-We had a payment plan.
-The dates arrive, the money doesn't.

423
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,700
About that payment plan.
Nicole had a day...

424
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,700
...I'd call it unrealistic.

425
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,700
-You proposed that plan.
-I know.

426
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,900
-It's not dishonesty. We gotta--
-What is it?

427
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,500
Na"i"ve optimism.

428
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
But I'm an optimist by nature.

429
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,500
I'm betting on myself.

430
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
I'll be right there.

431
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,700
-Where's the money?
-You're not listening. The money--

432
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,200
-Say is, as in, "the money is."
-Yeah.

433
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,200
Can I help you?

434
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,500
-Whose car is this?
-Hell if I know. Showed up one day.

435
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,200
-One day, when?
-I don't know. Few months ago?

436
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,400
-We had a car like this.
-You really shouldn't be back here.

437
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,300
Ruby?

438
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,400
Ruby?

439
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,200
What happened was nothing.
Just a business glitch.

440
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,300
Hope you didn't get freaked.
People get weird about money.

441
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:28,800
I didn't mean to just show up.
I waited for Vicki and she never came.

442
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,800
We had to let her go.
Erin got held up at the hospital.

443
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,700
-Back up. You had to let Vicki go?
-We had to.

444
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,800
She drove you without permission.

445
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,500
Just to Santa Monica,
to the Promenade.

446
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,100
How did you know that she drove me?

447
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,000
How did we know? It's our job to know.

448
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,400
-Did you have a hard day at work?
-It was fine, thanks.

449
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,800
Hamlet.

450
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,000
Don't you hate how he can't
make up his mind?

451
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,700
To be, not be, not not be,
be, be not.

452
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,600
My father drove a Saab.

453
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,500
Terry!

454
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,600
Thank you.

455
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,300
For finishing my paper.

456
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,600
That would be wrong.

457
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,000
-Ruby.
-Yeah?

458
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,700
Come with me.

459
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,100
Sure.

460
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,100
Ruby Baker? I'm Nancy Ryan.

461
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,500
I'm an inspector with Social Services.

462
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,600
Your lawyer said you
have problems with your guardians.

463
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,400
Please relax and be open.
Everything said here stays private.

464
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,300
Okay? So...

465
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,500
...you're 1 6...

466
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,100
...and your brother is 11 ,
and you share a bedroom?

467
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,100
Yeah, for now.

468
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,500
And you saw Erin Glass
injecting herself?

469
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,600
-They said she has diabetes.
-Diabetes? I'm gonna check that.

470
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,400
Now it's gonna be in writing twice.

471
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,100
My word still won't count
next to the Glasses.

472
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,800
Which is why I'll phone the Glasses
and ask them to meet me...

473
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,000
...so I can verify everything.

474
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,800
-Okay?
-But...

475
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,400
...how can I live with them?

476
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,000
-Do you wanna live with them?
-Sometimes things are fine.

477
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,100
Last night, Terry helped me
with something...

478
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,800
...but maybe that was
to keep me happy.

479
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,800
I know this is scary for you,
but don't worry.

480
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,200
We tell the guardians that we
perform a routine inspection.

481
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,000
If it's still in progress...

482
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,500
...you just act like we've
never met or spoken.

483
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,600
You have no idea why I'm there. Okay?

484
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,100
This is my husband, Terry Glass.

485
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,900
-Hello.
-Hello.

486
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:03,000
Is this necessary in the middle
of the day?

487
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,200
We'll get this done
as quickly as possible.

488
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,100
It's intrusive.
Let's get it over with.

489
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,700
-May l...?
-Of course.

490
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,700
Only one child sleeps here?

491
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,700
Yes, Rhett.

492
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,800
And the girl, Ruby,
she has her own room?

493
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,800
-Of course.
-She's 1 6.

494
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,900
Nice accommodations.

495
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,600
The kids are home.
Do you want to meet them?

496
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,000
Yes, I would. Just to say hi.

497
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,500
But first, Dr. Glass,
may I look upstairs?

498
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,400
This is awkward,
but it's also important.

499
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,100
It's a matter of safety,
so there's nothing...

500
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,500
...dangerous in easy reach.

501
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:53,000
-"Humulin L and U."
-Diabetes. I'm insulin-dependent.

502
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,700
We have it totally under control.

503
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,300
It would appear that you do.

504
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,500
Here's the two best kids in the world.

505
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,200
Hi, you must be Rhett. I'm Nancy Ryan.

506
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,000
Nice to meet you.

507
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,500
So Rhett, how do you spend
your evenings?

508
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,300
When I finish my homework, I read.

509
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,600
And you must be Ruby.
You have a very nice room.

510
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,400
You've made a wonderful home
for these children.

511
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,300
-Thank you, Dr. Glass.
-Thank you.

512
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,000
We'll see you out.

513
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,100
You read? You lie.

514
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,100
Guess who I learned from?

515
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,200
Bye now.

516
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,000
Why don't we order some dinner, hon?

517
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,200
How do you like your new room?

518
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,200
Couldn't have come at a better time.

519
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,100
Come on, Mr. Begleiter.

520
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,900
-Hello?
-Sorry to disturb you this late.

521
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,400
But I found myself wondering,
"Where's the money?"

522
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,500
You might as well know.

523
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,400
Six months ago I took on a partner.
A silent partner and...

524
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,700
...l recently found out
he was skimming cash.

525
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,000
You've lost me. What does
this have to do with our loan?

526
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,000
I'm waiting, Mr. Glass.

527
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:48,100
-Mr. Glass, you still there?
-Yeah.

528
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,300
He charged personal
expenses to the company.

529
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,900
When I want a heartbreaking
human interest story...

530
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,800
...I'll watch the news.

531
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:05,600
Meanwhile, your payment's due
tomorrow, close of business.

532
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,200
Do you fully understand me?

533
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,900
Mr. Glass?

534
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,900
I'm here.

535
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,900
I'm seeking full restitution
from my partner.

536
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,900
Plus I found a whole new
source of equity.

537
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,500
My big, new, personal piggy bank.

538
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,500
So you can expect another $30,000.

539
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,200
That barely covers interest.
You need to pay off the principal.

540
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,600
But I need some more time.
Not a lot more time.

541
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,100
A week at the most.

542
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,300
We'll give you two days,
because we like you.

543
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,400
We'd hate for you to find
your beautiful house burnt down...

544
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,100
...with your wife inside.

545
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,800
Yeah?

546
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,800
"I unfold a tale whose
word would harrow up thy soul...

547
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
...freeze thy young blood...

548
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,900
...make thy two eyes
start from their spheres...

549
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,000
...and each hair to stand an end.

550
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,400
If thou didst thy father love...

551
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,200
...revenge his foul and unnatural
murder. Murder most foul...

552
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,200
But this most foul,
strange, and unnatural...."

553
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,200
Begleiter and Brice.

554
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,600
-This is Ruby Baker for Mr. Begleiter.
-One moment.

555
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,500
-Did you get my e-mail?
-No, Terry trashed my account.

556
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,500
Or maybe the bill didn't get paid.

557
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,100
Did you find out about the BMW?

558
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,000
Right, the BMW.

559
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,300
It was registered
to a business: G.T.I.

560
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,800
Glass Transit Incorporated.

561
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,500
-Terry's company.
-Now don't you get it?

562
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,500
Ruby, please come with me.

563
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,200
I have to call you back later.
Bye-bye.

564
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,100
This is Miss Bassett,
our vice principal.

565
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
Ruby.

566
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,500
The paper you turned in to Mr. Kim,
that was your work, nobody helped?

567
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,800
-No.
-Not even Harold Bloom?

568
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,600
"Dance of contraries,"
didn't sound like a student.

569
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,300
I found it and other phrases
in Mr. Bloom's book:

570
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,300
Shakespeare:
The Invention of the Human.

571
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,200
We were told there's a case of
plagiarism on your school record.

572
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,000
You understand why we have to
take decisive action--

573
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,800
You were told?

574
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,600
-By who?
-That is hardly the issue here.

575
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,900
This sort of cheating
has to have real consequences.

576
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,300
We've spoken to your guardians.

577
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,600
Of course you have.

578
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,400
Frankly, we're not sure whether
you can continue at this school.

579
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,100
Well?

580
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,300
Why don't you ask Terry?

581
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,900
Or maybe it's time you took
some responsibility.

582
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,800
Maybe it's time.

583
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,000
This is Jack Avery.
I'm out of the country...

584
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,800
...but I'm checking my messages.

585
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,900
Wake up.

586
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,900
Don't make a sound.
Get dressed. We're gonna go.

587
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,300
-Where? With who?
-Away with me.

588
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,700
-Quit it! You're looking!
-Like there's something to see.

589
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,700
It's raining. I was sleeping.
I don't wanna go.

590
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,400
It'll be really fun.

591
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,200
They're giving away
Dragon Ball Z at Blockbuster.

592
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,400
We can go and avoid the rush.

593
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,800
Really?

594
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,800
Close the door.

595
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,300
What if they find out?

596
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,400
I'll take the blame.
Get in the car.

597
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,400
You don't know what you're doing.

598
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,600
Wanna slow down a little?

599
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:16,000
One thing I learned from Terry:
Buckle up.

600
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,600
-Terry's gonna kill you!
-Maybe so.

601
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,700
Turn that off.

602
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,600
Turn that shit off!

603
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,500
Look out!

604
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,100
You almost creamed that guy!

605
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,000
Right. Turn it off!

606
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,200
-I wanna go back.
-We're not.

607
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,400
-What do you mean?
-Figure it out.

608
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,600
We have to! You tricked me
and now I'm in trouble.

609
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,300
-The Glasses tricked you.
-What?

610
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,900
Did not. They're sleeping.

611
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:02,100
They were gonna send me away
and you'd stay home with them.

612
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,900
I like Terry. I like Erin.

613
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,600
You like the shit they buy you.
You couldn't see it.

614
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,100
They made you lie
to that social worker.

615
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,300
I didn't know she was
a social worker.

616
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,800
You didn't wanna lose
your Nintendo.

617
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,700
They bought you off.

618
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:26,800
-Where are you taking us?
-The point was to get away.

619
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,100
Crap.

620
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,500
Don't say anything stupid.

621
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,200
The highway is closed.

622
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,300
There's a mudslide.
You need to use Malibu Canyon....

623
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,200
-Can I see your driver's license?
-My license?

624
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:10,200
-And your registration too.
-It's....

625
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,800
It's over there in all my stuff.

626
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,700
I think I saw it over here.

627
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,400
Pull onto the shoulder and step out.

628
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,400
Officer!

629
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,400
These are my kids.

630
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,600
Terry Glass, Glass Transit.

631
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,400
-We loaned you limos for the parade.
-How are you?

632
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,900
Rhett, poor baby! Come with me.

633
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,200
We have a behavior problem
back at home.

634
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,300
Your sister's going through
a hard time right now.

635
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:01,000
-You know, teenage-girl stuff.
-Got you.

636
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,100
Good luck.

637
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,900
Move over.

638
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,500
-You can turn around here.
-Thanks.

639
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,500
Don't you have anything to say to me?

640
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,000
You killed my parents.

641
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
That's insane and hurtful.

642
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:54,700
You're threatened by your
business associates. I saw it.

643
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,200
Like Erin said to me,
"We need your trust."

644
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,200
You need my trust,
$4 million worth.

645
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,800
I got a business.
My wife's a successful doctor.

646
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,300
-I got a big, new--
-"Piggy bank."

647
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,200
That's just words out of context.

648
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,900
-What about the BMW my dad drove?
-What about it?!

649
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,600
For their anniversary,
I lent them a Beemer...

650
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,600
...so Dave wouldn't drive her
in that Saab...

651
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,400
...which I repainted.

652
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,500
No good deed goes unpunished.

653
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,100
In your trashy mind,
you twisted that into--

654
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,900
What do you think? Cut the steering,
stripped the brakes?

655
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,600
Yeah.

656
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,500
It's understandable,
basic psychology.

657
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,700
You don't wanna blame your dad.

658
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,600
That he had too much booze
that night.

659
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,300
Then you'd
ask why your mom and dad...

660
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,700
...hit the bottle.
Whose behavior drove them to drink?

661
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,400
Get this straight.

662
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:24,600
You and Rhett are mine.

663
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,200
I suggest you forget your lurid,
adolescent fantasies and start--

664
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,400
Help!

665
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,300
-Let me go, bastard!
-Calm down, little girl!

666
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,800
What's happening out there?

667
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,800
Your sister is having a tantrum.

668
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:09,100
Come on. Come back to bed.

669
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,600
Let me go! Get off!

670
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,400
Let go!

671
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,200
You...!

672
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,100
Listen hard, Ruby.

673
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,300
Anything happens to you,
we got Rhett...

674
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,700
...and all we need is one child.

675
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,800
Erin! Stop him, please!

676
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,400
Erin!

677
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:49,600
Please come help me, please!
He's not gonna hurt you!

678
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:54,400
Erin, please don't! Erin, don't! No!

679
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,200
Thank you for listening.

680
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:10,200
You'll feel better now, Ruby.
Rest, relax.

681
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,900
-Where to, ladies?
-The mall.

682
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,500
Time-out.
Has anyone heard from Ruby?

683
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:38,000
-Me? Not for a month.
-Same. Won't even answer my e-mails.

684
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,400
What up with Little Miss Malibu?
Too busy bodysurfing?

685
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,600
Then we are too busy for her.

686
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,100
-Hello?
-Where's the rest of our money?

687
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,400
The bank sent me a check
with the wrong zip code.

688
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:07,200
Some incompetent jerk at the bank
inverted the last digits!

689
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,600
So I'll need another--

690
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:20,400
We gotta expand the house,
a wing for the kids.

691
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:25,500
Our little boy gets bigger every day,
and the girl is a teen.

692
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,900
I don't know if you have kids....

693
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:35,500
Anyway, construction costs
in Malibu are off the charts.

694
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,300
I'm estimating a quarter million.

695
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:43,900
We'll need to see blueprints.
There's an approval process.

696
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,100
You can't get them
without an architect.

697
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,700
Mine wants a cash down payment.
He's in demand.

698
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,800
I believe we advanced you...

699
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,100
...$30,000 for that purpose
just last month.

700
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:04,700
But that was for a room,
before I realized I needed a wing.

701
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,900
Isn't a guardian supposed to
keep the kids comfortable?

702
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,700
Here's the trust.

703
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,300
It authorizes me to use money
to enlarge the house.

704
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,200
And guardians aren't supposed
to suffer economically...

705
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:26,000
...in fulfilling their obligations?
I'm paying two tuitions.

706
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:31,300
I employ a nanny. The kids see
therapists to deal with the tragedy.

707
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,700
I plan trips to broaden
their horizons...

708
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:39,000
... and it's like a root canal
when I need reimbursement.

709
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,600
-Where'd you get it?
-You faxed it to us last week.

710
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:55,200
I'm surprised to hear you have
both children at Westcott.

711
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:02,900
Did I say Westcott? We changed our
minds about it. It's too glitzy.

712
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:09,200
-We gotta do what's best for them.
-Isn't that the truth?

713
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Thank you for waiting.
I'll take your order.

714
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,700
I need five dozen
1 0cc syringes fentanyl...

715
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,500
...and I need two dozen
20cc syringes Demerol.

716
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,500
We sent up 60 of fentanyl on Monday.

717
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,100
I doubled the PCA infusion
rate of Demerol in six patients.

718
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,900
Dr. Glass?

719
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,700
I'm on the phone with the pharmacy.

720
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Dr. Wise wants to see you.

721
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,400
The Medical Director.

722
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,400
Wake up, Ruby.

723
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,000
Sleeping Beauty.

724
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,300
All you do is sleep. It scares me.

725
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:25,100
So you're losing your medical license.
That's wonderful.

726
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,700
-I have a sickness.
-Yeah, it's called self-pity.

727
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,800
Complicated by being born
without a freaking backbone.

728
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,300
So I'm weak, am l?

729
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,400
Maybe I am.

730
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,400
At least I'm not greedy
and reckless...

731
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,200
...borrowing a million
from loan sharks--

732
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,700
Which should've been paid off!
We had a good thing going...

733
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,900
...till you put your hand in.

734
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,400
A good thing? You son of a bitch!

735
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,400
-I was a doctor!
-Yeah, but you became a junkie.

736
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:05,800
Not until you did what you did.

737
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,500
Where were you when I did it?

738
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:17,000
Right. I saw an opportunity, Erin.

739
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,300
I saw an opportunity and grabbed it.

740
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:24,800
I had what you didn't.
I had the nerve, the will.

741
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,300
Since nobody gave me
a chance, I took it.

742
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,900
I'm not doing this anymore.

743
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,100
It's already done.

744
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:40,300
This is about containing the damage.
Understand?

745
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:43,900
Good.

746
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,400
You know we have to
get rid of the girl.

747
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,000
Speaking of which, we're dry?

748
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,900
There's nothing to take care of her,
so I'll get something.

749
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,400
If I can't find drugs in L.A....

750
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,700
Hi!

751
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,200
Wave at the camera, Ruby.
Wave at the camera!

752
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,200
They can't catch me!

753
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,700
-Come in the water, Erin!
-Wait! I'm coming too!

754
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,600
Spin me, Erin! Faster!
-Good girl.

755
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,300
Rhett. Rhett, move away.

756
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,500
Erin! It took some doing...

757
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,800
...but I found some
pharmaceutical morphine.

758
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,000
Erin?

759
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,700
God, not now.

760
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,100
Erin?

761
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,100
Erin?

762
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:18,200
1 875 Montego Canyon.

763
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,300
I thought you'd wanna know.

764
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,000
Ruby?

765
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,700
Honey?

766
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,100
Terry needs to talk to you kids.

767
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,500
You kids are a handful,
you know that?

768
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,300
Where's your sister?
Where's your damn sister?

769
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,700
I should've put you here from day one.

770
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,700
What's happening?

771
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,000
He got the Jag.

772
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,600
-He walked back in the house.
-Keep working.

773
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,700
He's sleeping.

774
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:09,300
He fell asleep.
There's gonna be a change of plans.

775
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,000
Why would he do that?

776
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,600
He's bombed!

777
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,000
He finished a bottle of vodka.
It's right there.

778
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,300
I see what's weird.

779
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,100
Begleiter! What's going on?

780
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:52,300
You ought to have your
wife take a look at that.

781
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,800
-She's not home.
-Your office said you were home.

782
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:00,900
I kept calling but nobody answered,
so here I am.

783
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:06,400
The bank blocked your
guardianship account.

784
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:09,800
The officer believes
there's malfeasance.

785
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,100
The sons of bitches!

786
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,600
I went out on a limb for you.

787
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:17,800
I warned you about the girl's claims...

788
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,500
...about her accusations, because I
trusted you, as did the Bakers.

789
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,100
But if you've lied,
the courts will step in.

790
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:30,700
If they take these children,
they have no place to go.

791
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,000
He thought he was helping us.

792
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,800
Mr. Glass, where are the children?

793
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:58,200
At their music lessons.
Their piano lessons.

794
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,300
Next, I'll have to buy
them a Steinway...

795
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,500
...and the bank will say,
"Can't they play the kazoo?"

796
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:13,400
Shit!

797
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,900
That's my Testarossa.

798
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,100
No, that's our Testarossa.
Until we get our money back.

799
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,900
You planned to skip town today?

800
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,400
Where'd you get that idea?

801
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:31,300
-Your wife called us this morning.
-My wife?

802
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:39,000
Before you leave, how about repaying
the loan in one lump cash sum?

803
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,700
He doesn't have our money.

804
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,600
-What's going on, Terry?
-Ask him.

805
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,100
-Your partner?
-Bastard robbed me blind.

806
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
-Oh, my God. I'm leaving.
-No, no, no.

807
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,700
-You're not.
-Really?

808
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:58,600
-We need an explanation.
-From me?

809
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,800
I have nothing to do with this!

810
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:20,400
-Nobody listens anymore.
-Are you happy, Terry?

811
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:24,400
Feel good about that?
Terry, you're a troublemaker.

812
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:30,500
-That took care of the problem.
-No. We'll discuss this in the car.

813
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,600
There's nothing to discuss!

814
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:36,900
Just walk like a man out to the Jag.

815
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:39,600
That was the problem. You solved it.

816
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,900
The rest is pure profit.

817
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,700
Not the Jag. The Volvo.

818
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:50,200
Wait here for a minute, okay?

819
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:59,200
-Nice little drive in our car.
-No! Not in there!

820
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,600
Not in there! No! Not in there!

821
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,900
I don't even have the key!

822
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,600
We got all the keys to all the cars.

823
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,800
Take the Volvo, not the Jag!

824
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,200
-Let's go!
-Okay, you win!

825
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,800
-You win.
-It's over.

826
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,800
Just please take the Volvo, okay?

827
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,100
You're making this difficult.

828
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,400
-Whatever.
-Take the Volvo.

829
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,100
Brand loyalty. I like that.

830
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,100
That little bitch!

831
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,700
You're some kind of joker.
We'll take the Jaguar.

832
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,100
No!

833
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:46,300
You haven't been
to our Tarzana office.

834
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:49,400
We got a handball court and a sauna...

835
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:53,600
...and way in the back we have
this special room.

836
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:56,100
Totally soundproof.

837
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,200
What the--?

838
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:22,900
What the--?

839
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:15,600
What'd you do to this car?!
What'd you do to this car?!

840
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:06,000
Hi, you guys need some help?

841
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,100
Yes.

842
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:40,400
-Everything under control?
-We got it covered.

843
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,300
Terry.

844
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:07,900
You two kids stay in the car.

845
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:13,300
I have a possible T.C.
Southbound, Malibu Canyon.

846
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,600
-I'll be investigating.
-Copy that.

847
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,000
I have a rollover T.C...

848
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,800
...with one fatality.
I'll need two backup units.

849
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,400
Ruby.

850
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:29,500
It's okay.

851
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,900
Ruby, go! Drive!

852
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:39,000
-Where's the stupid key?!
-It's okay!

853
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:43,600
We're gonna die here! Let's go!
Come on, find them!

854
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Ruby!

855
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:49,500
I need your help.

856
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,000
-He's getting closer!
-I got them!

857
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:54,300
He's getting closer!

858
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,300
Drive! Drive! Drive!

859
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:05,400
Why are you stopping?!

860
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,200
It's okay, honey.

861
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,600
-Buckle up.
-What're you doing?!

862

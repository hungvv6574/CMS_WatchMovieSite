1
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:39,862
Hi.

2
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:49,942
Mom!

3
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:52,576
Please don't fucking do this.

4
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:55,989
Please don't fucking
do this. Mom. Mom.

5
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,350
I love you.

6
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,671
- I've got to go.
- No. No.

7
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:34,422
What are you doing?

8
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,014
No!

9
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:11,158
Let's go. Let's go.

10
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,919
Come on. Get up. Get up.

11
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,926
Move it. Move it.

12
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,781
Welcome to paradise boys.

13
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,655
This is Coldwater. I am
Colonel Frank Reichert.

14
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,854
United States Marine
Corps, retired.

15
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:03,606
You can call me Colonel.
You can call me sir.

16
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:06,647
It's up to you. The choice is yours.

17
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:09,909
Life here, gentlemen,
is very simple.

18
00:04:10,326 --> 00:04:14,327
Let's not bullshit each other.
You're here because you fucked up.

19
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:16,533
We're here to fix that.

20
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:21,303
So, you show me that
you have a willingness

21
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:24,405
and desire to change.

22
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,061
Simple as that.

23
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:30,999
You continue to work hard,
keep your nose clean.

24
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,351
You show a commitment to the
process, leadership capabilities.

25
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:36,950
When you've shown us
that you can handle

26
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:41,463
responsibilities beyond
your petty little selves.

27
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:45,911
Congratulations on that day.
You are now a useful citizen.

28
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,662
You can then write
your ticket out of this place.

29
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:53,653
Or you can stay, come work for me,

30
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,789
pass on what you've learned.

31
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:59,669
We take care of our own.

32
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:04,821
Let me see that watch son.

33
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,350
This watch is a lot
older than you are.

34
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:18,294
I'll hang on to this. You'll
get it back when you're ready.

35
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:22,463
Gentlemen, whatever shit
you came in here with...

36
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,325
let it go.

37
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:30,197
If it was working for you
you wouldn't be here.

38
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:34,871
Make no mistake, we
will readjust you

39
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:37,686
because we are goddamn
good at what we do.

40
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:41,143
I put my heart and my
soul into this process.

41
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:44,181
I highly recommend you do that too.

42
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,599
All right. Company
dismissed. Powell.

43
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,813
Yes sir.

44
00:05:50,295 --> 00:05:53,494
Ladies, you heard
the man. Dismissed.

45
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:11,607
Please stop!

46
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:15,349
Please no! Stop!

47
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:20,438
Please! Please, stop! No!

48
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,869
Turn around.

49
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:28,085
Strip.

50
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:41,301
Turn around and put your
hands against the wall.

51
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:59,285
Only a couple more
miles guys. Let's go!

52
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,366
Pick it up!

53
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:13,655
Get in line. Get some water.

54
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:19,829
When the mail's finished,
water break is finished.

55
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:24,150
Man, I've got to get some
fucking water. I know that shit.

56
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,165
Come on, hurry up.

57
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,597
Time's up.

58
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:41,334
Can I have some water?

59
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,349
Let's go boys.

60
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,645
Move! Move!

61
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,926
What in the hell we
digging for anyway?

62
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:54,518
- Irrigation ditches.
- Irri what?

63
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,822
Irrigation ditches.

64
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:59,509
So they can water them
fields down there.

65
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:03,478
Yeah. Okay. Man, I'm
tired as a motherfucker.

66
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,830
Shit. Ain't never hurt
nobody shoplifting.

67
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:12,821
I'm going to whip some ass after
this shit. What the hell you do?

68
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:18,390
I just caught real
high with the homies.

69
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:20,437
This nigger.

70
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:23,445
What about you?

71
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,477
Did you go cowboy on
some fools or what?

72
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,293
Lucky bastard.

73
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:02,325
Yo, Trevor. Come on man.

74
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:05,973
Pop up.

75
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:09,013
Hey, Trevor.

76
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,957
What you don't want lunch?

77
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:16,374
What the fuck? No, no, no.

78
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,798
Wait, wait. No, no. Powell! Powell!

79
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,070
Trevor what you... Powell!

80
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:25,270
Open your eyes! Open your
eyes! Up, up, up, up, up, up.

81
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:28,086
Trevor come on, come on, come on,
come on. Trevor open your eyes!

82
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:30,635
Powell! Get his arm.
Get his arm. Get his arms.

83
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,909
Come on! Come on!
Come on man! Come on!

84
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,061
Stop thinking about it.

85
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:45,557
What?

86
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:49,206
It's impossible. We're in
the middle of nowhere, man.

87
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:53,269
- Boots or no boots.
- What am I thinking about?

88
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,622
That fool Trevor made it
out a few months back.

89
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,733
Up and over the fence.

90
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:04,757
His fucking family
brought him back.

91
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:08,021
They fucked him up good for that.

92
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:11,350
Yeah. We didn't see
him for a while.

93
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,389
That's when they put a
second double down.

94
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:18,517
Now even trustee can't get out.

95
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:22,901
I don't know. I think he's got a
key hidden somewhere though.

96
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,484
How long have you been here?

97
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,901
A long fucking time.

98
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,078
What? For getting high?

99
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,501
Come on, man.

100
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,078
Just go to bed.

101
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,581
Jesus.

102
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:55,733
He's sleeping like a baby. He
must have blown his load already.

103
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,006
His parents will
get a bill if he did.

104
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:03,349
Hey, you know you
can't jerk off, right?

105
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:06,806
Come on.

106
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:09,910
You better get off me like that.

107
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:11,894
- What the fuck you doing?
- What'd I do? What'd I do?

108
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:13,942
- Go.
- What'd I do?

109
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:16,949
Shut the fuck up.

110
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:42,742
100 degrees most days.

111
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:47,158
You pass out in the dirt and
they'll just let you cook.

112
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,237
They broke you down.

113
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:53,590
If you couldn't take it
they took your privileges.

114
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:55,637
They took your sleep.

115
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,805
Still some guys like to talk tough.

116
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,622
Some guys were just fucking crazy.

117
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:02,614
You're not taking my boots.

118
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,574
Casey, put it down.
Drop the weapon.

119
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,366
You want these boots,
come and get these boots.

120
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,838
- Step back.
- Come and get them.

121
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:08,787
- Come on! Come on!
- Drop the weapon.

122
00:13:08,812 --> 00:13:11,542
I don't fucking need this.
Let's do this. Come on, let's go.

123
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:15,637
After a few weeks mostly
everyone starts to lose it.

124
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:21,461
Everyday was the same. Until
you weren't you anymore.

125
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:23,669
It was all routine.

126
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:36,790
Come on. Watch it,
watch it, watch it.

127
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,765
- Shut up.
- Ow, man.

128
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,806
You'll be back in the
barracks tonight.

129
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:11,285
I'll be coming in to check on you. You'll
be off your feet for at least a week.

130
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,509
Fine with me, man. It's a
week away from them assholes.

131
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,277
- Yo, is Manny out to lunch?
- What's up man?

132
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:31,254
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank God.

133
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:37,846
I'm telling you man if you
want that shit sold I got you.

134
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:41,110
- Just throw me a little something man.
- Put that shit away man.

135
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:42,389
Okay.

136
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:44,598
- Carburetor's flooded.
- Yeah?

137
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:48,629
- I need a... Phillips head.
- Cool. Yeah.

138
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:51,926
Oh, my God man.

139
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:53,782
So, you coming to
Holly's party tomorrow?

140
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:54,806
Oh, yeah.

141
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:56,854
- I heard she wants to rape you, dude.
- Yeah? Oh, shit man.

142
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,070
I need to get up on that.

143
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:59,254
- Yeah dude.
- Where's it at?

144
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:00,310
It's end of Highland Trail.

145
00:15:00,311 --> 00:15:01,526
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you've been there.

146
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,422
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.

147
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:06,070
Yo, B! What's up?

148
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,958
Hey, man, can I holler
at you real quick?

149
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,677
Fuck. Yo, I'll be right back.

150
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:13,974
Come on, dude. We got places to be.

151
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:15,510
Don't just show up to where I work.

152
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,909
I told you if you want to deal with
me call me like everybody else.

153
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,757
Yeah, yeah. It won't happen again.

154
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:23,349
Give me my money.

155
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:26,740
You want it give me the
money or fuck off.

156
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,805
What the fuck are
you looking at, yo?

157
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:37,845
Yo, you need to get to stepping.

158
00:15:38,358 --> 00:15:39,925
What? No?

159
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,966
What is this, huh? You come in to
my work and you fucking short me?

160
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:45,718
Chill. All right. What?
Give it back to him.

161
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,990
- You want it back? Here.
- No, no, no. I don't want it back,

162
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:50,901
but the last time I fronted you two
assholes you took your sweet ass time.

163
00:15:50,902 --> 00:15:54,133
I want the rest tomorrow
or I'm done with you.

164
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:56,694
I'm sick of this you
fucking speed freaks.

165
00:15:56,695 --> 00:16:00,374
Oh, all right. Yeah maybe we'll bring
it by that party tomorrow night, huh?

166
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,028
Where'd you say it
was? Highland Trail?

167
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:07,029
Look at this face, yo.

168
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:08,953
Shit man.

169
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:12,622
Shit what? Next time
stand up for yourself.

170
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:20,916
Jonas didn't kick at the
ATV. Powell hit him.

171
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:24,245
So, you're telling me that Powell and
my trustee are both lying to me?

172
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:28,309
Your trustee was nowhere
near us. He didn't see anything.

173
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,748
Counselor step out.

174
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:38,036
Close the door behind you.

175
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:48,148
All right, look.

176
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,846
If you make enemies in here your road is
going to be very long and a painful one.

177
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:59,541
Jonas is not a victim. Neither are
you. I want to keep it that way.

178
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:03,350
Last couple of weeks you've
shown good progress.

179
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:06,709
Keep that momentum.
That's how trust is built.

180
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:13,077
So, tell me. Can I trust you?

181
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:20,021
That a boy.

182
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:26,196
You're dismissed Lunders.

183
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:42,151
So, the stories you
write every night,

184
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:44,789
I mean do you just make
them up as you go...

185
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,918
or is it based on actual
outside experiences?

186
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:51,286
No, Brad. It's a barracks report.

187
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:55,765
So what happens outside the barracks
isn't important. So shut the fuck up.

188
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:00,789
Since we're in the barracks now you
should probably write this down.

189
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,542
You're a chicken shit
fucking weakling.

190
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:11,958
You could have protected him, but you
just go along with their bullshit lies.

191
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,844
I wish...

192
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:16,681
I wish I could get the chance
to fucking come at you...

193
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:20,789
and not have anything happen to me
because I would tear you the fuck apart.

194
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:22,869
You fucking pussy.

195
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:29,173
I'm really not surprised you're
a trustee of a place like this.

196
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,310
You're messing with me.

197
00:18:56,311 --> 00:19:00,214
- Okay. Maybe a little.
- You can tell her it was amazing.

198
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:04,565
- Yeah, you are. Better.
- Okay.

199
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,284
Hey. Hey. Behave yourself.

200
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:21,078
You're the only one
I can count on, Erin.

201
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:28,052
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

202
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:29,972
Mm-hm.

203
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:34,101
- If you start doing business there...
- No, no. I won't.

204
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,373
- Promise?
- Yeah.

205
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:38,710
- Okay. Okay.
- Trust me.

206
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:42,517
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

207
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:48,692
Bye.

208
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,431
Listen, we've given
this a lot of thought,

209
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:54,956
and I think it's time that
John came to live with us.

210
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:56,757
You guys are selling the house?

211
00:19:56,758 --> 00:20:00,693
No. We're not selling the
house. He's moving in.

212
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:04,053
I love your mother very much, Brad.
I just want to make her happy.

213
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:07,796
- Oh, shit. Here we go.
- What? Look...

214
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:11,082
- I know we've had trouble communicating...
- Wait a minute. You know what?

215
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:13,333
You've never even
given John a chance.

216
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:14,774
Yeah, well he's not
moving into this house.

217
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:17,462
Yes. He's here almost every
night already anyway.

218
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:19,692
Fine. Come and go then.
Mow his lawn.

219
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,333
Take his couch. Sleep
with his fucking wife.

220
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,445
- Whoa. That's not what this is about.
- You know what? Watch your mouth, young man.

221
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:27,061
Yeah, what kind of fucking
friend were you anyway? Huh?

222
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:29,685
Thanks for dinner.

223
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:36,826
Come on wake up time!

224
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:40,820
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Get up! Get up!

225
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:44,372
Let's go! Today.

226
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,093
Let's go.

227
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:52,886
- How's the foot?
- How you think?

228
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,133
Let's go.

229
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,342
Yeah, the fuck okay.
I can't do shit.

230
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,134
Sure you can. It's been
a week. Nothing's broke.

231
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:01,813
No, he can't. Jenson was here
yesterday. He doesn't run.

232
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:06,934
Trustee, has this inmate walked to
and from the shower by himself?

233
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:07,638
Yes, sir.

234
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:10,805
Trustee, has this inmate walked to
and from the mess hall by himself?

235
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:12,022
Yes, sir. Twice now.

236
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:16,053
In the trustee's opinion, can this
inmate take part in this morning's run?

237
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:19,574
Yes, sir. I'd recommend boots.

238
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:21,940
Everyone, fall in.

239
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:28,245
Let's go!

240
00:22:29,397 --> 00:22:31,188
Whew, man.

241
00:22:31,926 --> 00:22:34,068
Brad Lunders.

242
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:38,388
Dude be swiping maps
and first aid and shit.

243
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:43,444
I'm taking you to the doctor's
tomorrow so he can fix this up.

244
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:44,854
Then you can steal something.

245
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:47,713
Yeah, right. I don't care.
I learned my lesson.

246
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:48,973
Shit.

247
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:54,324
I don't know how much my dad paid, but I
fucking hate him for sending me here.

248
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:57,396
What about your mom?

249
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:03,919
Well, she don't know where I am.

250
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,645
Mom fucking split, I was like 10.

251
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:09,910
I don't think my dad would be
that proud of me right now.

252
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:12,404
I wouldn't be here
I know that much.

253
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,564
I'd rather be in juvie.

254
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,340
At least I know when
I'm getting out.

255
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:23,956
At least I could call someone.

256
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:28,662
At least I'd know when I'd
be hitting it again, baby.

257
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:34,901
Man, you got a girl
waiting on you back home?

258
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:37,876
I had a girlfriend.

259
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:41,300
- Pretty?
- Yeah, man.

260
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:45,908
She was... beautiful.

261
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:49,077
What? She break up with you?

262
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:13,557
How about some more of your stash?

263
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:15,542
Got bills to pay too motherfucker.

264
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:18,292
- This is from today?
- Today.

265
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,492
Shit. Maybe.

266
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,565
Hey, motherfucker. Don't I know you?

267
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:25,302
What the fuck?

268
00:24:25,303 --> 00:24:26,325
I know you from...

269
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:29,365
- Get the fuck out of my face, man.
- What the fuck?

270
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:32,821
Get the fuck out. What?
What? What? Roll boy.

271
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:35,701
I don't fucking know you bitch.

272
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:39,284
See I don't take any shit.

273
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:43,925
Hey. Look me in the
eyes and say it.

274
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:48,597
I said I won't take nothing
from nobody. Ever.

275
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,300
You need a fucking drink.

276
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,948
Better go talk to Erin, fool.

277
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:59,957
She's been looking for
you all pissed and shit.

278
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:05,652
Don't look. She's behind you. She's coming.
I'm going to talk to Holly. All right?

279
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:08,569
- Hey.
- You're an asshole.

280
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,934
Where were you? I've
been calling you all day.

281
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:14,836
Just been dealing with
some bullshit. Come here.

282
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:18,036
Come here. I need to talk to you.

283
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:28,885
- So, you did get fired?
- Yes.

284
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:30,403
And Gabriel got fired.

285
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,164
We both got fired.
Got caught dealing.

286
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:36,117
- What's the money for?
- What money Erin?

287
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,182
The money I saw Gabriel give
you outside. What was it for?

288
00:25:39,183 --> 00:25:40,565
So, you're spying on me now?

289
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:42,244
What does he owe you
money for Brad?

290
00:25:42,244 --> 00:25:44,726
- Is Gabriel dealing for you?
- I'm not doing this.

291
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:46,421
We're having this conversation.

292
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:48,789
Gabe does what he wants to.
Get off my fucking back.

293
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,933
I told you. He's not going
to be dealing for me.

294
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:54,677
Fine. How are you going
to get him to stop now?

295
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,334
- Are you fucking...
- No, I'm not kidding.

296
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,901
What are you going to do when your
probation officer talks to your boss?

297
00:25:58,902 --> 00:26:00,053
- Seriously?
- I don't know!

298
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:02,293
I don't know what I'm going
to do. I can't go back to juvie.

299
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:07,028
I can't stay here. And I can't
leave. I can't get out of here.

300
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:10,485
You can fucking get out
by yourself. Just go.

301
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,948
Just go! If you want to...

302
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:21,237
Hey, you guys need to
leave. I think it's time...

303
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:23,093
Fuck you bitch. Get
the fuck out of here.

304
00:26:23,094 --> 00:26:26,389
- Get the fuck out of here before...
- Yo, Eddie. What's up dude?

305
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:36,500
Fucker.

306
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:43,669
Piece of shit.

307
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,396
Fucker!

308
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,828
You fucking bitch!

309
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:52,564
Hey! Brad! Stop it! Stop it!

310
00:26:52,629 --> 00:26:54,325
Get off of him! Stop it.

311
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:58,675
- What's up now motherfucker?
- What the fuck are you doing? Stop!

312
00:26:58,806 --> 00:27:01,237
- He's got a gun.
- You want to fight motherfucker?

313
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:03,157
You want to go bitch?

314
00:27:03,158 --> 00:27:07,605
No! Erin!

315
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:10,004
Why?

316
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:17,236
Erin! No!

317
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:26,997
Get some help. Please get
some fucking help! Erin!

318
00:27:29,141 --> 00:27:31,157
God fucking damnit!

319
00:27:55,957 --> 00:27:58,051
Whoa. Damn.

320
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:02,964
That's fucked up, man.
That's some hard shit.

321
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:11,028
Well, we ain't going to accomplish
anything in this motherfucker.

322
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:14,773
These counselors are a
bunch of tools, homie.

323
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:18,005
You will leave Coldwater
Ranch a responsible adult.

324
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:20,757
Hey, you guys. Shut the fuck up.

325
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:29,268
25 miles, man. That's it.

326
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:34,484
Might be here a while first.

327
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:40,948
So, I got your back.

328
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:08,213
Get up! Move! Move!

329
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,869
Get up! Move it! Move it! Move it!

330
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,605
Get up!

331
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:18,037
- Explain this.
- It's for his ankle. It's infected.

332
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:22,291
I told you I snagged it from the
doc after he fixed my foot.

333
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,791
And I suppose you're
going to use this...

334
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,037
as a bandage?

335
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:33,702
Look, I fucking took that.
Okay? I took that.

336
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:36,460
It was me. He had
nothing to do with it.

337
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,708
Hm.

338
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:43,061
Double runs everyone.
Next two days.

339
00:29:43,062 --> 00:29:45,812
And no downtime for a week.

340
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:48,948
These two get another
day to reflect.

341
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:51,508
Don't forget the lights.

342
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:55,540
Get the fuck out of here.

343
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:02,389
Little bitch.

344
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:19,924
Hey, Brad.

345
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:27,156
Brad, you awake? Brad.

346
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:41,940
Fucking nigger cripple.

347
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:45,205
Turn.

348
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:48,405
Jonas!

349
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:49,621
Shut the fuck up.

350
00:31:03,317 --> 00:31:08,212
My leg hurts so bad.

351
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:13,908
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take this.

352
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:20,789
Help!

353
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,924
Let us the fuck out of here.

354
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:27,829
Yeah. Yeah. I can still escape.
What are you talking about?

355
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,069
Yeah, I'll be there. Absolutely.

356
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,804
Hey, Brownie! Brownie I've got a...
I'll call you back all right?

357
00:32:44,817 --> 00:32:46,831
Come on.

358
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:01,173
Angie it was an accident.
It's right there on the report.

359
00:33:01,174 --> 00:33:04,597
You've talked to everybody and we are
dealing with the individuals involved.

360
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:06,709
He lost the whole
fucking leg, Frank.

361
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,780
I know that, but we did
it by the numbers here.

362
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:12,947
He was injured. He was
treated, monitored,

363
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:15,733
- ...there was follow up care.
- The bruising on his neck.

364
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:17,333
That happened in the barracks.

365
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:19,957
- That's an entirely separate situation.
- And his testimony.

366
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:23,028
You've got Lunders' testimony.

367
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:27,636
Your counselor is lying
and I think you know it.

368
00:33:27,764 --> 00:33:31,220
I've got to tell you. You've
got a big fight coming up.

369
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:34,228
You put me in a bad place, Frank.

370
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,117
All right, Mr. Reichert,

371
00:33:36,118 --> 00:33:40,947
I forgot to ask you how do the inmates
get out of the barracks in an emergency?

372
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:46,517
Oh, there's a hidden key. The
trustees have access to it.

373
00:33:46,517 --> 00:33:49,108
A hidden key. Okay.

374
00:33:51,252 --> 00:33:52,979
Which trustees?

375
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:57,267
- All of them.
- All of them. Okay.

376
00:34:01,716 --> 00:34:03,413
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

377
00:34:03,414 --> 00:34:05,684
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- You are a fucking virus.

378
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:08,576
I wouldn't even make you a
fucking trustee right now.

379
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:11,797
I want you off my campus.
Go. You're fired.

380
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:12,852
Don't do this.

381
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:15,541
Don't fucking tell me don't do
this. Get the fuck out of here.

382
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:19,187
You have ten minutes. Pack
your shit and get out.

383
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:37,971
Hey.

384
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:40,807
Do you know what they're going
to do to us in the morning

385
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:42,723
when they see that you're gone?

386
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:49,075
That's if they don't pull a surprise
count. The next one's in four hours.

387
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,660
No.

388
00:35:56,148 --> 00:35:59,572
You better make it worth our
while and get away with it then.

389
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:32,436
Key.

390
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:43,316
Level three.

391
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:50,740
He's gone. Must have used
something to get over the fence.

392
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:19,315
Hey. You all right?

393
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:37,619
You have no idea how
good this is right now.

394
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:46,451
Come on. This way.

395
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,643
Uh, Brad, this is Deputy Cross.

396
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:51,956
Hi Brad.

397
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:53,332
He's going to help you.

398
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:58,164
I told him your story and I really think
that you should be talking to him.

399
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:02,292
Everything's going to be fine.

400
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,996
You all right?

401
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:36,404
I'm sorry, but I have
to take you back.

402
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:40,771
Maybe if you had some
sort of evidence,

403
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:44,108
proof to back up your story
things might be different.

404
00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:13,043
I want you to have
this. It was my dad's.

405
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:16,819
It's yours now.

406
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:21,268
Are you serious?

407
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:58,963
Thanks Deputy. You give
the Sheriff my best now.

408
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:06,868
All we ask of you is hard work, respect
and the willingness to change.

409
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:09,267
This young man failed at all three.

410
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:14,675
Now, he could be any one
of you. So, what do I do?

411
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:16,915
Do I just give up on him?

412
00:41:17,524 --> 00:41:22,355
Do I send him away
like his parents did?

413
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:26,580
No.

414
00:41:27,636 --> 00:41:32,627
We are in the business
of transformation.

415
00:41:33,044 --> 00:41:35,603
That means I am patient.

416
00:41:35,637 --> 00:41:40,691
It also means that he must be
held accountable for his actions.

417
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:47,763
Take off your clothes son.

418
00:41:48,852 --> 00:41:50,579
What?

419
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:56,819
Take your clothes off.

420
00:42:46,548 --> 00:42:49,138
Stop. Please.

421
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,650
Open your mouth.

422
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:39,443
Open your mouth. Eat the fish.

423
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:42,163
- You eat that shit.
- Shut the fuck up.

424
00:43:42,773 --> 00:43:46,387
Eat the goddamn fish.
Eat the fucking fi...

425
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,131
Come on. Let's go.

426
00:44:47,412 --> 00:44:48,787
Get up.

427
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:50,579
Stay there.

428
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,227
The bastards just keep
on coming don't they?

429
00:45:01,652 --> 00:45:03,507
You're on E.

430
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,596
What happened to your family?

431
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,762
Wife ran off with the
fucking yoga teacher.

432
00:45:20,116 --> 00:45:21,778
Kid...

433
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:26,123
put a bullet in his own head,
end of his second tour.

434
00:45:31,444 --> 00:45:36,563
You got what it takes kid. You're
going to be wearing blue real soon.

435
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:47,764
What the fuck?

436
00:45:47,764 --> 00:45:53,899
What the fuck are you? What are you the
fucking Gerber fucking baby, boy? Huh?

437
00:45:54,837 --> 00:45:56,212
What's your name son?

438
00:45:56,213 --> 00:45:59,284
- Billy Heckler, sir.
- Billy Heckler, sir.

439
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:03,603
You got tits, man.

440
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:08,659
What are you in for?

441
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,996
- Bad grades and ditching.
- Ditching?

442
00:46:10,997 --> 00:46:16,755
Ooh! Gerber's a bad ass.
Ditched a class.

443
00:46:16,756 --> 00:46:21,331
They're going to love you
Gerber. Fucking Gerber.

444
00:46:23,316 --> 00:46:26,323
Oh, it's funny, huh?
It's fucking funny.

445
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:30,196
Where you from?
Huh, where you from?

446
00:46:30,197 --> 00:46:32,979
- Plymouth.
- Plymouth, ooh.

447
00:46:34,228 --> 00:46:36,979
Yeah, one of them
religious pricks, huh?

448
00:46:42,612 --> 00:46:45,683
Guess it never answers
your prayers, huh?

449
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,363
What the fuck? Get them
the fuck out of here.

450
00:46:54,548 --> 00:46:55,636
Holy shit. Brad.

451
00:46:55,637 --> 00:46:57,971
Either of you know engines?

452
00:46:59,604 --> 00:47:01,971
Yeah, yeah. I know a little.

453
00:47:02,772 --> 00:47:04,371
Let's go.

454
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:07,116
How long has it been, man?

455
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:10,284
It feels like fucking
forever, dog. Come here.

456
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:13,427
Fill the tank.

457
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,739
All right.

458
00:47:15,604 --> 00:47:20,147
Whew. Fucking... I can't
believe it's you, man.

459
00:47:22,164 --> 00:47:25,364
It's like you were dead, man. Your
mom didn't tell anyone anything.

460
00:47:25,365 --> 00:47:26,612
What are you doing here?

461
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:29,716
Couple of months went by, man,
I got busted for some stash.

462
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:32,212
You know, I was in
juvie almost nine.

463
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:36,052
Fucking this morning State social
worker doesn't like me, man.

464
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:37,492
You know what she
tells my parents...

465
00:47:37,493 --> 00:47:41,587
Listen, hey. She tells
them too much fighting.

466
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:46,740
No change of behavior. Only a
matter of time before state time.

467
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:49,875
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. All that shit.

468
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,795
Guess our moms are
still talking, huh?

469
00:47:56,596 --> 00:47:59,091
She'll get a discount now.

470
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:04,051
What's up with you, man?
What's wrong, fool?

471
00:48:04,724 --> 00:48:07,154
What are you doing here Gabe?

472
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:13,074
After everything that happened,
why are you here right now?

473
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:16,787
Nice to see you too.

474
00:48:17,363 --> 00:48:19,732
What do you want me to
fucking say to you Gabe?

475
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:21,684
- Do you know where the fuck you are?
- Oh, please. I ain't like I was...

476
00:48:21,685 --> 00:48:26,219
back in the day, little bitch and
shit. Yo, I'm down now. I swear.

477
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:31,412
How about you? They
letting your ass out soon?

478
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:34,739
- Soon.
- Okay, well how long's soon?

479
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:40,596
Oh, I see. You're moving
up in the world, huh?

480
00:48:40,597 --> 00:48:42,900
I'm a trustee. It keeps
them off my back.

481
00:48:42,901 --> 00:48:45,715
Man, you a trustee?

482
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,099
You been out in these
weeds all this time, huh?

483
00:48:53,172 --> 00:48:56,916
I thought those assholes in the van were
bad. Man, that Colonel is off his rocker.

484
00:48:56,917 --> 00:49:00,564
It doesn't matter what I say. You
don't fucking get it. This isn't juvie.

485
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:04,692
This isn't some drug deal on the
corner. This is something else.

486
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:07,220
All right. What the fuck do
you think I'm going to do?

487
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:11,123
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

488
00:49:14,132 --> 00:49:17,554
- You got something to say, inmate?
- No, sir.

489
00:49:17,684 --> 00:49:21,330
- If I did I would have said it.
- Hey, finish up.

490
00:49:22,676 --> 00:49:24,275
Good.

491
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:29,556
Lunders, what crimes
did you commit?

492
00:49:29,557 --> 00:49:32,884
Underage drinking, battery and
violation of probation, sir.

493
00:49:32,885 --> 00:49:35,156
What are you going to do
about that Mr. Lunders?

494
00:49:35,157 --> 00:49:36,948
I'm learning to be
a better citizen.

495
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:41,043
So when I return to mainstream society
I can function as a responsible adult.

496
00:49:47,092 --> 00:49:50,483
All right. Let's go. Let's go.

497
00:49:55,508 --> 00:49:57,492
Come on Lunders. What the fuck?

498
00:49:57,493 --> 00:49:59,538
You look tired.

499
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,418
What the fuck's he doing?

500
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:05,733
I think he's...

501
00:50:07,388 --> 00:50:09,844
probably waiting on
his boyfriend. Right?

502
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:14,099
I think so. I think so.

503
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:21,837
Sorry.

504
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:27,603
- You want some?
- That sucks.

505
00:50:28,147 --> 00:50:31,187
There's a little bit
left if you want some.

506
00:50:35,252 --> 00:50:38,291
Pick it up girls. Come on.

507
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,226
You know Holly and I were
together for a while before juvie.

508
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,548
She got knocked up
by some white boy.

509
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:48,179
Oh, good.

510
00:50:52,691 --> 00:50:56,018
Yeah, it's pretty
fucked up sometimes.

511
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,851
I mean I think about
that night a lot.

512
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:07,636
Used to see her parents around town once
in a while too. They hardly looked at me.

513
00:51:07,637 --> 00:51:10,867
You're not going to do
this right now, are you?

514
00:51:26,836 --> 00:51:29,010
Colonel wants a word with you.

515
00:51:29,428 --> 00:51:31,954
What the fuck? Right now?

516
00:52:09,683 --> 00:52:11,891
They want you with the others.

517
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:18,580
If you can't do it I can probably bullshit
you into the infirmary for a few hours.

518
00:52:18,581 --> 00:52:22,100
- I'll tell Jenson it's dehydration.
- Get these fucking handcuffs off.

519
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:27,219
Listen, a kid lost his
fucking leg here last year.

520
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,396
There's a big lawsuit and
this place is going to shit.

521
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:35,154
So, until they pull the fucking plug you
have to play along or I can't help you.

522
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:37,427
You won't be here long.

523
00:52:38,036 --> 00:52:40,915
Yeah, well you know what? I can
fucking take care of myself.

524
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:43,858
Good, then fucking
take care of yourself.

525
00:52:59,764 --> 00:53:01,651
Did you check his papers Josh?

526
00:53:01,652 --> 00:53:05,524
Who Nunez? No, I did
not check his papers.

527
00:53:05,525 --> 00:53:07,058
I will ask him.

528
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:13,587
Good job. I'm sorry.

529
00:53:18,836 --> 00:53:21,428
What the fuck? You got a fucking
death wish motherfucker?

530
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:24,308
- I'll take care of it. I'll handle it.
- Yeah, you handle it.

531
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:26,195
You fucking handle it over there.
You handle your little boyfriend.

532
00:53:26,196 --> 00:53:28,979
- You know what you're a lot of talk.
- Oh, yeah? I'm a lot of talk?

533
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,228
Yeah, fuck you. Fuck you.

534
00:53:30,229 --> 00:53:33,396
If it was up to me I'd treat you like
the fucking pussy you are and I'd take

535
00:53:33,397 --> 00:53:36,724
that armband off you and I'd beat you
down like all your fucking friends.

536
00:53:36,724 --> 00:53:38,420
Yeah, fuck you. I'm not
going to cry about it.

537
00:53:38,421 --> 00:53:41,203
I'm going to beat the shit out
of you. You fucking piece of shit.

538
00:53:41,204 --> 00:53:43,156
- Let's go.
- Fuck you. Let's go.

539
00:53:43,157 --> 00:53:46,323
I got you Josh.
Clock this motherfucker.

540
00:53:49,395 --> 00:53:50,675
Come on!

541
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:53,138
Let's go!

542
00:53:57,364 --> 00:53:59,987
- Get up Josh.
- Come on. Come on.

543
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:05,298
Get in there. Get up.
Get up. Come on.

544
00:54:15,796 --> 00:54:17,491
Stay down.

545
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,146
- Josh...
- Come on. He's done. Walk with me.

546
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:42,611
Fuck!

547
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,868
Come on you fat fucks. Move it.

548
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:16,147
Do not let me fucking catch you.

549
00:55:19,156 --> 00:55:23,475
What you looking at, huh? What the
fuck you looking at? Stupid fuck!

550
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,419
Up that fucking hill! Move! Move!

551
00:55:32,244 --> 00:55:33,747
What the...

552
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,380
What the fuck?

553
00:55:41,715 --> 00:55:42,866
Bitch.

554
00:55:46,419 --> 00:55:48,564
- You fucking finished yet?
- Yes, sir.

555
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:54,707
Then why the fuck won't it work?

556
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:57,651
I don't know, sir.
The tank's topped off.

557
00:56:09,043 --> 00:56:14,131
It's water. It's fucking water.
That's why it won't fucking work.

558
00:56:24,852 --> 00:56:29,684
Who the fuck did this? Don't
tell me you don't fucking know!

559
00:56:29,684 --> 00:56:33,234
I will bust you down
to fucking level one.

560
00:56:35,827 --> 00:56:41,042
You want to fuck with me? Huh?
I'll rip you a new fucking asshole.

561
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,908
No more privileges. No more downtime.
Now push that piece of shit

562
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:48,627
back to the fucking garage
where the fuck it belongs.

563
00:56:48,628 --> 00:56:51,154
You can thank your
trustee for that.

564
00:56:51,924 --> 00:56:56,211
I want to know who the fuck
did this. Is that fucking clear?

565
00:56:56,339 --> 00:56:58,066
Yes, sir.

566
00:56:59,252 --> 00:57:02,739
Why the fuck are you standing there?
Get the fuck out of my way.

567
00:57:04,148 --> 00:57:07,090
Move it! Fucking move it now!

568
00:57:22,963 --> 00:57:24,946
Watch it. Watch it.

569
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,074
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

570
00:57:29,492 --> 00:57:32,082
Pick him up. There we go.

571
00:57:33,139 --> 00:57:36,190
All right. Well.

572
00:57:36,215 --> 00:57:41,195
Let's go. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

573
00:57:41,523 --> 00:57:43,026
Let's go, Brad.

574
00:58:22,003 --> 00:58:24,430
Look if you don't fess up to
putting water in the tank

575
00:58:24,455 --> 00:58:28,114
everyone of these kids are going to
be gunning for you in the barracks.

576
00:58:31,828 --> 00:58:35,378
Fuck 'em. They're animals.

577
00:58:39,252 --> 00:58:42,866
- You going to die me out?
- I won't have to.

578
00:58:44,883 --> 00:58:47,218
They're not stupid.

579
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,355
Besides, why do you
think they haven't yet?

580
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:55,538
Wow. Go on.

581
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:59,827
Don't do me any favors big
bro. I can handle my shit.

582
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,618
Fuck you then.

583
00:59:07,987 --> 00:59:09,778
Fine.

584
00:59:11,732 --> 00:59:14,003
Pick up your goddamn tray!

585
00:59:19,507 --> 00:59:21,554
All right listen up.

586
00:59:23,412 --> 00:59:26,226
Your trustee has got something
he wants to tell you.

587
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:31,891
It's better if it comes from you.

588
00:59:37,203 --> 00:59:40,466
Gabriel filled the gas tank
with water yesterday.

589
00:59:41,683 --> 00:59:43,667
He's confessed.

590
00:59:47,827 --> 00:59:53,299
All right. The trustee just showed
you what progress looks like.

591
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:58,675
He's leaving all that Plymouth,
homeboy bullshit behind him.

592
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:03,763
Nunez I suggest you follow
in your friend's footsteps.

593
01:00:03,764 --> 01:00:05,971
He ain't my motherfucking
friend, man.

594
01:00:05,972 --> 01:00:10,100
Does anybody actually know he's here for
killing his girlfriend? Anybody know that?

595
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:12,116
- It's a lot worse than that.
- Oh, it's a lot worse than that?

596
01:00:12,117 --> 01:00:13,331
Well, why don't you tell
them why you're here. Huh?

597
01:00:13,332 --> 01:00:15,027
Fuck man. I thought
you were my brother.

598
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,524
Yeah, well. That's
where you fucked up.

599
01:00:17,525 --> 01:00:18,899
That's where I fucked up?

600
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,308
- That's where I fucked up? Huh?
- Yeah, you fucked up.

601
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:23,603
That's where I fucked
up, huh? Fucked up, huh?

602
01:00:23,604 --> 01:00:26,483
Yeah, listen to your boss, man.
Listen to your fucking boss.

603
01:00:26,484 --> 01:00:28,466
Yeah, keep walking.

604
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:34,290
Don't even fucking move.

605
01:00:40,499 --> 01:00:42,028
All right.

606
01:00:42,532 --> 01:00:45,962
We make mistakes.
That's why we're here.

607
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:52,563
Here's something funny. Somebody
stole my master key yesterday.

608
01:00:52,564 --> 01:00:55,826
I am pretty fucking
sure it was you.

609
01:00:57,044 --> 01:01:00,082
- What's up? Hm?
- What's up?

610
01:01:01,427 --> 01:01:03,666
Oh, you're going to find out.

611
01:01:17,396 --> 01:01:18,866
Oh, no.

612
01:01:28,723 --> 01:01:30,418
One last time.

613
01:01:31,315 --> 01:01:33,363
Where is my key?

614
01:01:33,587 --> 01:01:35,284
I didn't take your
fucking key, man.

615
01:01:35,284 --> 01:01:38,515
I don't know what fucking key
you're talking about. Okay?

616
01:01:40,979 --> 01:01:42,386
Hm.

617
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:47,090
What fucking key? I don't know what
fucking key you're talking about, man.

618
01:01:48,499 --> 01:01:49,395
What I...

619
01:01:49,396 --> 01:01:51,987
Get the fuck off me.

620
01:01:51,988 --> 01:01:55,251
Come on. Stay still.

621
01:01:55,252 --> 01:01:56,563
Stop it!

622
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:14,483
Please! Please! I didn't take
your fucking key! Please, please.

623
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:17,363
I didn't take your fucking
key. I swear to God!

624
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:20,947
Come on!

625
01:02:24,564 --> 01:02:25,938
That's enough.

626
01:03:35,859 --> 01:03:38,419
Oh, what the fuck is this?

627
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,386
What happened to him?

628
01:04:15,475 --> 01:04:17,426
Let's get you something to eat.

629
01:04:32,563 --> 01:04:36,338
Yo! Yeah you going to let
him fool you guys too?

630
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,891
You know what? You make me fucking sick
coming in here marking your clipboards,

631
01:04:39,892 --> 01:04:41,843
wearing your suits, backing
up to this son of a bitch.

632
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:45,747
You ain't any better than him. Waddle,
waddle. You got something to say old man?

633
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:46,291
Gabriel!

634
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:49,459
Yeah, that's right. Get the fuck out
of here pencil-pushing motherfuckers.

635
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,515
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

636
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:53,043
They won't say shit because the minute
you leave they'll get beat for it.

637
01:04:53,044 --> 01:04:55,635
- Get the fuck out of here.
- You're digging your own fucking grave.

638
01:04:55,636 --> 01:04:57,939
This is it right here.

639
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,906
Fuck you. Get the fuck out
of here. Keep walking.

640
01:05:02,515 --> 01:05:03,955
Get off me!

641
01:05:42,963 --> 01:05:45,425
There's a hearing next week.

642
01:05:46,867 --> 01:05:51,666
You called them didn't
you? Jesus Christ.

643
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:55,570
I should have let you
kill yourself Jenson.

644
01:05:56,019 --> 01:06:00,818
That way you could just die on
your own terms, on your own time.

645
01:06:01,107 --> 01:06:06,802
Nope. I couldn't let you hit bottom.
Could I? Had to give you responsibility.

646
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:09,554
Guess what?

647
01:06:09,555 --> 01:06:14,779
All this, everything
that's kept you alive...

648
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:18,641
is going away, man. It's gone.

649
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:23,474
There's not a goddamn thing you
can do about it. You are fucked.

650
01:06:23,539 --> 01:06:28,179
I'm fucked. At least I can rebuild.
I mean I'm going to start again.

651
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:33,267
I've got guys who want it,
got their shit together.

652
01:06:33,268 --> 01:06:38,385
Not guys fucked up like you.
You catatonic, broken prick.

653
01:06:38,387 --> 01:06:40,307
We're done. Got that?

654
01:06:40,308 --> 01:06:43,423
So that means you can steal
all the syringes you want,

655
01:06:43,448 --> 01:06:47,350
all the meds. Take 'em all.
I don't really give a fuck anymore.

656
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:50,395
Really. I don't care.

657
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:55,241
All I want are my medical files
and your keys on my desk.

658
01:06:59,314 --> 01:07:00,977
You're on your own.

659
01:07:29,971 --> 01:07:32,466
- The doc needs to see me.
- Stop, stop, stop.

660
01:07:33,427 --> 01:07:35,730
He'll let me back in. Don't worry.

661
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,313
They're going to kill you
if you stay here, OK?

662
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:18,931
I need you to jump the fence and get
to Lincoln. It's 25 miles from here.

663
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:20,403
When you get there go
to the Sheriff's office

664
01:08:20,404 --> 01:08:23,634
and ask for Deputy Cross
and give him this. It's...

665
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:25,811
It's your medical file. It's
all of doc's patchwork.

666
01:08:25,812 --> 01:08:28,339
I wrote everything that
happened to you on the back.

667
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,994
They're not going to
send you back with this.

668
01:08:31,282 --> 01:08:33,714
Get it to them. It's
25 miles, say it.

669
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:37,299
Gabe, 25 miles. I need
you to say it. 25 miles.

670
01:08:37,299 --> 01:08:39,827
Yeah, okay. 25 miles. I got it.

671
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:42,226
Good. You can do this.

672
01:08:42,931 --> 01:08:44,562
Yeah, I can make it.

673
01:08:57,394 --> 01:09:00,594
- Hey, where'd you get this?
- Just take it.

674
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:03,153
It's yours.

675
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:11,538
I'm sorry.

676
01:09:24,467 --> 01:09:26,258
What are you going to do?

677
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:31,250
I'll be fine. You should go though.

678
01:09:49,139 --> 01:09:51,089
I don't know.

679
01:09:51,762 --> 01:09:56,337
If those guys hadn't heard us talking
under the car about Holly's party...

680
01:09:57,747 --> 01:10:00,241
none of this would have happened.

681
01:10:03,923 --> 01:10:05,553
Maybe.

682
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:08,849
I'll see you Gabe.

683
01:10:39,314 --> 01:10:43,026
Jenson. Jenson.

684
01:11:45,587 --> 01:11:47,409
What the fuck?

685
01:11:48,435 --> 01:11:50,130
Jenson?

686
01:11:54,258 --> 01:11:55,699
Hey, this is Josh in the infirmary.

687
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,282
You guys have to get over
here right now. Fuck.

688
01:12:02,163 --> 01:12:05,873
Colonel, what's your 20?
Colonel? Come in.

689
01:12:50,482 --> 01:12:52,178
Help!

690
01:12:54,482 --> 01:12:58,034
You've got to come to the infirmary!
Right now. Come on! Come on!

691
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:23,602
...not responding. Lunders!

692
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:28,785
Lunders. Sorry, my
radio was turned off.

693
01:13:30,162 --> 01:13:32,625
Where are you right now?

694
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:38,354
I'm in the barracks. Where
the fuck do you think I am?

695
01:13:41,426 --> 01:13:44,018
Who let you back in the barracks?

696
01:13:52,211 --> 01:13:53,874
Jenson.

697
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:00,593
10-4.

698
01:14:30,514 --> 01:14:32,167
All right.

699
01:14:33,823 --> 01:14:37,331
You all know Gabriel is AWOL.
The authorities have been notified

700
01:14:37,332 --> 01:14:41,585
so until the end of the day you're
confined to your barracks. I'm sorry.

701
01:14:42,418 --> 01:14:44,050
Now...

702
01:14:46,664 --> 01:14:50,313
Dr. Jenson was found dead in
his office earlier this morning.

703
01:14:52,146 --> 01:14:53,299
The Sheriff's Department
is on its way.

704
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,538
So, I don't really know
if there's anything else...

705
01:14:55,539 --> 01:15:02,320
It appears Mr. Jenson put
himself out of his own misery.

706
01:15:03,538 --> 01:15:09,650
Now, if one of you gentlemen
broke in and killed him, fine.

707
01:15:09,651 --> 01:15:14,963
Medical files have gone missing.
Those are Coldwater property.

708
01:15:14,963 --> 01:15:19,635
If I don't have them back by sundown
I will kill each and every one of you.

709
01:15:19,636 --> 01:15:22,993
- Get them inside.
- Come on. Let's go.

710
01:15:27,538 --> 01:15:30,193
Gabriel was sneaky wasn't he?

711
01:15:32,178 --> 01:15:34,322
Sneaky with the counselors.

712
01:15:34,706 --> 01:15:39,218
Sneaky with that gas
thing, the truck.

713
01:15:41,202 --> 01:15:44,325
See, here's the thing
that I don't understand

714
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:48,585
is how did he get down
off that crossbeam?

715
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:53,329
I don't know.

716
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:04,401
Ain't that a bitch.

717
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:23,987
Dispatch to Morgan. You still
at the Coldwater compound?

718
01:16:23,988 --> 01:16:24,914
10-9.

719
01:16:31,826 --> 01:16:34,224
Copy that. I'm on my way.

720
01:16:44,882 --> 01:16:46,897
Use long-range recon.

721
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:51,218
All right. Let me get back to you.

722
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:58,002
Sir... they found a body on
the side of the forest road.

723
01:16:58,003 --> 01:17:02,993
Male, possibly Hispanic,
15-17 years old,

724
01:17:03,058 --> 01:17:07,313
red t-shirt, blue jeans.
Looks like one of yours.

725
01:17:07,314 --> 01:17:11,312
We're going to need you and another
witness to identify the body.

726
01:17:51,314 --> 01:17:54,482
There was blunt head
and facial trauma.

727
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:58,610
Probable broken neck from falling
head first after he crossed the road.

728
01:17:58,611 --> 01:18:00,922
It was dark. The forest
road had no light and...

729
01:18:00,946 --> 01:18:03,401
there's a steep drop
where he crossed.

730
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:11,314
All other wounds and
injuries are accounted

731
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:14,034
for in the medical file you
supplied Gabriel with.

732
01:18:14,035 --> 01:18:16,433
Along with your written testimony.

733
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:20,657
The only real backup
for your story so far.

734
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:26,513
So, at this point you had no idea what was
going on at the ranch while you were gone.

735
01:18:35,122 --> 01:18:36,690
What the fuck, man?

736
01:18:44,626 --> 01:18:46,578
Fuck you!

737
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:59,698
How about now? How about now?

738
01:18:59,699 --> 01:19:04,113
Huh? Hoorah motherfucker. Yeah!

739
01:19:14,898 --> 01:19:19,313
Fuck, Colonel you need to
come in right now! Fuck!

740
01:19:50,482 --> 01:19:54,033
Okay. Okay. Okay.

741
01:19:55,281 --> 01:19:59,570
You guys need to listen to me.
Just look at me. Look at me.

742
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:05,744
I'm not going to tell anybody.
I'm not going to tell anybody.

743
01:20:08,243 --> 01:20:10,001
I just want to go home.

744
01:20:10,482 --> 01:20:13,618
Listen to me! All right?
You need to let me go.

745
01:20:13,619 --> 01:20:17,777
This isn't me and this isn't fair.
You need to let me go.

746
01:20:18,738 --> 01:20:20,529
I'm not going to tell anybody.

747
01:20:21,522 --> 01:20:24,562
Stop it! Stop it!

748
01:20:30,418 --> 01:20:35,473
Who's got the pickax now
motherfucker? Who wants it?

749
01:21:00,306 --> 01:21:04,561
So, you get back to the ranch, with
the Colonel. You saw what happened.

750
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:17,906
The Colonel retires to
his office. Then what?

751
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:20,081
I heard a shot.

752
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:28,369
Anything else?

753
01:21:28,402 --> 01:21:30,833
I called Lincoln Sheriff's office.

754
01:21:30,962 --> 01:21:34,928
Listen... can I get
some water, please?

755
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,569
Sure.

756
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:46,096
His mom's here.

757
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:53,360
Honey!

758
01:21:56,082 --> 01:21:58,674
I'm so sorry.

759
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:03,889
I love you so much.
I love you so much, honey.

760
01:22:04,945 --> 01:22:08,945
I'm so sorry about Gabriel.
I can't even believe it.

761
01:22:15,986 --> 01:22:17,713
Brad!

762
01:22:57,970 --> 01:22:59,920
No, sir. Not right now.

763
01:22:59,921 --> 01:23:03,825
Yeah, I'm waiting to hear back from them.
They've got a real mess on their hands.

764
01:23:07,442 --> 01:23:09,681
Let me call you back. All right?

765
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:14,919
It was late afternoon yesterday,
several inmates who either witnessed

766
01:23:14,944 --> 01:23:17,650
or notified authorities of the
murders were brought in...

767
01:23:17,651 --> 01:23:19,665
You believe this shit?

768
01:23:20,786 --> 01:23:23,602
Below you're looking at one of the
inmates from the facility right now.

769
01:23:23,603 --> 01:23:27,954
It's my understanding that there are about
two dozen officers surrounding him.

770
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,986
Caught four more
outside Lincoln County.

771
01:23:31,987 --> 01:23:34,545
What do you think
of Lunder's story?

772
01:23:35,058 --> 01:23:39,024
- He left a lot out.
- That's for sure.

773
01:23:39,794 --> 01:23:42,385
Lincoln County Sheriff's here.

774
01:25:01,841 --> 01:25:06,257
It's going to be pretty crazy for a
while with the media. All right?

775
01:25:06,962 --> 01:25:10,097
I'm taking you to
another facility first.

776
01:25:28,914 --> 01:25:34,194
Sir... they found a body
on the side of forest road.

777
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:38,897
Male, possibly Hispanic,
15-17 years old.

778
01:25:38,898 --> 01:25:43,537
Red t-shirt, blue jeans.
Looks like one of yours.

779
01:25:50,577 --> 01:25:53,681
I'm going to need you and another
witness to identify the body.

780
01:32:13,521 --> 01:32:17,393
Brad, did you know Gabriel
Nunez died trying to escape?

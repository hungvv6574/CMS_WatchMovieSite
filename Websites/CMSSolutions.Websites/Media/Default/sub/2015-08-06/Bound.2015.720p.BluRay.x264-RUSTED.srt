1
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:15,533
- God, I'm going to come!
- Yes, please!

2
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,543
Yes! Yes!

3
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,644
Yes!

4
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:30,689
Oh, God. That was amazing.

5
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,089
What?

6
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:44,060
There's an emergency at the office.
I have to go.

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,115
You have to go?

8
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:48,795
Yes. It's an emergency.
They need me right now.

9
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,968
I'm so sorry. It's terrible, I know.

10
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:55,438
Well, hey, I mean... Can I just,
you know, wait here for you?

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,675
I don't think that's a very good idea.

12
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:02,411
My daughter, Dara is coming home
any minute so you should probably...

13
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:05,682
- Hey... this was great.
- Yeah.

14
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:08,251
- I'll call you later.
- Sure.

15
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:18,537
Elliot has acquired the top three percent
of high-end properties

16
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:21,471
in L.A. in under five years.

17
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:25,558
An achievement I would say
is quite remarkable.

18
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:28,662
What they're offering us is salvation.

19
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:31,797
An opportunity for us to all win.

20
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:36,412
Either we take the deal
or we die a slow, painful death.

21
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:43,273
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- You have a better idea?

22
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:48,545
I... I...

23
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:52,219
It's a age old adage:
if you can't beat them, join them.

24
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,742
If you have something to say, say it.
We're not mind readers.

25
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:08,543
The ship's going down.
I would like to retire respectfully.

26
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:12,202
I'll make that decision, Preston.

27
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:13,836
Yes, of course.

28
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:17,040
But I have to admit,
I'm inclined to agree.

29
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,411
In the interim, I would like to know
exactly how many cents on the dollar.

30
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,849
Crunch these numbers for me, Preston.
Get back to me right away.

31
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:26,693
Absolutely. Gentlemen.

32
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:36,658
You said you wanted to sit at the table
with the big kids. Well, now you're here.

33
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,894
I know Dad, but I think
we can save this.

34
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:41,713
Just remember something, honey.

35
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:44,607
Pride comes before a fall.

36
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,307
I believe in you.

37
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,333
Hey, how was volleyball?

38
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:39,036
Sucked. Coach Lombard is an asshole.

39
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:41,472
I really don't like it when you swear.

40
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,326
She acts like Monica is God's gift

41
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,708
when Monica can't block
to save her fucking life.

42
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:46,890
No.

43
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,680
Mom, don't be so lame, okay? Come on.

44
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,983
Are you kidding me? You're not an adult.
You can't drink. This is not good for you.

45
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,852
- Oh, Plea... you drink.
- I'm an adult.

46
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:57,408
Well, I'm an adult.

47
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:01,099
Practically.

48
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:07,531
Fine, I'll just get some old perv
to get it for me like normal.

49
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:10,510
You know, that's not funny.

50
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:16,172
Mom, what did you make me for dinner?

51
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:24,232
Right over here.

52
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:35,925
Thank you.

53
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:40,880
So, can you at least pick a school
that you're not going to party at everyday?

54
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,766
Mom, I'm not going to party everyday.

55
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:49,784
I'll be playing volleyball six days a week.
I'll be too tired to party.

56
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:59,650
A whole week without me,
looking at schools...

57
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:03,350
I wanted to be a part of that.

58
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,519
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:09,788
Jessica's parents will be there
the whole time.

60
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:13,959
I just... I don't want to rush this.

61
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,320
You know,

62
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,796
my dad told me where to go
and that's where I went.

63
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:23,668
Well, I'm not you, Mom.

64
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:40,448
I'll affect everything.

65
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:43,365
Everything, Mom.

66
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:47,894
Yeah, of course.

67
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,880
Yeah.

68
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,068
- You know what? I have my card now.
- Okay.

69
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:08,357
You know what? Let's just go.

70
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,187
No. Now. Stop that!

71
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:15,951
- Mom, it's not a big deal.
- Yes, it is.

72
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,891
- I can't believe I did that.
- God, yeah. Way to dine and dash, Mom.

73
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:29,366
Hurry, please. I've got to go back there
and get my card.

74
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,868
- Hang on for just a second, okay?
- Dara!

75
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:34,461
- What?
- Go. Homework. Bed.

76
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:36,438
Fine.

77
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:41,133
Bye, Mom.

78
00:07:58,126 --> 00:08:02,231
- Oh, hi!
- Oh, hey. I got it right here.

79
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:05,668
Great, thank you.
I am so sorry that I forgot to sign.

80
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:07,179
It happens.

81
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,526
I figured you weren't some kind
of degenerate.

82
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:13,240
- Great.
- Thanks, sorry again.

83
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,887
Hey. Don't go.

84
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:20,080
- Sorry?
- Don't go.

85
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:23,819
Excuse me?

86
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,855
I want to talk to you.

87
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:29,340
What would you want to talk about?

88
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,549
Nothing too crazy. Yet.

89
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:37,014
I don't even know what that means.

90
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,067
Have a drink with me.

91
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:44,871
You know what? I can't.
I just forgot my card. I've got to go.

92
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,923
You are so beautiful.

93
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,137
Ryan.

94
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:55,398
Michelle. Nice to meet you,
but I really got to go.

95
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:56,967
Have a cigarette with me.

96
00:08:57,693 --> 00:09:00,092
- I don't smoke.
- Yeah, you do.

97
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:09,111
So, what do you do?

98
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:11,680
Does it matter?

99
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,171
Well, it does make
for polite conversation.

100
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:19,954
I do various things.

101
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:22,257
What do you do?

102
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:25,248
That's an intriguing answer.

103
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:29,360
I work in an office.

104
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,471
I can tell.

105
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:44,344
- I wouldn't know what to do.
- Just suck and blow.

106
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,394
You okay?

107
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:04,163
That's awful. Excuse me.

108
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:22,449
You know, I don't...
make it a habit to...

109
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,701
hook up with strangers.

110
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:34,750
- You are old.
- True statement.

111
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:41,556
Everyone's watching.

112
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:45,700
Sorry. It's just... I can't. I can't...

113
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,751
- What?
- I can't do this here.

114
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,242
Okay, then we won't.

115
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:04,690
It's just that I...

116
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:08,893
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
It was nice meeting you.

117
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:11,232
Michelle, hey.

118
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,143
You didn't waste my time.

119
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:17,378
I got the honor of meeting you.

120
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,789
Call me.

121
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,910
This morning, first ministers
meet for dinner,

122
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,913
but disagree on exactly
what the prime minister put on the menu.

123
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:06,590
And gearing up for another round

124
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,985
in the battle over one of Canada's
oldest forests.

125
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:11,652
Now the details. Bernie?

126
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:13,788
Good Morning!

127
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,813
Elliot's ROI in our wheel house
is going to suffer tremendously.

128
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:15,291
In the short few years they've been involved
in residential and commercial properties

129
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,584
they have suffered
a combined loss of nineteen percent.

130
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:21,753
That's a sixty four million dollar
write down.

131
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:26,940
The market will rise and when it does
that will be way more than 64 in the black.

132
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,428
Over half of those properties are in Beverly
Hills and Brentwood, for Christ's sakes.

133
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:32,001
Their properties aren't rising.

134
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:35,361
With the exception of those on the Westside,
which are virtually bullet proof.

135
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:38,169
And you discount everything
in West Hollywood?

136
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:40,871
It's really going to hell
down there, isn't it?

137
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:43,973
The only reason they are seeing returns

138
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,910
is because their cash flow
is unaffected.

139
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,316
Their current means of operation
is not sustainable.

140
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,750
- It's going to hurt them.
- You're sure about that?

141
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,309
I'm positive. Mulan properties is the
cornerstone of the Los Angeles Market.

142
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:00,325
We've been here for forty years.

143
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,353
I'm sure that I can provide a proposal

144
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:10,374
that will show them that Mulan properties
is the valuable asset they deserve.

145
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:14,160
Well, if you can do that,
we'll reevaluate.

146
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,934
Until then I...

147
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:19,575
I can't see any reason why they'd even
remotely want to keep us around.

148
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,873
I second that.

149
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,634
Thank you for your time, gentlemen.

150
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,915
You do realize
that this company has lost

151
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:48,871
over 100 million dollars
in the last two years.

152
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:54,642
We're going to make
the money back and then some.

153
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:56,212
I promise.

154
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,995
The entire board votes to sell.

155
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:04,123
You're the only one
that opposes, Michelle.

156
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:08,122
Dad, Elliot's real estate investment
strategies, they're flawed, okay?

157
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:11,525
If we merge we can help them.
We can save our company.

158
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,545
We don't have to close our doors.

159
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,346
Michelle, I love you,

160
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,854
but if you're going to throw
a last second Hail Mary

161
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:27,246
you better make sure Elliot
doesn't pull this deal off the table.

162
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:13,819
- Hi.
- Hi.

163
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,872
I'm... I'm so sorry
to drop by unannounced, but...

164
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:19,724
you're a difficult person
to get a hold of these days.

165
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:23,361
Yeah... works be kind of crazy.

166
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:26,095
Yeah, I know,
so your assistant tells me.

167
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:30,461
Well, I figured, you know,
because you've been working so hard

168
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:34,837
you're probably too tired to cook
so I brought dinner.

169
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,132
A little Chinese. I got your favorite.

170
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:42,794
Steamed chicken with veggies and a whole
handful of duck sauce packets.

171
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:46,992
Come on.

172
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,924
How's Dara? Did she pick a school yet?

173
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:58,297
She's looking.

174
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:02,666
You know, I saw this when I was
at the store the other day.

175
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,834
I thought it might help.

176
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:10,205
Oh, wow, that's really thoughtful.

177
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,541
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

178
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:15,444
She's a wonderful kid. I mean, I'm sure
she's going to make the right choice.

179
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:18,113
I hope so.

180
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:22,704
You know, I've been thinking about us.

181
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:24,347
About the future.

182
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:32,339
I got you something.

183
00:17:35,296 --> 00:17:36,687
Go on, open it.

184
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:44,407
Do you like them?

185
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:50,983
Hey, what's wrong?

186
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:57,652
I'm so sorry but I cannot except those.

187
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:00,323
It wouldn't be right.

188
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:04,824
Did you meet someone else?

189
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:08,494
No, no, it's not that. It's...

190
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:13,639
My company is going under.
I have a presentation to make.

191
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:16,833
My daughter is going away to college.
I have a million things on my mind.

192
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:20,677
Look, I know you've been stressed out
because of work and everything else.

193
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:23,109
It's... I... I understand that.

194
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:25,912
I thought it would be something
we could work through.

195
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:29,282
I mean, I'm patient.
I want to be there for you.

196
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:35,288
George, I don't feel
that way towards you.

197
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:40,384
I don't have that spark, you know?

198
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:43,773
Like that thing
that you're supposed to feel.

199
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:48,744
That... that it thing.
I don't... I don't feel it.

200
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:53,604
That sucks.

201
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:59,010
I'm sorry.

202
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:11,422
Look, I... I think
you just need some time.

203
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:14,943
At least that's what I hope it is.

204
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:18,071
I'm going to go.

205
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:29,106
So I got your Hollywood and Pacific
Palisades reports and... your coffee.

206
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,374
- Great, thank you.
- Yeah.

207
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,478
Thank you.

208
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:38,467
- Hey, any returns?
- No, sorry. I left two voicemails.

209
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:41,918
Oh, okay. Well, keep calling back
every half hour.

210
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:44,420
Will do.

211
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,558
Alright, thanks.

212
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:22,640
I have Jessie Aaron on the line,
senior portfolio manager from Elliot.

213
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,750
Send it through.

214
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,963
Mister Aaron, hi! Thanks for the return.

215
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:33,369
I was going over our acquisition
and I think with your cash flow

216
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:36,177
and our expertise we can make
both of our margins grow

217
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,774
and I was wondering if you'd
be willing to meet face to face?

218
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:42,776
Have lunch? Talk it out?

219
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:45,246
The Four Seasons, yes.

220
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:48,727
Two o'clock?

221
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:53,880
Yes. Two at the Four.
Thank you. See you soon.

222
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:57,124
We got a meeting!

223
00:20:57,224 --> 00:21:00,026
If we sell,
can I still be your assistant?

224
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,015
Well, if we sell we're both
going to be out of a job.

225
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,066
This is good.

226
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,140
Hello?

227
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:16,642
Have you changed your mind?

228
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,881
Yeah, hi, Ryan.

229
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,416
Bad time?

230
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,351
No.

231
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,631
I'm having lunch at a buddy's pad.
Why don't you join me?

232
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:48,473
- Michelle?
- Hi.

233
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,808
- How are you?
- Darrell, how are you?

234
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:56,380
I'm good. I just wanted to say
how much I love my new condo.

235
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,963
It's made a world of difference.

236
00:21:59,063 --> 00:22:01,676
It's changed my life.
Like night and day.

237
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:04,422
- It's no problem. Anything for a friend.
- Thank you so much.

238
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:06,991
- Yeah, it's good to see you. You look great!
- You too. You too.

239
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,395
Good to see you!

240
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:14,030
- Hi.
- Hi.

241
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,333
- See you, later.
- See you, man.

242
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:19,553
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

243
00:22:19,653 --> 00:22:23,011
- Good.
- It's good to see you again.

244
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:27,994
So I can only stay for a little bit, okay?
I have a meeting at two o'clock.

245
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:31,096
And it's like half an hour drive away.

246
00:22:31,196 --> 00:22:33,216
Relax.

247
00:22:37,653 --> 00:22:39,780
Relaxing is not my strong suite.

248
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,458
- I know.
- You know?

249
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:44,626
- What's up, Ryan?
- What's up, Darrell? What's up, buddy?

250
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:46,627
How do you two know each other?

251
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:51,432
Well, we're new friends.

252
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:55,013
Small world.
We got to hang out again, bro.

253
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:59,444
That night has to be
relived and relived.

254
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:02,101
Yeah...

255
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:04,633
Okay, well...

256
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:08,520
I'll leave you two alone.
I can take a hint.

257
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:10,989
- Good to see you!
- You too.

258
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,052
I honestly don't know what night
he's talking about.

259
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:17,791
I don't drink in the afternoon.

260
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:21,633
Yeah, you do.

261
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:27,711
Okay.

262
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:29,444
To new friends.

263
00:23:29,544 --> 00:23:31,837
To new friends.

264
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:38,978
I've been wanting to talk to you.

265
00:23:39,078 --> 00:23:41,615
What did you want to talk about?

266
00:23:42,415 --> 00:23:44,033
Your fantasies.

267
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,787
What are they?

268
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:51,051
That's a very unusual question
to ask somebody you barely know.

269
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:55,579
What makes you wet?

270
00:23:57,346 --> 00:24:01,733
I don't think anybody
has ever asked me that before.

271
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,212
I just did.

272
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:09,965
- I have to get this.
- Alright.

273
00:24:17,648 --> 00:24:22,119
Two Johnny Walker blue shots.

274
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:24,890
Thank you.

275
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,223
I can't take that.

276
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,800
- He's watching.
- No.

277
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:34,598
I have to take this. It's my assistant.

278
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:36,419
Alright.

279
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:39,266
Hello?

280
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:46,886
Right.

281
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:50,137
We could change that.

282
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:53,958
Can you call and maybe...

283
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:57,061
push to tomorrow or...

284
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,821
Something like that?

285
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:04,703
I don't know. Just tell them there's
an emergency or something. I don't know.

286
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,866
- Just tell them there's an emergency.
- I'm your emergency.

287
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:12,968
Thank you, Lee.

288
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:15,546
That was really stupid.

289
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:17,713
That was really stupid.

290
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:19,977
I should call him back.

291
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:22,153
Let's get out of here.

292
00:25:30,952 --> 00:25:33,142
This is it.

293
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:35,888
This is my office.

294
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:56,942
Sit.

295
00:26:12,692 --> 00:26:15,496
You're so beautiful.

296
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,763
Come here.

297
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:34,755
Are you down?

298
00:26:36,182 --> 00:26:38,019
Yes.

299
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:43,229
Where does your father sit?

300
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:47,769
Take me to your father's office.

301
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:49,893
Right now.

302
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:52,939
Okay.

303
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:02,211
This is it.

304
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:06,255
This is Daddy's office.

305
00:27:07,746 --> 00:27:10,735
Please don't touch anything, though.

306
00:27:11,117 --> 00:27:12,880
Sit.

307
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,160
You're a little daddy's girl.

308
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:43,405
Working for your dad.

309
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:48,581
Seeing him all day. Taking his orders.

310
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,461
You just love your daddy.

311
00:27:57,861 --> 00:28:00,932
He gives you everything you want.

312
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,904
You spoiled little brat.

313
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,476
I bet your clit's hard
sitting in your father's chair.

314
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:15,451
Touch it.

315
00:28:37,864 --> 00:28:40,980
Tell me about the first time
you touched yourself.

316
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:45,073
Okay.

317
00:28:49,243 --> 00:28:51,079
I was at...

318
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,491
a slumber party with my friends.

319
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,428
I was little.

320
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,745
We were watching a movie.

321
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:06,386
It was a romantic movie,
but there was...

322
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,379
a lot of kissing.

323
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:11,898
And that made you wet?

324
00:29:11,998 --> 00:29:14,071
Yeah.

325
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:20,941
And then what happened?

326
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:25,327
And then...

327
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,316
All the little girls went to sleep.

328
00:29:32,116 --> 00:29:33,985
And I was laying awake.

329
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:42,744
Then I grabbed my pillow
and put it between my legs.

330
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:47,717
You used a pillow? Not your fingers?

331
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:51,754
I thought my fingers were too dirty.

332
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:20,471
Oh, my God.

333
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:23,843
Oh, my God.

334
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:38,891
Put these on.

335
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,133
Why?

336
00:31:43,877 --> 00:31:44,911
Whose are they?

337
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:47,743
They belong to some dirty little slut.

338
00:31:47,843 --> 00:31:52,002
And that's what you are. So put them on.

339
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:04,230
Stop questioning me.

340
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,562
You'll need more training tomorrow.

341
00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:09,827
I can't.

342
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,906
I can't. My dad has a... fundraiser

343
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:19,011
and I have to give a business partner
a mea culpa for the meeting I missed.

344
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:23,281
When we going? What time?

345
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:25,584
You can't.

346
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:27,774
You can't go.

347
00:32:28,386 --> 00:32:30,621
- Why are you so scared, Michelle?
- I'm not scared.

348
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:33,526
He's not your daddy anymore.

349
00:32:34,326 --> 00:32:36,398
I'm your father.

350
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:40,207
I'm your master,

351
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:45,092
your husband and your god.

352
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:47,265
I'm your daddy.

353
00:32:52,376 --> 00:32:54,608
Be afraid of me.

354
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:58,158
Be afraid of what I'll do
if you don't obey me.

355
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:01,152
Let me take you somewhere.

356
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:09,529
- Where are we?
- You'll see.

357
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:15,497
She's with you?

358
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:26,074
Pay attention. That way you'll learn.

359
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:33,081
- And they want this?
- Pain is pleasure.

360
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,299
Are you okay?

361
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,435
I'm okay. That was... that was
really intense.

362
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,771
Yeah, that's what makes it fun.

363
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:07,006
You're crazy.

364
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:10,752
Crazy.

365
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:12,886
My god.

366
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:18,724
What turned you on in there?

367
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,063
The girl with the whip.

368
00:34:24,198 --> 00:34:26,031
And the way she was treating...

369
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,867
- Her sub?
- Her sub.

370
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:33,176
It made my whole body clench.

371
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:41,180
Whoa. Wait. He can see. He can see.

372
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,297
Let him watch.

373
00:34:44,717 --> 00:34:47,918
Red. Red.

374
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:53,758
Okay, fine.

375
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:58,064
Let's go some place else.
Let's go to your house.

376
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:01,767
No, my house is off limits.
My daughter's there.

377
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,235
Let's go to my place.

378
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:55,949
You're submissive and I'm dominant.

379
00:35:57,786 --> 00:36:00,355
You'll do what I say.

380
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:05,771
Okay.

381
00:36:37,258 --> 00:36:38,785
Strip!

382
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:50,327
I now own you.

383
00:37:54,198 --> 00:37:57,469
And when I'm finally finished
with you I'll fuck you.

384
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,295
Do you understand?

385
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:05,577
- Say, 'Yes Master'.
- Yes, Master.

386
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:28,693
Oh, my god.

387
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:50,217
Oh, my god.

388
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:24,445
Ryan?

389
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:29,546
- Ryan?
- Relax.

390
00:40:30,324 --> 00:40:33,423
- What are you doing?
- Don't hurt yourself.

391
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:55,603
Did you like it?

392
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:58,390
I liked it.

393
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:16,026
That was so intense.

394
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:25,469
So crazy.

395
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:28,909
You know, I don't know
anything about you.

396
00:41:30,605 --> 00:41:32,675
What do you need to know?

397
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:35,437
Your history.

398
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:38,421
Where you're from.

399
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:42,885
Why?

400
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:47,661
Because that's what normal people
talk about.

401
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:54,975
You don't want to tell me?

402
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:13,884
Can you help me?

403
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:22,722
- What did I tell you?
- What? I'm sorry.

404
00:42:22,822 --> 00:42:27,628
Oh, my god, I bet I have like ten
missed voicemails and nasty emails.

405
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:30,130
Oh, my god. It's my dad.

406
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,181
Fuck.

407
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:40,111
Hello?

408
00:42:42,207 --> 00:42:44,273
Yeah.

409
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:49,300
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yes, I was on my way to the meeting.

410
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,687
My phone died and then I got lost.
I was stranded.

411
00:42:54,387 --> 00:42:58,556
But I met this Good Samaritan
who let me charge my phone

412
00:42:58,656 --> 00:43:01,126
and I just now got all of the messages.

413
00:43:02,626 --> 00:43:06,790
Well, I'm sorry.
Can you just apologize for me?

414
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,511
Tell them I'm sorry
and there's nothing I can do.

415
00:43:09,611 --> 00:43:11,437
My phone died.

416
00:43:11,737 --> 00:43:13,204
And my hands were tied.

417
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:17,935
Tomorrow.

418
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:23,897
Yes, I will be there.
One thousand percent.

419
00:43:24,097 --> 00:43:25,969
With three chargers.

420
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,551
Yes, I'll be there.

421
00:43:31,722 --> 00:43:35,434
I will personally apologize
face to face to Jesse tomorrow.

422
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:40,265
He hung up on me.

423
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:47,036
He was really pissed off that I blew off
that investors meeting today...

424
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:49,474
to hang out with you.

425
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:55,216
There's just so much pressure.

426
00:43:56,277 --> 00:43:58,445
All the time.

427
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:01,385
Don't worry.

428
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,727
Just take it way.

429
00:44:10,326 --> 00:44:12,878
I like you, Michelle.

430
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,798
You're not like a lot of these
stupid little girls I meet.

431
00:44:16,898 --> 00:44:18,903
I like you too.

432
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:23,627
You're...

433
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:27,881
different, to say the least.

434
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:47,562
George? What are you doing here?

435
00:44:47,662 --> 00:44:49,764
I've been trying to get ahold of you.
Where have you been?

436
00:44:49,864 --> 00:44:53,834
George, you know it's not okay
to just come over unannounced.

437
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:58,072
What happened to you? I mean,
I thought we had something here.

438
00:44:58,472 --> 00:45:01,708
- What?
- I'm seeing someone.

439
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:04,610
- What? Who?
- That's not an appropriate question.

440
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,900
- I mean...
- George, I need you to leave.

441
00:45:08,114 --> 00:45:09,695
But... Michelle...

442
00:45:09,795 --> 00:45:12,328
- I can't believe this is happening!
- George. George...

443
00:45:12,428 --> 00:45:14,684
- You need to go. I'm sorry.
- No, but... but... Tell me what...

444
00:45:14,784 --> 00:45:16,843
I'm sorry.

445
00:45:47,419 --> 00:45:49,509
Is that your daughter?

446
00:45:51,523 --> 00:45:55,391
Just turn off your phone for a bit.
Turn off your phone.

447
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:04,446
I have something for you.

448
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:09,072
- You got me a present?
- More like a toy.

449
00:46:15,277 --> 00:46:17,868
Put it in your underwear.

450
00:46:22,175 --> 00:46:24,027
Do it.

451
00:46:33,897 --> 00:46:37,398
When my father was in the late stages
of the disease it was...

452
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:39,870
one of the scariest,
most hideous times of my life.

453
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,239
Numerous friends were affected.

454
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,968
Some of them passed.

455
00:46:47,568 --> 00:46:50,096
Some of them are still here with us.

456
00:46:50,196 --> 00:46:52,918
And some of them are
in this very room as I speak.

457
00:46:56,218 --> 00:47:00,522
Every one of us will know someone
connected to this disease.

458
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:03,288
Relax.

459
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:05,723
That's why I ask you, my friends...

460
00:47:12,934 --> 00:47:15,026
dig deep into your pockets.

461
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:18,498
Please continue to help St. Francis

462
00:47:18,598 --> 00:47:22,591
in their battle to try to find a cure
for this grueling disease.

463
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,434
Thank you.

464
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:35,562
Come on.

465
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:54,174
Hey.

466
00:48:02,548 --> 00:48:04,925
What are you doing to me?

467
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:12,532
What is it?

468
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,405
Put it on.

469
00:48:36,882 --> 00:48:38,977
Look at yourself.

470
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,255
What do you see?

471
00:48:43,555 --> 00:48:45,189
What do you see?

472
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:48,743
A messy whore.

473
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,184
What do you see?

474
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:07,945
- Now get out there.
- Wait... I can't.

475
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,646
You're being rude to your guests.

476
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,748
I can't go out there like this. Hold on.

477
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:14,617
Leave it. Don't wipe it off.

478
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:17,294
Go.

479
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,412
Speak of the devil.

480
00:49:29,998 --> 00:49:32,402
- Hi.
- Were you two in the bathroom together?

481
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:36,045
No. No, I was just fixing my makeup.

482
00:49:36,145 --> 00:49:39,292
Michelle, this is Jesse
from Elliot and Associates.

483
00:49:40,192 --> 00:49:44,796
- You're Michelle Milan?
- Jesse, it is so nice to meet you.

484
00:49:45,196 --> 00:49:47,233
I'm really sorry about the other day.

485
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:50,368
It's fine. I like missing
my workouts to get blown off.

486
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:52,773
I truly apologize.

487
00:49:53,372 --> 00:49:56,641
- And you are?
- None of your fucking business.

488
00:49:56,741 --> 00:49:59,043
And you're here because?

489
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:01,988
Because it's a free fucking country.

490
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,552
I would really like the opportunity
perhaps to sit down

491
00:50:08,652 --> 00:50:10,690
and maybe restructure...

492
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,026
the terms of your agreement.

493
00:50:15,126 --> 00:50:19,529
- Now is not the time to discuss business.
- It's too late. What do you mean?

494
00:50:24,036 --> 00:50:28,637
What I mean is I think that a merger might
be more beneficial than an acquisition.

495
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:31,262
Give me one good reason
why you think that Elliot

496
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,470
would benefit from merging with Mulan.

497
00:50:34,711 --> 00:50:39,883
Mulan has a reputation
and a loyal clientele base.

498
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:43,085
These are very valuable assets.

499
00:50:43,185 --> 00:50:46,856
Mulan Properties has lost over a hundred
million dollars in the last two years.

500
00:50:46,956 --> 00:50:48,791
Your company is falling apart.

501
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:50,959
If you don't take deal
your company, your clients,

502
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:54,931
and your reputation
will clearly crumble.

503
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:57,832
Well, I could prove to you
with hard numbers

504
00:50:58,032 --> 00:51:00,138
that a merger would make you more money.

505
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:10,146
- I'm okay.
- Michelle, are you drunk? What the hell?

506
00:51:10,246 --> 00:51:12,581
I'm going to give you one more chance
because of your father.

507
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:15,822
He was good friends
with my father and...

508
00:51:15,922 --> 00:51:21,335
and he is the only reason why I would
even agree to think about his pitch.

509
00:51:21,435 --> 00:51:26,460
Besides, this son of a bitch right here
went to Wharton which is where I went,

510
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,755
and he's been after me for years.

511
00:51:29,055 --> 00:51:30,971
Well...

512
00:51:31,371 --> 00:51:33,643
I'm sure that when you hear from me,
which will be very soon,

513
00:51:33,743 --> 00:51:36,704
I will have an offer
that you cannot refuse.

514
00:51:37,004 --> 00:51:40,006
You... you have a little
something there.

515
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:44,415
I look forward to speaking
to you soon, Jesse.

516
00:51:44,515 --> 00:51:46,332
Sure.

517
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:51,151
What is your problem?

518
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:53,920
Don't talk to me like that.

519
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,558
You could cost me my job.

520
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:01,663
Admit it. You liked it.

521
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:19,044
Oh, wow, Mom! You look hot!

522
00:52:20,078 --> 00:52:21,113
So?

523
00:52:21,613 --> 00:52:24,218
I want to go to Pepperdine.

524
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:27,341
That's nice.

525
00:52:28,686 --> 00:52:30,488
- Are you drunk?
- No.

526
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,636
- You are drunk!
- No, I'm not.

527
00:52:33,736 --> 00:52:36,962
I only had a couple of champagnes
at the benefit.

528
00:52:38,062 --> 00:52:43,235
Is that red lipstick? Oh, my god.
What happened to bore-me beige?

529
00:52:43,335 --> 00:52:47,125
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
You've been kissing.

530
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:50,976
- Yes, you have!
- No, no.

531
00:52:51,276 --> 00:52:55,539
Oh, god. Please tell me it wasn't
that douchebag, Preston, from the office.

532
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,014
No. God, no!

533
00:52:57,814 --> 00:52:59,782
- Not George?
- No, George is gone.

534
00:52:59,882 --> 00:53:02,153
Oh, thank god.

535
00:53:02,486 --> 00:53:06,022
Tell me it's not some online
dating loser or something.

536
00:53:06,622 --> 00:53:09,426
I believe you date people
that you meet online.

537
00:53:09,526 --> 00:53:12,042
Yeah, but Mom, from middle-aged people

538
00:53:12,142 --> 00:53:15,252
to be trolling the internet
for sex is weird.

539
00:53:15,352 --> 00:53:19,301
- Middle-aged people.
- Oh, Mom. Come on.

540
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:22,971
But people my age it's...
totally normal.

541
00:53:23,171 --> 00:53:26,778
- Are you sexually active?
- Are you?

542
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:36,619
He must be pretty good.
He left you speechless.

543
00:53:40,423 --> 00:53:43,591
This is Mistress Alana
with spanking 101.

544
00:53:43,691 --> 00:53:45,928
Simple spanking is, in my opinion,

545
00:53:46,028 --> 00:53:49,691
the most effective way to introduce
erotic pain to a submissive.

546
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,777
Start without any binding
at all to build trust.

547
00:53:52,877 --> 00:53:57,927
Then begin by lightly massaging
the buttocks.

548
00:53:59,374 --> 00:54:02,797
We actually have a safe word too.
If a good dominant knows anything,

549
00:54:02,897 --> 00:54:07,181
it's the importance of safety
and consent.

550
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:10,702
Okay, so... keep your hand cupped,
fingers together,

551
00:54:10,802 --> 00:54:14,288
and remember to aim for the lower,
fleshy part of the buttocks.

552
00:54:15,488 --> 00:54:17,625
Just like that.

553
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,537
And twelve more

554
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:25,433
just... like... that.

555
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:36,242
Okay, and then sign it Yours Truly,
yada yada yada...

556
00:54:36,342 --> 00:54:38,177
Yada yada yada... And done and done.

557
00:54:38,277 --> 00:54:40,646
Thank you, babe.

558
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:51,961
- Hi.
- Have a seat, please.

559
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:56,152
Preston brought me up to speed.

560
00:54:56,886 --> 00:55:00,196
I am also aware of the fact that you
blew off your meeting with Jesse.

561
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,680
Smooth, Michelle. Real smooth.

562
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,907
I'm sorry about my behavior lately, Dad.

563
00:55:08,675 --> 00:55:12,502
Ryan Black. Really, Chelle?

564
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:15,495
A drug dealing car thief
in front of our colleagues?

565
00:55:16,095 --> 00:55:18,481
What were you thinking?

566
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:23,488
I'm sorry.

567
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:32,280
I am so sick and tired of hearing those
words come out of your lips, Michelle.

568
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,432
I really am.

569
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:40,128
You had sex with someone in the bathroom

570
00:55:40,428 --> 00:55:42,505
at the Alzheimer's fund raiser.

571
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,930
Do you have any idea how embarrassing,

572
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,731
in front of people that I have
depended on to raise millions of dollars

573
00:55:48,831 --> 00:55:51,464
for St. Francis for many, many years.

574
00:55:51,964 --> 00:55:54,625
Your disgraceful
and reprehensible behavior

575
00:55:54,725 --> 00:55:58,120
is a reflection
on our family's good name.

576
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:03,675
I promise you I will never let my personal
life interfere with my work again.

577
00:56:03,775 --> 00:56:09,637
You have my word. I am 100%
dedicated to this company.

578
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:21,043
Your professional life should never
involve commoners, Michelle.

579
00:56:21,843 --> 00:56:24,280
Note to self.

580
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,342
Moving on...

581
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:32,021
this deal with Jesse, it's a big one.

582
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:35,223
Our entire family's legacy
depends on it.

583
00:56:35,323 --> 00:56:38,138
No, I know. Listen...

584
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:41,329
I've been doing a lot of analysis

585
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:45,222
and the way Elliot has been structuring
their real estate investment deals

586
00:56:46,022 --> 00:56:50,280
and the locations that they're picking,
and I think with our expertise...

587
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:53,940
You know, we don't have
the capital they have

588
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,612
so if we could just get them to purchase
where we can't purchase

589
00:56:57,712 --> 00:57:02,704
then I think our expertise and their capital,
we can make something work.

590
00:57:02,804 --> 00:57:04,773
You know, we don't have to...

591
00:57:04,873 --> 00:57:08,663
be acquired we can do a merger
and we can run their real estate division

592
00:57:08,763 --> 00:57:12,110
and make them tons of money and
I think they're really going to go for it.

593
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:14,535
I think they really will go for it.

594
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:17,924
I just... I just need a little bit more
time to work on the projections

595
00:57:18,024 --> 00:57:20,517
and it's there. It's there.

596
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:22,650
Michelle...

597
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:25,208
you're not ready.

598
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:28,785
I am inclined to sell.

599
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:32,929
Against my chief officer's
financial advice

600
00:57:33,029 --> 00:57:36,382
I am going to give you a window.

601
00:57:36,482 --> 00:57:39,853
A very short window, Michelle.

602
00:57:39,953 --> 00:57:43,407
And only because you're my daughter
and I love you.

603
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,862
Don't fuck it up.

604
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:50,194
Now go.

605
00:57:50,294 --> 00:57:52,332
Okay.

606
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:03,891
No... I'm calling to get
the sale price. Yeah.

607
00:58:03,991 --> 00:58:06,756
Well, I understand that the sale price
is not available to the public

608
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:08,846
but I'm not the public. I'm a realtor.

609
00:58:09,446 --> 00:58:10,875
Everything is for sale.

610
00:58:10,975 --> 00:58:15,885
Listen, maybe we got off on the wrong foot.
Okay, let's try this again.

611
00:58:15,985 --> 00:58:19,990
What if I have messengered over
a thousand-dollar check?

612
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,626
Do you think then you could
dig up the sale price for me?

613
00:58:26,764 --> 00:58:28,797
Unbelievable.

614
00:58:55,992 --> 00:58:58,000
I've got it.

615
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,351
I've got it.

616
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,335
Yes, hello this is Michelle Mulan
for Peter Sonders.

617
00:59:21,435 --> 00:59:25,224
I see. Well, I'm sure he could call me back
but I think he's going to want to hear

618
00:59:25,324 --> 00:59:28,923
what I have to say
about the Pacific Design Center.

619
00:59:29,923 --> 00:59:33,928
Yeah, I'd rather not leave a message
and have him call me back.

620
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:38,198
No, and I think he'd be really disappointed
if he found out that you left me holding,

621
00:59:38,298 --> 00:59:42,237
especially considering I can probably
make him about a billion dollars right now.

622
00:59:44,537 --> 00:59:48,126
Paul, hi.

623
00:59:48,959 --> 00:59:54,115
Yes, I have some
very intriguing news for you.

624
01:02:07,175 --> 01:02:09,911
Have you ever been a submissive?

625
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,351
Maybe.

626
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:18,947
Can I spank you?

627
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,356
No.

628
01:02:23,756 --> 01:02:28,097
No, you don't want to be spanked
or no, you don't want to be spanked by me?

629
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:34,006
Is that what happened in the restaurant
that day with Alana?

630
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:37,179
She's a psychopath.

631
01:02:37,279 --> 01:02:40,164
Whatever she tells you is lies.

632
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:47,281
Well, I've never met her.
She didn't tell me anything.

633
01:02:47,381 --> 01:02:50,349
I did see her in a video though.

634
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:54,235
You've been researching on your own.

635
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,491
Is that where this is coming from?

636
01:03:02,527 --> 01:03:04,800
This is my world.

637
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,572
You're not ready for it.

638
01:03:10,672 --> 01:03:13,047
Far from it.

639
01:03:14,304 --> 01:03:17,826
You should say thank you,
Master and that's all.

640
01:03:20,511 --> 01:03:23,400
Thank you, Master.

641
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:40,003
I still want to try it though.

642
01:03:45,903 --> 01:03:47,375
Leave.

643
01:03:50,975 --> 01:03:52,221
- Get out, now.
- What?

644
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:56,212
- Get the fuck out, now!
- Jesus.

645
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:13,862
That's a beauty. Genuine brocade.

646
01:04:14,162 --> 01:04:18,467
You would have subs lined up around
the block. Would you like to try it on?

647
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:22,571
Oh, are they actually for sale?
Or are they just samples?

648
01:04:22,671 --> 01:04:25,741
No, of course they're for sale.
You can't get stuff like this at the mall.

649
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:30,111
How do you know what size to get?

650
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,354
You're Ryan's friend?

651
01:04:54,035 --> 01:04:56,358
Do you want to pet my puppy?

652
01:04:57,303 --> 01:05:00,210
You're Ryan's sub.

653
01:05:00,941 --> 01:05:02,477
Yes, Mistress.

654
01:05:03,977 --> 01:05:07,314
You don't have to call me that.
Not unless you want to.

655
01:05:07,614 --> 01:05:10,001
What's your name?

656
01:05:10,585 --> 01:05:12,053
Michelle.

657
01:05:12,153 --> 01:05:13,855
Sit, puppy!

658
01:05:14,855 --> 01:05:17,291
Good girl.

659
01:05:19,191 --> 01:05:21,227
It's called puppy play.

660
01:05:21,327 --> 01:05:24,831
- And she likes this?
- Ask her.

661
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,004
You like this?

662
01:05:29,002 --> 01:05:31,763
Stay puppy.

663
01:05:34,641 --> 01:05:37,443
Can I give you some advice, Michelle?

664
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:40,045
Be careful with Ryan.

665
01:05:40,622 --> 01:05:42,817
He's dangerous.

666
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:46,486
He hurts people. Not just
their bodies but their lives.

667
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:49,562
He gets off on it.

668
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:51,720
Why should I believe you?

669
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:58,566
Don't. I just thought someone
should warn you to watch out.

670
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:02,301
Why do you care?

671
01:06:03,183 --> 01:06:08,406
Because people like Ryan
give people like us a bad name.

672
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:13,710
These are loving, creative,
smart people here.

673
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:16,295
And Ryan is a predator.

674
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:20,952
So what does that make me? The victim?

675
01:06:22,252 --> 01:06:24,715
You're feisty.

676
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:28,305
Looks to me like you've been
on the wrong side of the whip.

677
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:32,707
Stay where you are puppy.
Come, follow me.

678
01:06:45,307 --> 01:06:48,412
Would you like to help administer
some medicine to the patient?

679
01:06:48,812 --> 01:06:51,879
I think we'd all love
to see a scene with you.

680
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:56,352
I wouldn't know what to do.

681
01:06:56,452 --> 01:07:00,155
Oh, our patient is more than happy
to help train a student.

682
01:07:00,655 --> 01:07:03,024
Do you want to play?

683
01:07:27,759 --> 01:07:30,109
Good job.

684
01:08:22,735 --> 01:08:23,970
Oh, my god.

685
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,971
Oh, my god. I thought
you were working all night.

686
01:08:26,071 --> 01:08:28,475
Get away from my daughter!

687
01:08:29,475 --> 01:08:32,811
- Why would you go after her, Ryan?
- Wait, you know each other?

688
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,748
Your daughter is a really
naughty girl, Michelle.

689
01:08:36,848 --> 01:08:38,049
I'll fucking kill you!

690
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:39,550
- I can't get out of these!
- Okay.

691
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:42,470
- You can't even untie those knots.
- Get me out of these!

692
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:45,489
I will call the police.
They will throw the key away.

693
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:50,128
For what? For meeting a girl
and not having sex with her?

694
01:08:50,228 --> 01:08:51,629
Shut up!

695
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:55,385
Your daughter really looks like you.

696
01:08:55,485 --> 01:08:57,996
I would love to see you two kiss.

697
01:08:58,096 --> 01:08:59,036
I will kill you.

698
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:01,471
I am your master!

699
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:04,142
Don't fucking forget it!

700
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:07,577
- Fuck!
- Get away from me.

701
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:10,457
Mom, I can't get out!

702
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:14,584
You're weak! Both of you!
And you're always going to be weak!

703
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:16,914
Get out of here!

704
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:27,709
Please... Mom.

705
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:33,568
Come here. Here you go.

706
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:35,470
Baby.

707
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:39,843
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry.

708
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:41,485
It's okay.

709
01:09:41,585 --> 01:09:44,379
It's okay now. It's okay.

710
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,983
Mom, is that the guy?

711
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:50,519
Is that the guy from the other night
that you kissed?

712
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,155
Yeah. It is.

713
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,623
I didn't know.

714
01:09:55,723 --> 01:09:57,259
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

715
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,840
I know, honey. No, it's okay.

716
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,841
Baby, I'm sorry.

717
01:10:03,941 --> 01:10:07,970
I'm so sorry I brought that monster
into our life.

718
01:10:19,626 --> 01:10:22,287
Preston and the big man
are waiting for you.

719
01:10:22,387 --> 01:10:25,619
- Is it three o'clock already?
- It's 3:17.

720
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:27,254
Shit.

721
01:10:29,222 --> 01:10:32,093
I'm sorry, I was just...
finalizing some numbers.

722
01:10:32,193 --> 01:10:34,573
Sorry. Okay.

723
01:10:36,162 --> 01:10:38,123
- Alright, what do you got?
- As we know,

724
01:10:38,223 --> 01:10:42,369
Elliot and associates has been
primarily involved in technology.

725
01:10:42,469 --> 01:10:47,400
Where are the numbers? You said
you were going to make a valid argument.

726
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,875
Yes, it's just that the numbers
are going to take a little bit more time.

727
01:10:50,975 --> 01:10:55,685
They're a little bit more comprehensive
than I first anticipated. So I just...

728
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:57,472
With all due respect...

729
01:10:57,572 --> 01:11:02,004
I recommend we take their offer
before they pull it off the table.

730
01:11:02,104 --> 01:11:03,556
I'm inclined to do just that.

731
01:11:03,656 --> 01:11:06,658
- You know what? No, Dad, please just...
- Please what?

732
01:11:07,558 --> 01:11:11,367
There's a hundred and fifty million
dollar deal on the table here.

733
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:18,836
Preston, I want you to head up
this acquisition personally.

734
01:11:18,936 --> 01:11:23,594
The usual suspects involved.
Take no prisoners. Kill them all.

735
01:11:23,694 --> 01:11:27,479
You know, Dad, I can fucking
handle this. I've got it.

736
01:11:27,579 --> 01:11:30,149
I know what I'm doing.

737
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:34,818
Would you gentlemen
excuse me for a moment?

738
01:11:34,918 --> 01:11:37,165
Let's step outside for a moment.

739
01:11:50,867 --> 01:11:53,614
I fucking got it?

740
01:11:54,491 --> 01:11:56,862
Not for long.

741
01:11:58,707 --> 01:12:00,615
I think you should take
the rest of the day off.

742
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:05,508
Maybe the next few days.
You look like you could use it.

743
01:12:10,287 --> 01:12:11,451
Now please.

744
01:12:57,297 --> 01:12:59,601
I've been wanting to talk to you.

745
01:12:59,701 --> 01:13:01,869
What did you want to talk about?

746
01:13:01,969 --> 01:13:04,804
Your fantasies. I am your master!

747
01:13:04,904 --> 01:13:06,974
- Don't you fucking forget it!
- Mom! I can't get it off me!

748
01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:09,475
Your disgraceful
and reprehensible behavior.

749
01:13:09,575 --> 01:13:11,577
Be afraid of what I'll do
if you don't obey me.

750
01:13:11,677 --> 01:13:15,768
- A drug dealing car thief?
- He's dangerous.

751
01:13:23,991 --> 01:13:26,427
- Fuck!
- Shit!

752
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,998
You can take it but you can't dish it out!
You should leave the pain to the experts.

753
01:13:31,098 --> 01:13:33,099
Suck my dick, slave!

754
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,729
You stay the fuck away from my daughter

755
01:13:34,829 --> 01:13:38,068
or I swear to God you will regret
the day you were born.

756
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:42,259
Good. When I met you,
I knew you were weak.

757
01:13:42,359 --> 01:13:45,343
A pathetic divorcee
who needed some dick.

758
01:13:45,443 --> 01:13:47,298
I gave you what you wanted!

759
01:13:47,398 --> 01:13:51,350
I turned you from a mousy little
weakling to a sex goddess.

760
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,653
You should worship the ground I walk on.

761
01:13:53,753 --> 01:13:55,149
Fuck you!

762
01:14:01,226 --> 01:14:03,162
Go cry to your daddy.

763
01:14:03,662 --> 01:14:07,231
If I want to fuck
your hot daughter, I will.

764
01:14:35,425 --> 01:14:36,881
What is this?

765
01:14:36,981 --> 01:14:39,563
Good morning, sunshine.

766
01:14:40,663 --> 01:14:42,962
I've been thinking...

767
01:14:43,433 --> 01:14:47,005
I've been thinking
that I would call the police...

768
01:14:48,105 --> 01:14:50,239
and tell them about you meeting
with my underage daughter

769
01:14:50,339 --> 01:14:52,974
but then I thought you've wormed
your way out of jail before.

770
01:14:53,074 --> 01:14:54,949
There's no doubt you'd do it again.

771
01:14:59,515 --> 01:15:02,047
What I want...

772
01:15:03,552 --> 01:15:07,737
is to send a very clear message,

773
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:12,193
that I can and will kill you.

774
01:15:18,467 --> 01:15:20,591
Your nipples.

775
01:15:20,691 --> 01:15:23,530
They're offensively naked.

776
01:15:35,617 --> 01:15:39,859
You fucking amateur. It's too tight.

777
01:15:39,959 --> 01:15:43,858
It's not tight enough
if you can still talk.

778
01:15:48,662 --> 01:15:51,367
Not as bad as I thought you'd be.

779
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:56,865
The most offensive of all.

780
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:15,109
Let's unzip this. I want to hear
all of your screams.

781
01:16:16,056 --> 01:16:20,259
Eeny, meany, miney, moe.

782
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:23,425
If you put that down right now,
I'll forgive you.

783
01:16:28,434 --> 01:16:33,939
I don't want your forgiveness.
I don't need your forgiveness.

784
01:16:48,787 --> 01:16:49,720
More?

785
01:16:55,493 --> 01:16:56,859
What?

786
01:17:16,546 --> 01:17:18,753
Still with me?

787
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:28,565
Darn.

788
01:17:35,237 --> 01:17:36,181
Fuck!

789
01:17:38,706 --> 01:17:41,238
Fucking broke my ankle.

790
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,265
Ryan?

791
01:17:59,154 --> 01:18:01,122
What did you learn?

792
01:18:01,222 --> 01:18:03,960
Stay away from you and your daughter.

793
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,656
Good boy.

794
01:18:07,356 --> 01:18:09,413
Good boy.

795
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:18,405
Oh, don't fucking leave me.
Don't... my foot. My...

796
01:18:18,505 --> 01:18:20,375
Well, don't worry.
Someone will be here soon.

797
01:18:20,475 --> 01:18:23,599
Oh, I did call somebody after all.

798
01:18:24,244 --> 01:18:26,632
Good luck explaining all those...

799
01:18:26,732 --> 01:18:31,440
unsolicited messages to my underage
daughter on your hard drive.

800
01:18:32,085 --> 01:18:34,586
Twisted little fuck.

801
01:19:05,918 --> 01:19:07,954
Yes?

802
01:19:08,954 --> 01:19:11,361
I'll be right there. Thank you.

803
01:19:21,266 --> 01:19:22,815
Hello.

804
01:19:22,915 --> 01:19:24,035
Hello.

805
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:26,138
I'm here to see Jesse Aaron.

806
01:19:26,338 --> 01:19:27,905
Do you have an appointment?

807
01:19:28,005 --> 01:19:32,048
Can you let him know that Michelle Mulan
is here and I should see him immediately.

808
01:19:37,448 --> 01:19:40,719
Okay. Someone did some work!

809
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,876
Yeah, I did.

810
01:19:42,976 --> 01:19:46,824
So listen, when Preston and my dad come
have them meet me here immediately.

811
01:19:46,924 --> 01:19:49,393
- You got it.
- Thank you.

812
01:19:50,593 --> 01:19:51,639
Michelle Mulan?

813
01:19:53,385 --> 01:19:55,431
- Nice to meet you.
- He's ready to see you.

814
01:19:55,531 --> 01:19:57,336
Great.

815
01:19:58,936 --> 01:20:01,972
You've got a lot of balls, Michelle.
Have a seat.

816
01:20:02,272 --> 01:20:04,543
- Thank you for...
- Don't thank me yet.

817
01:20:06,443 --> 01:20:08,081
I...

818
01:20:08,584 --> 01:20:11,314
I have a proposal for you.

819
01:20:11,414 --> 01:20:13,064
I've been doing research.

820
01:20:13,164 --> 01:20:16,236
I've discovered the properties
they are looking into

821
01:20:16,336 --> 01:20:18,520
and the ones they have
recently acquired.

822
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:20,868
I think that I might have a solution

823
01:20:20,968 --> 01:20:25,412
that can both, benefit us
and all of our problems and them.

824
01:20:25,512 --> 01:20:27,291
Hear me out.

825
01:20:27,391 --> 01:20:32,267
925 Canon Drive.
136-1 Old Beverly Drive.

826
01:20:32,367 --> 01:20:36,906
These are all properties they are going
to close on. All in Beverly Hills.

827
01:20:38,706 --> 01:20:40,857
I'm listening.

828
01:20:50,951 --> 01:20:52,629
You can get us these properties?

829
01:20:53,754 --> 01:20:57,280
I've done the research and I've looked
at your current real estate profile

830
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:00,028
and this expands your target areas.

831
01:21:00,128 --> 01:21:02,949
We have exclusive access
not only to that building

832
01:21:03,049 --> 01:21:05,031
but to all of the properties
listed there.

833
01:21:05,131 --> 01:21:10,003
Now understanding their business
model we can provide them.

834
01:21:10,103 --> 01:21:15,409
Just us because of our reputation
and our connections...

835
01:21:15,509 --> 01:21:19,980
we can provide them
with 33 Redbook and 480 Doheny.

836
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,482
That's a hundred million dollar estate.

837
01:21:22,682 --> 01:21:27,621
Yes, it is, Preston. And a hundred
million dollars is nothing to them.

838
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:30,223
Don't interrupt me again.

839
01:21:31,134 --> 01:21:34,591
The numbers look promising, ambitious.

840
01:21:34,691 --> 01:21:38,224
- I've put a lot of time and energy into it.
- I like money and that's it.

841
01:21:38,324 --> 01:21:41,702
So what's to stop me from just buying
this all up myself if we wanted to?

842
01:21:42,002 --> 01:21:46,639
I don't believe you'd do that. I mean,
I have an NDA disclosure if you'd like it.

843
01:21:46,739 --> 01:21:48,441
I wouldn't sign it from you.

844
01:21:49,241 --> 01:21:50,946
But I won't steal your game plan

845
01:21:51,046 --> 01:21:53,698
or post your contacts either.
I'm not a dick like that.

846
01:21:53,798 --> 01:21:57,016
What do you know about
the Pacific Design Center?

847
01:21:57,416 --> 01:22:00,952
Three hundred and twenty five
million dollar building.

848
01:22:01,052 --> 01:22:03,055
- It's failing.
- How do you know that?

849
01:22:03,255 --> 01:22:07,592
Because I did the research myself.
I spoke to Paul Sonders.

850
01:22:07,692 --> 01:22:10,161
Got the information
directly from his mouth.

851
01:22:10,261 --> 01:22:13,275
I also obtained a selling price.

852
01:22:13,931 --> 01:22:18,703
You've put together quite the ambitious
proposal. I'm... I'm impressed.

853
01:22:18,903 --> 01:22:22,239
With your capital and our resources
we can run L.A.

854
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:25,842
I heard the pitch.
I heard what you said.

855
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:27,478
Look, I'll have my guys review this.

856
01:22:27,578 --> 01:22:31,783
And if we like it we will maybe restructure
our offer or merger rather.

857
01:22:31,883 --> 01:22:35,466
Okay, well, in the case
that you do like it

858
01:22:35,566 --> 01:22:38,572
I've gone ahead and drawn
a little something up.

859
01:22:38,672 --> 01:22:41,581
If they go for it we stand to make...

860
01:22:41,681 --> 01:22:45,625
four hundred million dollars
in the next six years.

861
01:22:45,725 --> 01:22:48,165
How are you going
to get Elliot to go for it?

862
01:22:48,465 --> 01:22:52,702
Well, that's simple. We'll sit down
and have a little face to face.

863
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:55,271
Jesse? He thinks you're a fuck up.

864
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:57,340
Not when I'm done with him.

865
01:22:58,072 --> 01:23:00,576
Jesse, do you mind
if I call you Jesse? Do you?

866
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:05,547
I've reviewed your real estate choices
and they're weak at best.

867
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:09,388
You know technology, agriculture...

868
01:23:09,488 --> 01:23:13,455
but you need Mulan Properties
to run your real estate division.

869
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:17,052
I can tell you what to buy
and what to sell

870
01:23:17,152 --> 01:23:20,215
and when to do it
if you want to make money.

871
01:23:20,315 --> 01:23:22,931
If you're into that kind of thing.

872
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:29,803
In all honesty, two to three
hundred million, not that much to me.

873
01:23:29,903 --> 01:23:33,432
But I am seriously going
to review this because...

874
01:23:34,007 --> 01:23:36,268
there's something about you.

875
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:39,982
I've underestimated you, Michelle Mulan.

876
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:43,052
You won't do that again.

877
01:23:45,032 --> 01:23:48,375
If my team approves you will have
a merger agreement by the end of tomorrow.

878
01:23:48,475 --> 01:23:51,927
If not, then I'm sorry.
That's all we can do for you.

879
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:55,994
Well, then I look forward to seeing you
at the end of business tomorrow.

880
01:24:12,612 --> 01:24:16,384
Can't believe it's come to this.
Waiting like dogs.

881
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:18,485
Have a little faith in me, Preston.

882
01:24:18,585 --> 01:24:22,121
- Good God.
- That's enough, Preston.

883
01:24:23,121 --> 01:24:26,790
Seven o'clock. Smells like a fail.

884
01:24:30,463 --> 01:24:33,031
Sorry we're late. Traffic.

885
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:36,304
Hi, Jesse. Thank you for coming.
Have a seat.

886
01:24:37,704 --> 01:24:42,742
So, I think you'll find the terms
of this merger most favorable.

887
01:24:43,042 --> 01:24:46,211
I'm sure but we'll have Dad have a look.

888
01:24:47,411 --> 01:24:52,383
As your father and I used to say,
let's get to the important pages.

889
01:24:52,683 --> 01:24:55,020
You know, you really
ought to thank Michelle for this.

890
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,656
She is one savvy lady.

891
01:24:57,756 --> 01:25:01,258
Preston, I'm surprised you didn't
come to me with this yourself.

892
01:25:01,358 --> 01:25:03,227
Yeah, I...

893
01:25:03,627 --> 01:25:06,193
Preston's a little short-sighted.

894
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:09,301
So, do we got a deal?

895
01:25:10,968 --> 01:25:13,254
We do indeed, Jess.

896
01:25:13,354 --> 01:25:17,040
I'll see you all next week. I'm going
to personally oversee this myself.

897
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:20,045
Look forward to it. Thank you.
Thank you, gentlemen.

898
01:25:22,345 --> 01:25:25,210
Well, Chells, I'm proud of you.

899
01:25:25,716 --> 01:25:27,896
And... if you take a look right here

900
01:25:27,996 --> 01:25:33,631
it says the signature is required
by any and all partners.

901
01:25:33,857 --> 01:25:35,847
Partner?

902
01:25:35,947 --> 01:25:40,263
Yes, honey. Yes, sweetie, you earned it.

903
01:25:41,063 --> 01:25:44,934
Preston, this company for the first
time now has a partnership.

904
01:25:45,034 --> 01:25:48,171
I think you should
congratulate Michelle.

905
01:25:49,471 --> 01:25:51,749
Congratulations, Michelle.

906
01:25:53,976 --> 01:25:56,880
I think you can call me boss.

907
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:02,076
You... did it.

908
01:26:02,176 --> 01:26:04,426
And you...

909
01:26:05,599 --> 01:26:07,660
deserve a treat.

910
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,591
- I'll take that one.
- Alright.

911
01:26:09,691 --> 01:26:12,393
I like this success thing.
Let's keep doing it.

912
01:26:12,493 --> 01:26:16,153
I had one more point I wanted to go over
with you, Michelle, if that is okay.

913
01:26:16,253 --> 01:26:19,801
Can we... discuss it?

914
01:26:19,901 --> 01:26:23,471
Yes. Yeah, thanks. Grab the door.

915
01:26:23,571 --> 01:26:25,912
Have a seat.

916
01:26:32,612 --> 01:26:35,857
I wanted to know if you wanted
to have dinner with me.

917
01:26:37,118 --> 01:26:39,525
That would be wonderful.

918
01:26:44,425 --> 01:26:47,381
Are you sure though that...

919
01:26:47,881 --> 01:26:50,964
you don't want something...

920
01:26:51,687 --> 01:26:53,888
maybe...

921
01:26:55,201 --> 01:26:57,476
a little more...

922
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:00,389
kinky?

923
01:27:01,107 --> 01:27:03,178
Yes, mistress.

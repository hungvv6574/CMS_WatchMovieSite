This ring, I can appreciate it.

18
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,415
It is worth nothing.

19
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:58,325
Junk, can you imagine that?

20
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:00,299
People put such a
shitty ring in the safe.

21
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,538
They make fun of us, really.

22
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,223
You ought to show, Albert.

23
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:05,988

Estimated cost:40 million euros for
a stone. Do you know what that means?

29
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:26,768
Scylla is very reliable.

30
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,553
I do not care.
That's not my problem.

31
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:30,675

You do not move.

34
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,699
That's the problem.
You do what they tell you.

35
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,334
You're a thief, yeah right.

36
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:44,938
Like everyone else, the bankers, the people who
us go up to the alarm clock on television.

37
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:48,692
Your problem is that you're not a political

Do you see that?

41
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:56,035
-- What?
-- The ancients there.

00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,621
As they are. This is my wish.

43
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,583
Damn. This is proof.

44
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:03,923
Absolutely no political conscience.
As this old guy to be.

45
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:07,567
Listen, love fairy, I'm just
out of jail and I feel lonely.

00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:44,722
Have I told you so. He is a
Genius, but he prefers to work alone.

50
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,076
He broods too much.

51
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:50,000
These are the plans of the security system,
that is installed by the company LINVAS.

52
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,280
Check it out.

53
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,964
The diamond is at the Grand Hotel
issued by Antwerp.

54
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,278
And we have the list of all
Those during the auction

55
00:05:58,297 --> 00:05:59,969

56
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:10,779
That probably means you're at it.

57
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,386
I trust Albert and Albert trusted you.

58
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:17,866
Who is responsible for the auction?

59
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:47,897
Well, until next month.

60
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:49,340
Simon.

61
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:52,705
Hello.

62
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:55,662
Sit down.

63
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:02,995
The workshop called me yesterday.

64
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,661
How did you do that again?

65
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,476
Shit happens. I'm just
slipped on the stairs.

66
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:13,042
I do not like that
you can not work.

67
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:16,722
Who does not work, hanging out, and who
hanging around, comes silly ideas.

68
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,170
What will you do with your free time?

69
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:21,974
Stop smoking.

70
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:24,413
I do not smoke.

71
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:26,442
You think I'm stupid?

72
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:28,493
Here smoking is prohibited, and
what you've got in your hand?

73
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:29,658
It is not.

74
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,086
To or not, I do not care.
You smoke.

75
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:32,777
Are you going with me to just
as with your cigarettes?

76
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:34,581
You act as if you

77
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,228
and secretly want
again turn a thing.

78
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,028
Am I your probation

79
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:39,387
I'll put them away.

80
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:41,224
I should perhaps you under
stricter security questions.

81
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:42,910
Here, I'll put them away. Hopp.

82
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,390
And stop smoking.

83
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,671
Good day.
Come on in.

84
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:01,732
I met Marie,
when she and her daughter Julia

85
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:05,852
on our family estate after
the diamond, the Florentin, was looking for.

86
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:08,013
She has been looking a long time.

87
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,732
12 years.

88
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:11,381
And they found him.

89
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:14,981
Marie was a very warm woman.

90
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:20,146
Your charisma, intelligence,
their persistence will be missed.

91
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:24,947
Marie and her daughter have us
shown that you should never give up

92
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,589
no matter what ever you are looking for.

93
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,960
That is what our
Existence is a real sense.

94
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:39,630
Pierre, my sincere condolences.

95
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,633

Monsieur Galley before with
Monsieur Malleyssie talk,

101
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:57,568
we should ask Julia if she is not the
Wishes to continue her mother's work.

102
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:58,746
Are you serious?

103
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:01,709
You need not only to the
Presentation of the diamond care,

00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:04,631
but also the
Safeguards the media.

105
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,056
For this you need experience.

106
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,430
She has my full confidence.

107
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:09,989
See only.
Where is Julia now?

108
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,994
How is one to
leave someone

109
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:14,673
who does not even go to the funeral
her own mother comes.

110
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:28,246
Papa?

111
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,898

I have to go for mom.

121
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:07,634
I can not give it all up now.

122
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:09,716
You could have asked me,
what I think about it, right?

123
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,197
This decision I make alone.

124
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:12,932
I am the one who is
takes care of the insurance.

125
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:14,617
You will work with me!

126
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,777
Do you know what I would have said,
if you had asked me?

127
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:21,100
I would have said no. this stone
is cursed. He just brings misfortune.

128
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,386
Your mother
therefore lost their lives!

129
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:51,929
The jewelry is in this particular konstru--
ated, secure stand presented.

and an electronic chip.

133
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:00,493
Is it possible to imitate?

134
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:03,728
Impossible. They are different
and can not be faked.

135
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,090
During the presentation will be a key
kept by the head of the security company.

00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,075
It organizes the sale.

141
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:26,402
-- Does she have it with you?
-- Yes, it is.

142
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:29,849
To get to the key heranzu--
come, you have to replace it.

143
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:31,847
And for that we need a perfect copy,

144
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:34,396

As for the weight as well.

145
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:36,174

It is the safest
Apartment of the whole hotel.

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,426
Has the key

00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,825
And the floor has only one entrance.

00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:56,586
We have someone in the hotel?

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,886
-- We have the suite prepared for you.
-- Thanks, that's nice.

162
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:36,628
Marie Neuville died of an overdose

163
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:38,457

164
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:42,912
Was found dead in her car.

Yes, I'll meet him immediately.

170
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,309
The Florentin is not
just a precious stone.

171
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:02,657
He is a legend.

172
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,948
We have considered the following,
to bring it to bear.

173
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,839
A stand in a
spiral space that is both open ...

174
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:09,597
... is closed and in themselves.

175
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,444
Guests can here him in an intimate,
admire mysterious atmosphere.

176
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:18,232
The focus of our sales
are the only jewelry,

177
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:19,530
as the Florentin.

178
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:22,532
There are only three objects
auctioned, which are unique.

179
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,918
And thus, this
Detailed auction in history.

180
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:27,733
No one has ever dared
an auction with only a diamond

181
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,724
and a single further
Perform gem.

182
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:33,496
I hope Julia that we
so do not ruin us.

183
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:37,650
Sorry.

184
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,268
I have an important
Message for Mademoiselle Neuville.

185
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:41,422
Yes?

186
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:43,785
Thank You.

187
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:47,860
Gentlemen, we are all
More again in our ...

188
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,180
-- Wait.
-- ... The next meeting to speak on Friday.

189
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,023
-- Who gave you that?
-- A man who wanted to talk.

190
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:52,584
I told him, you
were in a meeting.

191
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:54,362
-- Where is he? -- He's gone.
He could not wait.

192
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:57,548
If we take the Florentin not
more than 40 million sale,

193
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,643
we need this auction
regarded as a failure.

194
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,481
And you have a responsibility.

195
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:08,095
Simon Farrell, National Security Advisor.

196
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:13,660
-- Hello?
-- Simon Farrell?

197
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:15,178
Julia Neuville here.

198
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:41,443
-- If you are Simon Farrell?
-- This is me.

199
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,001
What makes it out, go out to you?

200
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:45,330
This money from you in the
Envelope, I do not understand.

201
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:48,486
These are the 12,000 euro that your
Mother had given me an advance.

202
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:50,976
And of course the
Plans. Here you are.

203
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:54,300
Since everything is in there. And there are
no reason to keep her here.

204
00:15:56,544 --> 00:15:57,615
The plans of what?

205
00:15:57,785 --> 00:16:00,145
The plans of the security system,
and the display tray of LINVAS

206
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:01,699
in the auction house Galley.

207
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,788
I could not but
leave at the reception.

208
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:08,696
The display tray? My mother has given you
given the plans of the safety system?

209
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:10,867
Yes, I should carry out an audit.

210
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,672
And what the issues are in your work?

211
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,200
Her mother did not trust
the safety concepts,

212
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:19,066
follow a simple matrix.

213
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:20,681
You say to them:"jewelry,
Antwerp ", and think:

214
00:16:20,886 --> 00:16:22,482
"No problem, easy money."

215
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:24,881
My task was to
To check the security.

216
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:28,127
Since when do you work for them?

217
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,398
I work for about
ten years, along with your mother.

218
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:32,367
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

219
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:33,880
For which auctions?

220
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,172
The Potemkine, the Petit Sancy 2005

221
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:38,658
the issue of the British
Crown Jewels at the Petit Palais ...

222
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:40,258
A total of about ten.

223
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:44,380
Your most important auctions,
She never told me about it.

224
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,428
Could a
take the later train?

225
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,150
I'm sorry, I have
an appointment in Paris.

226
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:49,912
How did you meet her?

227
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,738
I was the security system of a
great jeweler on the Place Vendôme

228
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:54,472
was in the broken renew.

229
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,711
Her mother has the expertise
created for the insurance.

230
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:58,519
That was '99, I think.

231
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,802
-- Lorenz Bäumer?
-- Julia ...

232
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:03,364
Sorry, your death ...

233
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:05,150
I know how
close they were.

234
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:06,568
They have with them
Lorenz Bäumer know?

235
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,201
I really have to go now.

236
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:09,723
Goodbye.

237
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,379
We must this
Information not pass,

238
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,070
but your mother was a friend.
I'll make an exception.

239
00:17:30,273 --> 00:17:33,026
-- Thank You. -- These data are still
not in the computer. You're too old.

240
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:35,107
-- Good day. -- Good day.
Do you have the documents to Farrel?

241
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:36,115
-- Good day.
-- Yes.

242
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:37,701
Explore alone everything.

243
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,319
Simon Farrell has worked '99 for us

244
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:42,595
when my father
Security System renewed.

245
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:45,628
He has chosen the concept
the monitor monitoring care.

246
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,190
I leave you to Mr Derteau.

247
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,520
Many Thanks.

248
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,049
Electrical Engineer ...

249
00:17:57,218 --> 00:18:00,332
Anxious depressed state
due to the death of the mother.

250
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:04,139
On the right side
you can see the cathedral.

251
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:07,586
It is one of the highlights of the architecture ...

252
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:09,744
... and belongs to
World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

253
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,550
It originated from a
Lady Chapel and was ...

254
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:15,269
Good day.

255
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:16,257
Thank you for coming.

256
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:18,549
See in this jacket
They are very similar to your mother.

257
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,679
I'm thinking about
Their contracts to take over.

258
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:24,785
But I have to more
know about their collaboration.

259
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:26,563
I am not sure,
whether this is a good idea.

260
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,926
Why are you here,
if you do not want?

261
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:31,728
I just ask only
if you want to mimic your mother

262
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,086
or whether the benefits
my services are convinced?

263
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:37,094
Galley, the director, has everything
done to get rid of me.

264
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:40,008
I stand on my first
major auction alone.

265
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,202
And there is one more thing.

266
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,733
My father is around
the insurance care.

267
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:46,375
So what?

268
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:49,702
He has the death of my
Mother not yet been overcome.

269
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:51,143
Do not trust him?

270
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:58,297
Have fun with Michael Wurst
talked about our meeting?

271
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:00,950
Her mother told me,
what he means to you.

272
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:06,195
If you are referring to our affair,
the thing of the past.

273
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:11,083
No, I have Michael
said nothing about it.

274
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:14,205
I just want the plans
My mother pursue,

275
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:16,327
therefore I met you. But ...

276
00:19:17,254 --> 00:19:19,210
... that was probably not a good idea.

277
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:22,009
I see.

278
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:27,181
Nowadays it is very difficult,
trust someone opposed to accommodate.

279
00:19:27,985 --> 00:19:29,820
Nice to have met you.

280
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:34,771
Another bit of advice, Julia.
Ask the security company,

281
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,214
whether the drivers for the
Transport of Florentins are divided,

282
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:38,751
have a driving license.

283
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:44,157
Has anyone of them Somehow
which comments on the procedure

284
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,636
or the proposed contracts?

285
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:48,397
No.

286
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:50,278
-- Good.
-- Yes.

287
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:53,006
I want to see the list of drivers,
for the transport of jewelry

288
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:55,111
from the airport to
Are responsible hotel.

289
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,633
Julia if you name the
all people want to know

290
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,891
dealing with the security
jewelery employ,

291
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:02,087
we sit here next year.

292
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:05,814
I would also like
see their driver's licenses.

293
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:09,141
Is there anything in this way?

294
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:12,380
I will not sign,
without having seen the papers.

295
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,225
You are not serious?

296
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:15,699
Very seriously.

297
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:24,312
-- Would you please tell us the
Get Treaty? -- Yes of course.

298
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:26,870
-- If you please wait briefly.
-- Yes.

299
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:35,125
Here is the list of names
the people from the transport.

300
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:37,688
We will give you the
Give licenses, the driver still.

301
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:41,204
The license of
Monsieur Burlini was collected.

302
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:44,287
I learn just that the
License of Monsieur Burlini,

303
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:48,121
of more than 15 years for us
works, was drafted to August.

304
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,615
But he's only replacement and
is of course not drive.

305
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,380
What happens when a
the driver something happened?

306
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,509
What happens if Monsieur Burlini
has to step in for some reason?

307
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:02,624
Then the diamond is not insured.

308
00:21:02,874 --> 00:21:05,834
So you actually place
a driver than a representation ...

309
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:09,678
... which, if it has to take the wheel, all
Contractual clauses overrides.

310
00:21:11,682 --> 00:21:14,435
We will Monsieur Burlini
exchange, Mademoiselle.

311
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:16,159
I hope so.

312
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:19,043
Ask LINVAS
several deals

313
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,168
for the installation
the hidden cameras.

314
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:22,473
More deals?

315
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:25,966
Was at 80 per cent of all thefts
it complicit in the security companies.

316
00:21:26,697 --> 00:21:29,777
You should so many different
Contract service providers as possible.

317
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:33,693
Thank You.

318
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,406
Everything is recorded.

319
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:37,904
The order, times,
the due dates.

320
00:21:38,307 --> 00:21:40,186
And all this time without the cherry.

321
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,306
You forgot the cherry.

322
00:21:45,395 --> 00:21:47,634
This is the only
Copy that I keep.

323
00:21:47,997 --> 00:21:50,718
They are the same agreements,
as I had with your mother.

324
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,314
Many Thanks.

325
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:53,880
Many Thanks.

326
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:58,798
I'm sorry that I
was the last time so harshly.

327
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:00,990
But this sale
is something special.

328
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,326
My mother has her
life dreamed.

329
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:05,531
Here you are.

330
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:08,971
Julia. Oops, you here?

331
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:11,800
-- Simon, a friend of mom.
-- Well, Michael Wurst.

332
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:15,293
I am the auctioneer of
Sale, the Julia organized.

333
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:16,500
Louise, my wife.

334
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:19,221
-- Good Evening.
-- Good Evening.

335
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:20,849
When is the meeting tomorrow?

336
00:22:20,868 --> 00:22:21,982
At ten clock.

337
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,908
-- Well, I'll see you then.
-- Good.

338
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,013
Have a good evening.

339
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:27,704
-- Have a good evening.
-- Have a good evening.

340
00:22:31,838 --> 00:22:33,914
Do not you find it strange
that he shows up here?

341
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,793
I'm sorry if the
out of tune. But it's just a coincidence.

342
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:38,517
Pure coincidence.

343
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:43,750
One last thing.

344
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,288
I have yet to secure your room.

345
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:46,753
And that means?

346
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:49,196
Check to see if someone Microphones
or cameras has mounted,

347
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:50,974
to gain access to information.

00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:35,998
I'll get my coat only briefly.

523
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,449
-- Good Evening.
-- Good Evening.

524
00:34:45,894 --> 00:34:47,489
I leave you better off alone.

525
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,899
What's the matter with you?

526
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:21,557
This is it, Inès de Boissiere.

527
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:23,558
She lives alone, no
Members, no children.

528
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,326
It's tonight to Benefiz--
Gala Casino invited in the city.

529
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,286
You do not let them out of sight ...

530
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:32,291
... of the moment,
when she enters the casino,

531
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,852
until it leaves again.

532
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:35,274
-- I am delighted to see you.
-- Good Evening.

533
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:37,349
I wish you
a lovely evening.

534
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,552
It's done, you can
get started. She's in there.

535
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:27,117
You can begin.

536
00:37:28,408 --> 00:37:30,123
I'll do a five minute break.

537
00:37:53,912 --> 00:37:57,473
LIFT OUT OF SERVICE

538
00:39:08,743 --> 00:39:10,054
I have to go.

539
00:39:10,945 --> 00:39:12,616
-- What time is it?
-- Late.

540
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:16,583
Hey, still remains a bit.

541
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:49,138
-- Have a nice evening.
-- Good Night.

542
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:50,976
Thank you very much.

543
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:13,040
Here we are,
my darling. Come Over.

544
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:23,891
Come on, go. Mama
takes off her coat.

545
00:40:26,136 --> 00:40:27,490
It's all right.

546
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:45,748
No.

547
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:47,309
No, no.

548
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:53,312
Hello?

549
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:58,837
Niko! Come here!
Go quickly, come here!

550
00:40:59,408 --> 00:41:00,882
Take the curtain cords!
Come on!

551
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,166
-- Hello? -- God! What did
you built for a shit!

552
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:06,929
You had nothing else to do than
to monitor them and warn us!

553
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:08,649
Because of you, she is now dead.

554
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:11,132
What is this
hot, she's dead?

555
00:41:26,112 --> 00:41:27,511
-- What is fucking wrong?
-- I messed up.

556
00:41:27,835 --> 00:41:29,898
The old woman came home
while the others were there.

557
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:31,338
I am to blame for her death.

558
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,260
-- Who beat you up?
-- You hold out there.

559
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:34,341
Did you beat him?

560
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,720
It has nothing to with it
do. He was not there.

561
00:41:41,407 --> 00:41:42,839
-- Come here, you asshole!
-- Take it easy!

562
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:44,200
I would have him
to kill.

563
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,792
If you see him again
touch her, I'll kill you!

564
00:41:45,812 --> 00:41:48,314
He has ruined everything! this
Idiot! This old bag!

565
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,597
Let me go! Come here,
you asshole! Come here!

566
00:41:50,616 --> 00:41:52,047
Let's go, go.

567
00:42:17,922 --> 00:42:18,993
Yes?

568
00:42:21,646 --> 00:42:22,760
Here.

569
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:24,645
I'm done.

570
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:33,447
I cut it off, Simon.
I'm going back to Paris.

571
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:35,088
-- Have you talked with Scylla?
-- Yes.

572
00:42:35,379 --> 00:42:37,291
We have arranged for us
because of the coal.

573
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,736
I'm too old for this job.

574
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:46,178
Have a nice day, buddy.

575
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,341
What will you do with that?

576
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:52,027
Can you drive so ever?

577
00:42:52,474 --> 00:42:53,589
Yes.

578
00:43:01,484 --> 00:43:02,521
Simon.

579
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:04,787
I'm in a meeting.
I do not have much time.

580
00:43:04,806 --> 00:43:06,789
There is one detail about the
We have not talked yesterday.

581
00:43:06,808 --> 00:43:08,567
I thought we were
gone through everything.

582
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,122
Seriously, Julia,
listen to me. Okay?

583
00:43:11,613 --> 00:43:13,568
It's about the key for the installer.

584
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:15,814
The Safety Officer
has the first key,

585
00:43:16,057 --> 00:43:17,728
and I do not want
that you have the second.

586
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:19,293
Give him Galley.

587
00:43:20,101 --> 00:43:21,292
Are you worried?

588
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:24,298
Tell the people of LINVAS that ...

589
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:26,745
... you do not feel comfortable,
if you have the key with you.

590
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,338
-- All Right?
-- Yes.

591
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,141
I'm serious, Julia.

592
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:33,390
Are you okay?

593
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:35,071
Yes.

594
00:43:35,235 --> 00:43:37,988
I must return today to
Exhibition here I am again.

595
00:43:45,965 --> 00:43:48,685
It is the key in the evening
the auction does not have with him.

596
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:51,721
The Security Service has
decided that Galley will have him.

597
00:43:53,012 --> 00:43:55,207
The goal is now so someone else.

598
00:44:14,993 --> 00:44:16,708
Have you bought a new clock?

599
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:19,030
Yes, I treated myself to something.

600
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:20,956
A little something, after all.

601
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:22,553
From time to time.

602
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,276
Do not you have
Boredom so out of work?

603
00:44:26,804 --> 00:44:28,879
But already, but I am concerned.

604
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:33,123
Hello.

605
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:34,688
Listen ...

606
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:36,362
What?

607
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,125
No, I never said that!

608
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:45,843
Wait a moment, please.

609
00:44:45,862 --> 00:44:48,461
Simon, please, go yet
and get us two coffees.

610
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,663
The machine is back in the hallway.

611
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:56,145
Just look at this! This may be the
Penner not do that to me!

612
00:44:56,312 --> 00:44:57,863
Damn, what
all this shit?

613
00:44:58,554 --> 00:45:00,433
How can my
Integrity question?

614
00:45:00,596 --> 00:45:02,956
-- Sorry.
-- This is already.

615
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,068
-- If you already go.
-- Absolutely.

616
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:08,264
No.

617
00:45:08,283 --> 00:45:09,879
Not look his game?

618
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:16,071
No, a second,
quite uncertain.

619
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:18,286
Yes, exactly.
Bye.

620
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:23,732
I stand by me here in the legs
the abdomen, just so he tells me,

621
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:25,249
I would have more
effort. I'm tired.

622
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:27,802
-- Thank You. -- I'm tired
more on this shit.

623
00:45:27,821 --> 00:45:29,372
Come, age, let us
do something else.

624
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:31,382
I am what intervening
come. I need to court.

625
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:32,728
I'll take you with me.
We talk in the car.

626
00:45:32,747 --> 00:45:34,178
No, not necessary.
Do Not Worry.

627
00:45:34,988 --> 00:45:37,741
I come alone clear. yet
this, it is the other way.

628
00:45:41,314 --> 00:45:43,030
Thanks for the coffee.
Goodbye.

629
00:45:43,196 --> 00:45:45,391
-- Goodbye. -- Here you can read it
everything! What do you want more?

630
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:47,477
Hey, man, now tell
but also something.

631
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:06,369
Attention to track three,
incoming train from Marseille.

632
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:08,454
Arrival 16 clock past eleven.

633
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,659
Be careful when passing train.

634
00:46:31,162 --> 00:46:32,276
-- All aboard.
-- Good day, Madame.

635
00:46:32,443 --> 00:46:35,587
Be careful with the departure of the train.
The doors close automatically.

636
00:46:35,606 --> 00:46:37,277
Your compartment is a
Little further forward.

637
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:50,050
Good day.

638
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,616
Lieutenant Fauré and Kopel of the Cid.

639
00:46:53,222 --> 00:46:55,659
-- Monsieur Delcourt?
-- Yes. What's up?

640
00:46:57,027 --> 00:46:58,742
Please get in.

641
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:03,582
What are you doing here?

642
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,455
One of my prisoners on parole

643
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:07,506
is on a train to
Antwerp risen, though he ...

644
00:47:07,756 --> 00:47:09,067
Although he Paris
allowed to leave any circumstances.

645
00:47:09,238 --> 00:47:12,515
Simon Carrera is on the way
Antwerp. He plans a robbery.

646
00:47:14,203 --> 00:47:16,759
We wish him and his
Catch people in the act.

647
00:47:18,687 --> 00:47:20,085
But I have to follow the rules

648
00:47:20,248 --> 00:47:21,750
and inform the judge
and the gendarmerie.

649
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:23,889
If we arrest them before, are
they get out in three or four years.

650
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,446
Judge Rousselot has already been informed.

651
00:47:25,734 --> 00:47:28,196
Until we have arrested them do
You as though everything as always.

652
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:31,897
Routine stop. If anything
happen, call me.

653
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,283
Understood in this country
you what it means to forge.

654
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,126
These are real forgeries. than
whether it would create.

655
00:48:07,332 --> 00:48:10,370
The guy who did it, white
exactly as working time.

656
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:12,288
That should be sold as a masterpiece.

657
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:14,730
He has certainly taken days,
to select color.

658
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,941
He's got a zirconium with a very
high radiation reflective found.

659
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,818
Even the edges are sharp.

660
00:48:20,385 --> 00:48:22,897
He does not even have a
used electric grinder.

661
00:48:23,988 --> 00:48:25,507
Everything by hand.

662
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:29,307
With infinite patience, as
he had invented the loops.

663
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:52,653
Many Thanks.

664
00:48:53,336 --> 00:48:54,975
-- Hello, Blanche.
-- Hello, Julia.

665
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,330
I'm happy to be here.

666
00:48:58,381 --> 00:49:00,294
I'm sure you'll be thrilled.

667
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,315
Good Evening.

668
00:49:58,598 --> 00:49:59,757
Thank you very much.

669
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:08,518
Monsieur Galley, tell us
about the safety precautions.

670
00:50:08,687 --> 00:50:10,720
Furthermore, I would like
reveal too much.

671
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,851
As you know, was this diamond
long time as gone.

672
00:50:14,013 --> 00:50:16,013
-- Because no other room is available?
-- Like I said, Madame,

673
00:50:16,175 --> 00:50:18,567
i am very sorry,
All rooms are fully booked.

674
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:22,130
But do not worry.
3--2--2, I'll send someone.

675
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:26,102
-- Could you check that? Would that be possible?
-- Yes. I'll have a look.

676
00:51:40,294 --> 00:51:41,606
Ground floor at the command center.

677
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,043
This command center.

678
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:50,095
An elevator is plugging--in
remained on the fifth floor.

679
00:52:21,854 --> 00:52:23,405
-- Good Evening.
-- Good Evening.

680
00:52:26,178 --> 00:52:27,400
-- Here you go.
-- Thank you.

681
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:28,938
-- Have a nice evening.
-- Thank You.

682
00:52:35,147 --> 00:52:37,129
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

683
00:52:37,148 --> 00:52:38,186
And respect.

684
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,262
Fantastic.

685
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:41,830
That was great.

686
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:43,415
Nice to have you here.

687
00:52:43,434 --> 00:52:45,871
Julia, dear, many
Thanks for the invitation.

688
00:52:46,077 --> 00:52:48,860
I have the Florentin
seen. He is wonderful.

689
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:52,232
This reminds me of the time when
did you get your mother to the studio.

690
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:54,121
You were still a very little girl.

691
00:52:56,687 --> 00:52:59,888
It was just amazing.
So what I've never seen.

692
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,365
Have in this chandelier
We found the diamond.

693
00:53:15,384 --> 00:53:18,257
It was founded in 1918 with a
Jeweler commissioned.

694
00:53:18,547 --> 00:53:22,349
He had to cut 99 crystals in the form
a double rose, like the Florentin.

695
00:53:22,551 --> 00:53:24,310
When we counted, it was the 100th

696
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:26,192
One too many.

697
00:53:26,475 --> 00:53:28,147
The 100th was the Florentin.

698
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:32,955
Come Over.

699
00:53:34,523 --> 00:53:36,238
Please make behind us.

700
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,451
-- Have you seen him before?
-- No.

701
00:54:10,316 --> 00:54:11,835
My little girl.

702
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,062
-- You look gorgeous.
-- Thank you, Papa.

703
00:54:15,082 --> 00:54:16,583
May I Simon
imagine a friend.

704
00:54:16,602 --> 00:54:17,597
-- My father, Pierre Neuville.
-- Nice to meet you.

705
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:20,524
Are you here for the story
here or in case of diamonds?

706
00:54:21,006 --> 00:54:23,202
-- I'm here because of Julia.
-- That's the best reason.

707
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:24,831
Excuse me,
I'll be right back.

708
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:26,925
-- Pierre.
-- Ah, Philippe.

709
00:54:27,373 --> 00:54:29,612
Philippe de Mazières,
I can imagine, that's ...

710
00:54:29,855 --> 00:54:31,614
-- Simon.
-- Simon, a friend of Julia.

711
00:54:31,777 --> 00:54:32,815
-- Nice to meet you.
-- Nice to meet you.

712
00:54:33,018 --> 00:54:34,297
You can count themselves lucky.

713
00:54:34,499 --> 00:54:36,412
familiar Julia
not so easy anyone.

714
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:38,644
-- How did they do it?
-- Do not reply.

715
00:54:38,664 --> 00:54:42,448
Philippe was ambassador to Djibouti.
It is a kind of occupational disease.

716
00:54:42,467 --> 00:54:45,143
He mixes everywhere
and creates a file on each.

717
00:54:56,641 --> 00:54:57,952
Nice to have you here.

718
00:55:03,527 --> 00:55:05,079
Please make behind us.

719
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:07,151
Here is a customer.

720
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,602
Got it.

721
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:24,700
The key is in there now.

722
00:55:43,565 --> 00:55:44,515
They rise up again.

723
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:18,151
-- Hands up!
-- Get down!

724
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:20,517
On the ground! Get down!

725
00:56:21,841 --> 00:56:23,152
You, hands up!

726
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,318
Come on, over here!

727
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:55,146
Thank You.

728
00:56:55,873 --> 00:56:57,576
First, I would like to
Thank you all,

729
00:56:57,595 --> 00:56:59,671
you to this
Exhibition came.

730
00:56:59,957 --> 00:57:02,830
I feel by
Their presence very honored.

731
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:08,163
Let me begin by saying a few
Words about the diamonds to say.

732
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,241
maybe knew
Do not let it, but ...

733
00:57:11,008 --> 00:57:13,968
... is Florentin,
without a doubt, the diamond,

734
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:16,130
the story
most coined.

735
00:57:16,373 --> 00:57:20,054
For the first time in 1471 in the possession
mentioned the Bold Charles,

736
00:57:20,257 --> 00:57:22,376
heard this famous gem ...
-- It's your turn.

737
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:24,294
... of more than 137 carats ...

738
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:29,656
... and with 126 facets to the first
European cut diamonds ...

739
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:32,545
... and the most beautiful
of the Christian era.

740
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:34,180
I should bring you.

741
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:35,909
Ah, okay. All right, thank you.

742
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:38,708
Murder and dramas revolve
around the historic jewel,

743
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:41,270
a showpiece of the
Ark of the Habsburgs.

744
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:46,022
From the beloved Mayer compact up to Empress
Sissi has this gem turned heads,

745
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:48,478
Sown discord and
incited to murder.

746
00:57:48,644 --> 00:57:52,118
A diamond that -- the legend
for -- its owners bring bad luck.

747
00:57:52,847 --> 00:57:54,006
No, thank you.

748
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,406
It means that all
Gems have a memory.

749
00:57:57,772 --> 00:57:59,554
I believe that the Florentin ...

750
00:57:59,574 --> 00:58:01,837
... an imprint of all
Person carries within itself,

751
00:58:01,856 --> 00:58:03,615
in with him
Contact came.

752
00:58:03,858 --> 00:58:07,522
I would like to mention one that
has helped to make new celebrity

753
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:09,332
by having rediscovered it.

754
00:58:09,784 --> 00:58:11,542
My mother, Marie Neuville.

755
00:58:15,348 --> 00:58:16,867
Thank you very much.

756
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,582
What's going on?

757
00:58:29,522 --> 00:58:30,637
What's up?

758
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:35,604
Blanche.

759
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:37,643
Is there a doctor in the room?

760
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,449
What about her?

761
00:58:40,452 --> 00:58:43,653
Excuse me, but
is there a doctor here in the hall?

762
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:50,018
-- Here we go.
-- Okay.

763
00:58:52,664 --> 00:58:53,581
Driving off.

764
00:59:03,154 --> 00:59:04,793
Hurry up!

765
00:59:05,797 --> 00:59:06,911

Monsieur?

769
00:59:27,817 --> 00:59:30,012
This is the director. I am
the organizer of the auction.

I do need to
Key he has with him.

00:59:32,022 --> 00:59:34,742
-- Do you belong to the family?
-- No, we work together.

772
00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:37,728
If you want, we call
Safety Officers

773
00:59:37,747 --> 00:59:40,226

they really need the key.

774

Okay.

775

You know what? Mind
you serve your guests.

776
00:59:45,354 --> 00:59:46,829
I'm trying
find out what's going on.

777
00:59:50,759 --> 00:59:52,310
Many Thanks.

778
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:14,015
Caution, let us through!

779
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:28,108
Do you have any idea what's going on?

780
01:00:28,515 --> 01:00:30,306
A few guests fainting.

781
01:00:30,837 --> 01:00:32,432
-- I'll go look.
-- Okay.

782
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:54,734
We are the gain. We guard
the diamonds until everything has calmed down.

Please confirm request.

784
01:00:58,143 --> 01:00:59,093
Let them through.

785
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:06,621
If one has sent you? Good ...

786
01:01:25,889 --> 01:01:27,440
-- Mademoiselle Neuville?
-- Yes?

787
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:29,807
-- Lieutenant Fauré, BRB.
-- Yes?

788
01:01:30,013 --> 01:01:31,367
You have just been mugged.

789
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:34,651
Evacuation or change your
Guests arises without panic.

790
01:01:40,983 --> 01:01:44,488
Ladies and gentlemen, I beg you
To remain calm and to leave the room,

Out of the way!

798

The fire extinguisher.

799
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:07,522
Go, go!

800
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,644
-- Police!

801
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:12,443
-- I want to see your hands!
-- On the floor!

802
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,941
Monsieur, you are wrong,
this man works for me.

803
01:02:23,784 --> 01:02:26,296
Simon, tell him.
Tell him yet.

804
01:02:35,995 --> 01:02:37,306
Climbing because over there!

805
01:02:44,084 --> 01:02:45,602
Mademoiselle Neuville, a comment!

806
01:02:45,765 --> 01:02:46,907
Let's go through please.

807
01:02:46,926 --> 01:02:49,406
-- Please, post a comment!
-- What happened?

808
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:03,019
Sorry, Telephone
for you, Monsieur Galley.

809
01:03:03,422 --> 01:03:04,896
-- Hello?
-- The Key ...

810
01:03:05,063 --> 01:03:06,375
I no longer have it.

811
01:03:06,545 --> 01:03:08,817
Do not worry, I have.
The jewelry is safe.

812
01:03:09,627 --> 01:03:10,698
Where are they?

813
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,692
Somewhere in the harbor at the docks.

814
01:03:13,712 --> 01:03:16,014
Stay there, I'll call the police.

815
01:03:16,034 --> 01:03:17,912
-- I need to talk to a police officer.
-- There's nobody more.

816
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:19,714
The police just moved away.

817
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:23,109
Call to the police.

818
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:30,517
We made it!

819
01:04:01,676 --> 01:04:02,835
Okay.

820
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,791
But that's impossible!

821
01:04:06,761 --> 01:04:09,361
They claim that there was
no police action.

822
01:04:09,644 --> 01:04:10,474
Nothing.

823
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:17,889
Give me your mobile phone.

824
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:38,029
So what?

825
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:47,758
Could not have gone better!

826
01:08:42,223 --> 01:08:45,216
The police this morning
an abandoned boat found.

827
01:08:45,466 --> 01:08:48,546
It should involve the yacht,
with the gangsters fled.

828
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:51,348
It is believed that the
Complicity in the distribution of prey

829
01:08:51,511 --> 01:08:52,823
have killed each other ...

830
01:08:53,033 --> 01:08:55,829
... and in this massacre
were no survivors.

831
01:08:55,995 --> 01:08:58,716
In one discovered in the water
Body was one of the earrings found

832
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:00,510
the necklace was in the dinghy.

833
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,640
Probably the Florentin is on the

834
01:09:04,604 --> 01:09:06,756
Simon Carrera
the theft organized.

835
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:09,469
Together with the
former soldiers Frank Scylla.

836
01:09:09,488 --> 01:09:11,127
From him we have found blood.

837
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:14,690
See Carrera and Frank Scylla,
At the two closely.

838
01:09:15,374 --> 01:09:17,406
Am I your photo
place in the middle of it?

839
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:21,370
This has the police on
boat found.

840
01:09:22,981 --> 01:09:25,374
You have him complete the
Security plans handed.

841
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:26,942
And this shall have no meaning?

842
01:09:27,105 --> 01:09:29,408
Did I say that this is not
Has meaning? Did I say that?

843
01:09:29,427 --> 01:09:31,023
Calm down please, Julia.

844
01:09:35,874 --> 01:09:38,386
He did not need the plans. he
just needed access to my room,

845
01:09:38,556 --> 01:09:39,617
to get to the safe.

846
01:09:39,637 --> 01:09:41,953
Was not too hard in your
Rooms come, that's for sure.

847
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,621
-- Hard to believe.
-- I have to ask though.

848
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,957
Make it clear to her that she in
Be reckoned with even more prison

849
01:09:46,163 --> 01:09:47,038
than just sarcasm!

850
01:09:47,324 --> 01:09:49,467
We witness a lot of witnesses.

851
01:09:49,487 --> 01:09:51,989
Here, for example, by
a certain Michael Wurst.

852
01:09:52,008 --> 01:09:54,805
He has underestimated its statement
written and is ready to swear

853
01:09:55,011 --> 01:09:57,163
that he Neuville Julia and Simon Carrera

854
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:59,757
in the bar Le Vintage
has seen on 14 April.

855
01:09:59,776 --> 01:10:02,977
And then, even in their private suite
at the Grand Hotel on the seventh May

856
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:04,971
Three days before the
Exhibition of diamonds.

857
01:10:05,461 --> 01:10:08,302
And saw in his view,
not straight from work.

858
01:10:08,624 --> 01:10:10,700
I know that with
this guy were in bed.

859
01:10:10,987 --> 01:10:14,264
Is there more things, in which
You're stuck with it under a blanket?

860
01:11:25,056 --> 01:11:26,455
Do not move!

861
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:30,532
On your knees!

862
01:11:30,943 --> 01:11:32,494
On your knees!

863
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:34,979
Is he with you?

864
01:11:35,747 --> 01:11:37,222
Answer me!

865
01:11:39,551 --> 01:11:42,904
Scylla. I want to know where he is.

866
01:11:45,316 --> 01:11:47,228
Scylla is dead.
What are you talking about?

867
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:50,318
He lives. what about me
was supposed to be dead.

868
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:53,441
Your little dispute, your return
to Paris, all just a false match.

869
01:11:53,644 --> 01:11:55,916
-- What are you talking about? Have ..
-- Do not fuck with me!

870
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:03,163
Tell me what you're up.

871
01:12:03,773 --> 01:12:05,292
I do not know.

872
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:09,653
I know nothing about it, Simon.
That is the truth.

873
01:12:19,308 --> 01:12:21,611
We can no longer
keep in police custody.

874
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,574
Read your statement, which must
You sign before you go.

875
01:12:24,593 --> 01:12:27,030
You can return to the hotel, but
You can not leave the country.

876
01:12:27,235 --> 01:12:30,348
Please, go back.
Let us through.

877
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,272
Let us through.

878
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:39,717
First, I want all employees
and customers of the house Galley say

879
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:43,752
Julia Neuville of all
their functions was delivered.

880
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:45,487
And irrevocable.

881
01:12:47,575 --> 01:12:49,967
Tell me everything,
what you know about Scylla.

882
01:12:50,858 --> 01:12:54,058
Before this job, when did
you see him last time?

883
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:57,261
Twelve, thirteen years ago,
he was stationed in Djibouti.

884
01:12:57,464 --> 01:13:00,248
He came for two weeks after
France returns. I was his driver.

885
01:13:00,267 --> 01:13:01,818
What did he do in Djibouti?

886
01:13:02,189 --> 01:13:05,389
He was military attaché at the
Message or something.

887
01:13:07,353 --> 01:13:08,905
French Ambassador, Djibouti.

888
01:13:12,519 --> 01:13:14,878
Chronological list of Ambassadors.

889
01:13:21,367 --> 01:13:24,043
De Mézières, Ambassador 1999th

890
01:13:26,892 --> 01:13:29,132
I know Philippe de Mézières.
He was on the auction.

891
01:13:29,495 --> 01:13:33,012
He is a friend of Julia's father
and he was Ambassador to Djibouti.

892
01:13:33,418 --> 01:13:34,601
You think that's not a coincidence?

893
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,498
Philippe de Mézières
under suspicion of corruption.

894
01:13:38,783 --> 01:13:40,422
He has something to hide.

895
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:47,422
Death of Giullah, Angolep.

896
01:13:47,671 --> 01:13:50,348
The commercial agent was
found dead in his car.

897
01:13:51,675 --> 01:13:52,987
Circumstances unclear.

898
01:13:53,757 --> 01:13:55,877
Car from the inside
closed, circumstances unclear.

899
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,721
Diagnosed coroner
Overdose of his medication.

900
01:14:04,248 --> 01:14:06,684
Ambassador Philippe de Mézières
escapes assassination.

901
01:14:21,904 --> 01:14:22,975
Thank You.

902
01:14:35,597 --> 01:14:37,268
Meet in front of the hotel.

903
01:14:47,168 --> 01:14:48,951
De Mézières behind Scylla.

904
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:50,753
And so it looks like a quarrel,

905
01:14:50,772 --> 01:14:53,852
they all are slaughtered and
then disappeared with the diamonds.

906
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:57,215
-- I know you.
-- I am a friend of Simon.

907
01:14:57,378 --> 01:15:00,491
Scylla was going to kill him, as the
else, but he managed to escape.

908
01:15:00,981 --> 01:15:02,215
Wait.

909
01:15:02,622 --> 01:15:05,126
Simon has a lot of chances,
when he came back here,

910
01:15:05,145 --> 01:15:07,568
just to give you these documents
to give you the relief.

911
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,226
-- The he can give the police.
-- You need to decide

912
01:15:09,389 --> 01:15:10,788
when you hold them in your hand.

913
01:15:11,071 --> 01:15:13,463
The photograph is a
small part of the truth.

914
01:15:56,674 --> 01:15:58,433
Did you see the picture?

915
01:15:58,756 --> 01:16:00,231
Did you amused yourself well?

916
01:16:00,718 --> 01:16:04,519
It was too easy. I was still
rumzukriegen easier than you thought.

917
01:16:05,162 --> 01:16:08,243
What happened between us,
Julia had nothing to do with it.

918
01:16:10,407 --> 01:16:12,483
Do you know what hurts the most?

919
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:15,362
That you my mother
have used, even though she's dead.

920
01:16:16,252 --> 01:16:18,011
Not even you've respected.

921
01:16:18,735 --> 01:16:19,957
Did you like
an asshole listed.

922
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:22,039
-- I'm like you, I've lost everything.
-- You're not like me!

923
01:16:22,058 --> 01:16:23,730
You'll never be like me!

924
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,893
Julia. I will help you.

925
01:16:27,062 --> 01:16:29,903
I've brought you documents with
which you can prove the truth.

926
01:16:30,306 --> 01:16:32,969
-- Why should I view it?
-- Because you concerns directly.

927
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,971
Listen to me, what I have to tell you.

928
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:36,973
Then I'll take you to the hotel
back and you never hear from me again.

929
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:38,423
Why should I listen to you?

930
01:16:38,713 --> 01:16:40,025
What can you tell me?

931
01:16:40,515 --> 01:16:41,914
More lies?

932
01:16:42,357 --> 01:16:45,558
Can you even three sets of
give you without lying? Three words?

933
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,439
Only three words without
to lie, can you?

934
01:16:47,722 --> 01:16:50,039
You show up here on easy and I
to listen to your stories.

935
01:16:51,205 --> 01:16:52,003
You used me.

936
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:54,806
Yes, I have used you. but what
happened, happened. It's over.

937
01:16:55,009 --> 01:16:56,321
It's over?

938
01:16:56,531 --> 01:16:59,252
That's all? No regrets,
Nothing? Simply, it's over.

939
01:16:59,814 --> 01:17:02,277
Why are you here, if I do not even
can explain what I have to tell you?

940
01:17:02,296 --> 01:17:04,329
I wanted to see you in the eye,
before you walk in the slammer!

941
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,920
Will you let me be arrested?

942
01:17:05,939 --> 01:17:07,842
-- Come on, I'm here.
Take me behind bars! -- Yes!

943
01:17:07,861 --> 01:17:09,413
-- That you want?
-- That's what I want!

944
01:17:09,823 --> 01:17:10,982
So go ahead, to call.

945
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:13,617
Call! What is?

946
01:17:14,828 --> 01:17:16,663
Are you scared?

947
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,951
How could I be so blind?

948
01:17:23,276 --> 01:17:24,795
How could I trust you only?

949
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,118
Because of you have
humiliated me.

950
01:17:29,362 --> 01:17:31,064
Do what you want.
I will never forgive you.

951
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:33,236
Damn, I need it to you
because rub their nose?

952
01:17:33,526 --> 01:17:37,120
Listen, the Ambassador de Mézières
escaped yesterday just an assassination attempt.

953
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:40,370
Rather a settlement under
Gangsters as a political act.

954
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,648
-- Was that the reaction to the death of
Monsieur Giullah ... -- I do not listen.

955
01:17:42,895 --> 01:17:44,397
... who was found dead in his car?

956
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:47,617
Do you understand, dead in his
Car under mysterious circumstances!

957
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,091
The doors were locked from the inside.

958
01:17:51,543 --> 01:17:54,656
Cause of death:a
Overdose of his medication.

959
01:17:55,947 --> 01:17:59,180
That's impossible.
That can not be.

960
01:18:01,672 --> 01:18:03,704
Are you saying that
have killed my mother?

961
01:18:03,874 --> 01:18:05,297
You have killed her,
and you did not know it?

962
01:18:05,316 --> 01:18:07,459
-- No, I did not know.
-- You lie, you bastard!

963
01:18:07,478 --> 01:18:10,351
-- You did it!
-- Stop it, calm down!

964
01:18:10,961 --> 01:18:12,272
Stop it!

965
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:25,533
There's something Julia. Scylla
had a mole at the auction ...

966
01:18:26,616 --> 01:18:29,696
... access to documents
had the security company.

967
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,296
Do you understand what that means?

968
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:36,059
No, I do not understand.

969
01:18:36,346 --> 01:18:38,301
Someone who knew de Mézières ...

970
01:18:39,268 --> 01:18:41,223
... the galley knew ...

971
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,785
... of your mother knew.

972
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:48,146
Someone you know.

973
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:51,674
No, I can not.

974
01:18:52,601 --> 01:18:54,513
Only you can figure it out.

975
01:18:55,804 --> 01:18:57,355
I do not have the strength.

976
01:19:31,677 --> 01:19:33,348
What are you doing here?

977
01:19:34,801 --> 01:19:37,357
I smoke again. So what?

978
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,363
What's this?

979
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,923
De Mézières with Frank Scylla.

980
01:19:49,455 --> 01:19:52,011
De Mézières is your closest friend.

981
01:19:52,618 --> 01:19:56,092
Did you know that he is suspicious, jeman--
to have murdered, who stood in his way?

982
01:19:56,301 --> 01:20:00,299
The autopsy revealed that the victim
died from an overdose of a drug.

983
01:20:01,345 --> 01:20:02,864
That was never proven.

984
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:07,228
She knew it, right?

985
01:20:09,033 --> 01:20:10,387
Mama?

986
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:14,792
You knew that you give them the
Security concept handed had.

987
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,396
You told them,
that she is diabetic.

988
01:20:18,682 --> 01:20:20,802
So it her death as a
Could make it look accident.

989
01:20:21,004 --> 01:20:22,643
How can you believe such a thing?

990
01:20:22,806 --> 01:20:25,602
I'm calling the police.
Then you can tell them everything.

991
01:20:25,889 --> 01:20:27,408
Do not call the police.

992
01:20:27,611 --> 01:20:30,090
I'll tell you everything I know
but I beg you, no police.

993
01:20:30,253 --> 01:20:32,253
I would
Prison not survive.

994
01:20:32,575 --> 01:20:33,930
I did not believe it.

995
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:35,776
You killed them.

996
01:20:35,979 --> 01:20:38,011
No! That's not true!

997
01:20:40,984 --> 01:20:43,737
When your mother's plans
had discovered, I was scared.

998
01:20:43,906 --> 01:20:46,899
I talked to Philippe, and
He said I'll take care of it.

999
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:50,624
I was relieved. I thought he would
already find a solution to anything.

1000
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:52,745
And then Scylla killed her.

1001
01:20:54,195 --> 01:20:57,516
He killed her.
But I did not want.

1002
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,479
I swear,
I did not want.

1003
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:05,924
Julia, we must do so,
like you know nothing about it.

1004
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:08,888
If they find out that I with
have spoken to you, I'm dead.

1005
01:21:32,272 --> 01:21:33,791
Sit down.

1006
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:42,235
No one will hurt you.

1007
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:45,558
You just have us all
tell me what you know.

1008
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,245
Are we clear?

1009
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:53,689
The exchange is tomorrow
held in Luxembourg.

1010
01:21:54,133 --> 01:21:58,197
I do not know where I should at
Jacob Sturm wait with the expert.

1011
01:21:58,216 --> 01:22:00,609
It will examine whether the
Diamond is real.

1012
01:22:00,819 --> 01:22:02,971
The buyer will then pick me up.

1013
01:22:04,022 --> 01:22:05,574
Do you know the buyers?

1014
01:22:05,743 --> 01:22:08,607
Yes, he is a Russian,
Alexander Grenienko.

1015
01:22:08,626 --> 01:22:12,504
I've seen it in the gem market
introduced. He wants me to go with him.

1016
01:22:13,551 --> 01:22:17,025
And Scylla and de Mézières
bring the diamonds?

1017
01:22:17,195 --> 01:22:20,308
Yes, they are already there, but I
do not know exactly what they're up to.

1018
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,071
I swear, the
is all I know.

1019
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:58,223
The expert! Who is the expert?

1020
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:01,754
Eleonore Gretel, a Dutch woman.

1021
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:06,194
Scylla and de Mézières,
know it?

1022
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:07,760
No.

1023
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:15,247
You will call them and cancel it.

1024
01:23:24,418 --> 01:23:26,014
-- Hello.
-- Hello, Julia.

1025
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:31,221
Come, come to my office.

1026
01:23:34,107 --> 01:23:35,866
I need your expertise.

1027
01:24:02,654 --> 01:24:04,445
-- Here you go.
-- Thank You.

1028
01:24:15,106 --> 01:24:16,538
Look at him.

1029
01:24:22,233 --> 01:24:26,274
You see, I have to support something
increased in order to hide the copy.

1030
01:24:27,638 --> 01:24:31,636
You have to copy the original
exchange. And since it gets tricky.

1031
01:24:31,922 --> 01:24:33,396
Look through.

1032
01:24:46,896 --> 01:24:50,937
It has to be fast. It must be so off
see, as if you position the stone.

1033
01:24:51,581 --> 01:24:53,055
So, try it.

1034
01:25:13,882 --> 01:25:16,362
You will not make it.

1035
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:24,929
I can not make it.

1036
01:25:25,813 --> 01:25:26,972
Try it.

1037
01:26:01,647 --> 01:26:03,526
Please pass good care of yourself.

1038
01:26:06,972 --> 01:26:11,931
LUXEMBOURG

1039
01:26:34,839 --> 01:26:36,030
-- Hello, Alexander.
-- Hey.

1040
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,199
-- May I introduce the
Eleanor is Gretel. -- Hello.

1041
01:26:38,442 --> 01:26:39,393
Hello.

1042
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:20,112
A bench. You want to exchange
make in a bank. Unbelievable.

1043
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:22,674
The Russian has the money safely
deposited in a locker.

1044
01:27:23,164 --> 01:27:25,481
If all goes well,
leave them as the diamond.

1045
01:27:26,087 --> 01:27:28,928
They go with anything purely
and come out with nothing.

1046
01:27:30,171 --> 01:27:31,406
Are you going to visit to see?

1047
01:28:02,281 --> 01:28:03,756
Good day.

1048
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:13,242
This way.

1049
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,048
Sit down there.

1050
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:27,995
-- Monsieur Grenienko.
-- Hello, Philippe.

1051
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:29,834
-- Hello.
-- Hello.

1052
01:31:07,256 --> 01:31:09,736
-- Are you sure?
-- A fake.

1053
01:31:10,539 --> 01:31:13,216
A beautiful fake.
But made of zirconium.

1054
01:31:13,623 --> 01:31:16,376
-- What did you say?
-- He is the original.

1055
01:31:17,627 --> 01:31:19,409
Is there any doubt?

1056
01:31:19,428 --> 01:31:21,624
I'm 100 percent sure.

1057
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:24,583
I have this thing since
Evening not lost sight of.

1058
01:31:26,194 --> 01:31:28,073
I'm just telling you what I see.

1059
01:31:30,799 --> 01:31:32,822
You can open. We are done.

1060
01:31:32,841 --> 01:31:34,632
Monsieur Grenienko, wait ...

1061
01:31:34,842 --> 01:31:36,798
I do not know what happened.

1062
01:31:38,086 --> 01:31:41,647
Bring back the money to the
Locker and let them out.

1063
01:31:57,865 --> 01:31:59,099
That's incredible.

1064
01:31:59,907 --> 01:32:01,305
Unbelievable.

1065
01:32:01,628 --> 01:32:03,660
Julia has issued a fake.

1066
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:05,545
-- And did not you know?
-- If I had known it,

1067
01:32:05,712 --> 01:32:07,428
do you think I would have said nothing?

1068
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:49,414
Can I have one? I have
My Hotel forgotten.

1069
01:32:49,433 --> 01:32:53,431
Yes, Philippe, I smoke again
after 30 years, even though Julia ...

1070
01:32:55,479 --> 01:32:56,998
Julia.

1071
01:33:04,168 --> 01:33:05,709
Is he in there?

1072
01:33:05,728 --> 01:33:07,684
Stop it!

1073
01:33:08,451 --> 01:33:10,514
You can not help it.
I have everything organized.

1074
01:33:10,533 --> 01:33:11,932
I will give you the diamond.

1075
01:33:12,095 --> 01:33:13,569
I'll give it to you.

1076
01:33:18,581 --> 01:33:19,619
Here.

1077
01:33:26,789 --> 01:33:28,427
Julia is in trouble!

1078
01:34:23,042 --> 01:34:24,713
I beg you.

1079
01:34:32,131 --> 01:34:33,769
Attempt to get out.

1080
01:34:45,423 --> 01:34:49,257
Running, Julia! Hurry up! Go!

1081
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:08,443
Listen, we need to disappear.
Here everywhere bulls will be equal.

1082
01:35:46,921 --> 01:35:48,396
Come here!

1083
01:35:59,413 --> 01:36:01,773
Let her go!
Hands on your head!

1084
01:36:02,216 --> 01:36:04,412
Stand up! Stand up!

1085
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,542
Police! Drop the gun!

1086
01:36:29,561 --> 01:36:31,464
-- Come on, on the floor!
-- On the floor!

1087
01:36:31,483 --> 01:36:33,466
-- Get down on the floor!
-- On the floor!

1088
01:36:33,486 --> 01:36:35,157
Do not move!

1089
01:36:39,692 --> 01:36:42,084
This afternoon were
the diamond robbers sentenced.

1090
01:36:42,334 --> 01:36:44,813

01:37:49,718 --> 01:37:52,755
-- So you look like a cop.
-- You got a problem with that?

1102
01:37:53,642 --> 01:37:54,800
What's up?

1103
01:37:55,643 --> 01:37:57,042
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

1104
01:37:57,365 --> 01:37:59,397
That's okay, Albert.
Tell me what's going on.

1105
01:37:59,647 --> 01:38:02,203

I have a coup.

1108
01:38:11,098 --> 01:38:13,054
-- You're kidding me.
-- A brilliant coup.

1109
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:14,779
But we need to do quickly.

1110
01:38:15,062 --> 01:38:17,498
Damn, Simon, I
soon have no more coal.

1111
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:18,806

bit celebrated too much, you know?

01:39:00,905 --> 01:39:03,488
I wanted to go to bathroom, open
the door bin, but ended up in the hallway.

And the door is easy
closed behind me.

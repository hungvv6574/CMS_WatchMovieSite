00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,800
l know all the blather
about the city being protected
by the curse of a mummy...

164
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,700
but my research
has led me to believe...

165
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,000
that the city itself
may have actually existed.

166
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,100
Are we talking about
the Hamunaptra?
that the city itself
may have actually existed.

167
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,000
Are we talking about
the Hamunaptra?

168
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,100
Yes. The City of the Dead.
Are we talking about

169
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,900
Yes. The City of the Dead.

170
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,000
Where the earliest pharaohs were said
to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
Yes. The City of the Dead.

171
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Where the earliest pharaohs were said
to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.

172
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Yes, yes, i-i-in a big,
underground treasure chamber.

173
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:42,800
- Heh!
- Oh, come on.
Everybody knows the story.
Yes, yes, i-i-in a big,
underground treasure chamber.

174
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,800
- Heh!
- Oh, come on.
Everybody knows the story.

175
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,200
The entire necropolis was rigged to sink
into the sand on Pharaoh's command.

176
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,300
The place would disappear beneath the
sand dunes, taking the treasure with it.
The entire necropolis was rigged to sink

177
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,900
The place would disappear beneath the
sand dunes, taking the treasure with it.

178
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,100
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum--
The place would disappear beneath the

179
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,200
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum--

180
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,600
Oh, my goodness!
Look at that!

181
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,000
You've burnt it! You've burned off
the part with the lost city.

182
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,900
lt's for the best,
l'm sure.

183
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,800
Many men
have wasted their lives...

184
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,100
in the foolish pursuit
of Hamunaptra.

185
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,600
No one's ever found it.

186
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,100
Most...
have never returned.

187
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,900
Come, come!
Step over the threshold.

188
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,300
Welcome to Cairo Prison,
my humble home.

189
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,100
You told me that you got it
on a dig down in Thebes.

190
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,200
- Well, l was mistaken.
- You lied.

192
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,500
l lie to everybody.
What makes you so special?

193
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,900
- l am your sister.
- That just makes you more gullible.

194
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,600
- You stole it from a drunk
at the local casbah.
- Picked his pocket, actually.

195
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:36,700
- So l don't think it's a very good--
- Stop being so ridiculous.

197
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,500

-What exactly is this man in prison for?
-This l do not know.

199
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,500
But when l heard that you were coming,
l asked him that myself.
-What exactly is this man in prison for?
-This l do not know.

200
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,400
But when l heard that you were coming,
l asked him that myself.

201
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,300
And what did he say?

202
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,500
He said he was just looking
for a good time.

203
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,400
-This is the man that you stole it from?
-Yes, exactly.

204
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,500
- So why don't we just go
sniff out a spot of tiffin--
- Who are you?
-This is the man that you stole it from?
-Yes, exactly.

205
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,600
- So why don't we just go
sniff out a spot of tiffin--
- Who are you?

206
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
- And who's the broad?
- ''Broad''?

207
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,200
l-l'm just a local sort of missionary
chap, spreading the good word.

208
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,700
- But this is my sister Evy.
- How do you do?

209
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:11,800
- Oh, well.
Guess she's not a total loss.
- l beg your pardon.
- But this is my sister Evy.
- How do you do?

211
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,800

Ask him about the box.

Uh, hello. Excuse me.

217
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,000
We both found
your puzzle box...

218
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,600
and we've come
to ask you about it.

219
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,500
- No.
- No.

220
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
No. You came to ask me
about Hamunaptra.

But how do we know

No, no. l've just got

230
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,400
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

231
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,600
Yeah, l was there.

232
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,700

234
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
Seti's place.
City of the Dead.

Could you tell me how to get there?

236
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,900

Do it, lady!

243
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,000
Where are they taking him?

244
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,900
To be hanged.

245
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
Apparently he had
a very good time.

246
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,700
l will give you 100 pounds
to save this man's life.

Any last requests, pig?

252
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Yeah. Loosen the knot
and let me go.

253
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Yahemar!
Of course we don't let him go!

254
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,900
Five hundred pounds!

255
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,400
And what else?

256
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
l'm a very lonely man.

257
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,400
- Yalla tlak!

258
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,500
Ha ha!
His neck did not break!

259
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,900
Oh, l'm so sorry. Now we must
watch him strangle to death.

260
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,900
He knows the location
to Hamunaptra.

261
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,000
- You lie.
- l would never!

262
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,500
Are you telling me this filthy,
godless son of a pig knows where

263
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:53,600
- Yes!
- Truly?

Ahh! Cut him down!

271
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,700

288
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,000
Can you look me in the eye and guarantee
me this isn't some kind of a flimflam?

289

Lady, let me put it this way:
My whole damn garrison

- Because if it is, l am warning you--
- You're warning me?

292
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,600
Lady, let me put it this way:
My whole damn garrison
believed in this so much...

293
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,200
that without orders,
they marched halfway across Libya
and into Egypt to find that city.

294
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,400
When we got there,
all we found...
that without orders,
they marched halfway across Libya
and into Egypt to find that city.

295
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,500
When we got there,
all we found...

296
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,700
was sand and blood.

297
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,800
Let me get your bags.

298
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,700
Yes, yes, you're right.

299
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,300
Filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.
Nothing to like there at all.

300
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,300
Bright good morning to all.

301
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh, no.
What are you doing here?

302
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,000
l'm here to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

303
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,400
Quit playin' with
your glasses and cut the deck, Burns.

304
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,300
Without my glasses
l can't see the deck to cut it, Dave.

305
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,000
O'Connell, sit down.
We could use another player.

306
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,100
- l only gamble with
my life, never my money.
- Never?
O'Connell, sit down.
We could use another player.

308
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,600
What if l was to bet you $500

309
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,300
- You're looking for Hamunaptra?
- Damn straight we are.

310

Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare ya.

327
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,500
The only thing that scares me,
Mr. O'Connell, are your manners.

328
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Still angry about that kiss, huh?

329
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,200
Well, if you call that a kiss.

Something underneath that sand.

if you help us win that bet.

469
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,800
Oh, my pleasure.

470
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:52,900
Hey, O'Connell.
Oh, my pleasure.

471
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,700
Hey, O'Connell.

472
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,300
Nice camel.

473
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
Get ready for it.

474
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,700
For what?

475
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,600
We're about to be shown the way.

476
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,200
Will ya look at that.

477
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,000
Can you believe it?

478
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,100
Hamunaptra.
Can you believe it?

479
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,600
Hamunaptra.

480
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,200
Here we go again.

481
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,000
Oww!

482
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,700
So long, Beni!

483
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,300
That serves you right.

484
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,400
Whoo!

485
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,500
Whoo-hoo!
Go, Evy! Go!
Whoo!

486
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,400
Whoo-hoo!
Go, Evy! Go!

487
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,400
Whoo!

488
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Whoo-hoo!

489
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Do they know somethin'
we don't?

490
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,500
They are led by a woman.

491
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:16,600
What does a woman know?
They are led by a woman.

492
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,700
What does a woman know?

493
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:18,800
That's a statue of Anubis.
What does a woman know?

494
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,600

According to Bembridge scholars,
that's where we'll find
a secret compartment...
lts legs go deep underground.

498
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,100
According to Bembridge scholars,
that's where we'll find
a secret compartment...

499
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,300
containing the golden
Book of Amun-Ra.

500
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,900
Jonathan, you're meant
to catch the sun with that.

501
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,600
So, uh, what are
these old mirrors for?

502
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,400
Ancient mirrors. lt's an ancient
Egyptian trick. You'll see.

503
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Uh, here, this is for, uh, you.

504
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,300
Go ahead. lt's something
l borrowed off our American brethren.

505
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,200
l thought you might like it--

506
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,200
you might need it
for when you're, uh-- uh, yeah.

507
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,300
What are you lookin' at?
you might need it
for when you're, uh-- uh, yeah.

508
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,400
What are you lookin' at?

509
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,600
Hey! Look for bugs.

510
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,500
l hate bugs.

511
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,300
We're standing inside a room
no one has entered in over 3,000 years.

512
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,500
Whoo! What is
that god-awful stench?
We're standing inside a room

513
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,000
Whoo! What is
that god-awful stench?

514
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,800
And then there was...

515
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,700
light.

516
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,100
Hey, that is a neat trick.

517
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,600
- Oh, my God. lt's a sah-netjer.
- Huh?

518
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:37,700
- A preparation room.
- Preparation for what?
- Oh, my God. lt's a sah-netjer.
- Huh?

519
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,700
- A preparation room.
- Preparation for what?

520
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,900
For entering the afterlife.

521
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,000
Mummies, my good son.
This is where they made the mummies.
For entering the afterlife.

Mummies, my good son.
This is where they made the mummies.

523
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,300
What the--

524
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,000
What was that?

525
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,100
Sounds like... bugs.
What was that?

526
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,700
Sounds like... bugs.

527
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,600
He said bugs.

528
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,900
What do you mean, bugs?
l hate bugs.

529
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,000
The legs of Anubis.

530
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,100
The secret compartment
should be hidden somewhere inside here.
The legs of Anubis.

531
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,000
The secret compartment

532
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,400
You scared the bejesus
out of us, O'Connell.

533
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,200
Likewise.

534
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,400
- Hey, that's my tool kit.
- l don't think so.

535
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
Okay.

536
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,900
Perhaps l was mistaken.

537
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,000
Have a nice day, gentlemen. We have
a lot of work to be getting along with.
Perhaps l was mistaken.

a lot of work to be getting along with.

539
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,000
- Push off! This is our dig site.
- We got here first.

540
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,100
This here's our statue, friend.

O'Connell.

550
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,100
Oh, look, for goodness' sake,
let's be nice, children.

551
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,700
lf we're going to play together,
we must learn to share.

552
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,800
There are other places to dig.

553
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,500
According to these hieroglyphics...

554
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,400
we're underneath the statue.

555
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,600
We should come up
right between his legs.

556
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,800
- When those damn Yanks
go to sleep-- No offense--
- None taken.

557

right out from under them.

Where'd our smelly
little friend get to?

566
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,900
Hey.

567
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
What have we here?

568
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,000
Blue gold.

569
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,600
This will fetch
a mighty fine price.

570
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,800
- Let's get us some treasure!
- Careful!

571
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,400
Seti was no fool.

572
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:00,500

00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,600
Yeah, sure.
Let them open it.

577
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,600
Zee-eda.

578
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,700
Let me get this straight.

579
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,300
They ripped out your guts
and stuffed them in jars.

580
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,800
They'd take out your heart as well.
You know how they took out your brains?

581
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:39,900
l don't think we need
to know this.

00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,600
They'd take a sharp, red-hot poker,
stick it up your nose...

584
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:44,700
scramble things about a bit and then
rip it all out through your nostrils.

That's gotta hurt.

587
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,700
lt's called mummification.
You'll be dead when they do this.

lt's a sarcophagus.

594
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,900
Buried at the base of Anubis.

595
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,400
He must have been someone
of great importance.

596
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:20,500
Or he did something very naughty.

One more.

600
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,200
One more.

601
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,700
Help me! Help me!

602
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,500
Well, who is it?

603
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,600
''He That Shall Not Be Named.''

604
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,600
This looks like
some sort of a lock.

605
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,800
- Well, whoever's in here
sure wasn't getting out.
- Yeah, no kidding.

606
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:29,900
lt'd take us a month
to crack into this thing without a key.
- Well, whoever's in here

A key! A key!
That's what he was talking about!
A key?

610
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,000
A key! A key!
That's what he was talking about!

611
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,100
- Who?
- The man on the barge.
A key! A key!
That's what he was talking about!

612

613
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,800
The one with the hook.
He was looking for a key.

614
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
Hey, that's mine.

615
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,500
- What do you suppose killed him?
- Did you ever see him eat?

616
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:11,700
Seems that our American friends had
a little misfortune of their own today.

618
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,900
Three of their diggers

00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,000
- What?
- How?
Three of their diggers
were, uh... melted.

620

- How?

621
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,700
Salt acid.
Pressurized salt acid.

622
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,700
Some kind of
ancient booby trap.

623
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:27,900
Maybe this place really is cursed.

Oh, for goodness' sake, you two!

626

- You don't believe in curses?
- No, l don't.

627
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,200

and l can touch it, it's real.

My God, what is it?

632
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,200
A broken bottle.

633
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,900
Glenlivet. Twelve years old!

- No, wait, wait! Wait for me. Wait!
- Evy!

638
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,100
Excuse me, but didn't the man

01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,700

We all got our little
problems today, Winston.

948
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,800
l just wish l could have
chucked it in with the others...

949
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:42,900
and gone down
in flame and glory...

951
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,900
instead of sitting
around here...

952
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,000
rotting of boredom and booze.

953
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,600
Cheers. Mmm.

954
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:56,800
Mmm. Oh, well, back to the airfield.

- Oh, yes, always.

957
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,600
We're all packed up, but the damn boat
doesn't leave till tomorrow morning.

958
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,100
Tail set firmly
between your legs, l see.

959
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:08,300
You can talk. You don't have
some sacred walkin' corpse after ya.

960
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,000
So, uh, how's your friend?

961
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,200
He had his eyes and his tongue
ripped out. How would you be?

to meet you.

966
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,100
Prince lmhotep

Please forgive me.

970
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,300
Oh-ho. Whoops.

971
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:34,400
Mr. Burns...
Oh-ho. Whoops.

972
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,200

- But l am afraid more is needed.
- Wha--

979
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,000
The prince must finish the job...

980
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,600
and consummate the curse
which you and your friends...

981
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:56,700
- have brought down upon yourselves.
- Wait! No!
and consummate the curse

983

Good luck, boys.

984
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:13,200
Sweet Jesus!
Tasted just like--

985
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:13,300
Blood.
Sweet Jesus!
Tasted just like--

986
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,500
Blood.

987

''And the rivers and waters
of Egypt ran red...

He's here.

991
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,900
Oh, looks like
there's gonna be a storm.

992
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,000

Hey!

996
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,000
Beni, you little stinkweed.
Where you been?

997
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,600
We are in serious trouble.

998
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,200
We are in very serious trouble.

999
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,100
He does seem to like Evy.

1000
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,000
Yeah, what's that about?

1001
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
- What's this guy want?
- There's only one person
that can give us any answers.

1002
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:16,100
- You!
- Miss Carnahan.

After what l just saw...

1008
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:26,800
l'm willing to go
on a little faith here.

1010
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,200
We are part of
an ancient secret society.

1011
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,500
For over 3,000 years
we have guarded the City of the Dead.

1012

We are sworn at manhood
to do any and all in our power
to stop the High Priest lmhotep...

1014
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,800
- from being reborn into this world.
- Because of you, we have failed.

1015
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:43,000
You think this justifies
the killing of innocent people?

You think this justifies

1017
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,700
- To stop this creature?
Let me think. Yes!
- Yes!

1018
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,900
Question:
Why doesn't he like cats?

1019
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:56,600
Cats are the guardians of the
underworld. He will fear them
until he is fully regenerated.

1020
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:56,700
- Then he will fear nothing.
- You know how he gets hisself
fully regenerated?

1022
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,600

who opened that chest.
- And suckin' 'em dry!

1023
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:03,700
Jonathan, will you stop
playing with that?

Jonathan, will you stop

1025
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:10,600
When l saw him alive at Hamunaptra,
he called me Anck-su-namun.

1026
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,600
And then just now in Mr. Burns'
quarters, h-he tried to kiss me.

1027
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:15,800
lt's because of his love
for Anck-su-namun that he was cursed.

1029
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,400
- Apparently, even after 3,000 years--
- He is still in love with her.

1030
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:21,500
Yes, that is very romantic,
but what has it got to do with me?

Yes, that is very romantic,
but what has it got to do with me?

1032
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:24,500
Perhaps he will once again
try to raise her from the dead.

1034
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,500
And it appears he has already chosen
his human sacrifice.

1035
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,100
Bad luck, old mum.

1036
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,300
On the contrary, it may
just give us the time we need...

his hand towards the heavens...

01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:11,000
We must find the Egyptologist and bring
him back to the safety of the fort...

- Let's go, Jonathan.

1068

Oh, l thought l could just stay
at the fort and, uh, reconnoiter.

1069
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:54,400
- Now!
- Yeah, right. We're just
gonna rescue the Egyptologist.

Well, well, well.
Let me guess. Spring cleaning.

Let me help you up.

What friend?
You are my only friend.

1075

Something about bringing
his dead girlfriend back to life.

1090
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,700
But that's all.
He just wants the book, l swear.

1091
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,700
Just the book, l swear.
And your sister.

1092
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:31,800
But other than that--
Just the book, l swear.
And your sister.

1093
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,700
But other than that--

1094
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,600
That's two down,
two to go.

1095
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,800
Then he'll be coming after Evy.

1096
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:25,900
Guards in place!
Reporting all clear, sir!
Then he'll be coming after Evy.

1097
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:29,000
Guards in place!
Reporting all clear, sir!

1098
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,900
To hell with this.

1099
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,200
l'm goin' downstairs, get me a drink.
You want somethin'?

1100
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,700
- Yeah. Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon.
- All right.

1101
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,100
- A-And a shot of bourbon.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

1102
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:38,200
- And a bourbon chaser.

01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:40,700
Don't worry about the door.
- And a bourbon chaser.
- l'll get your damn bourbon!

1105
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,100
Don't worry about the door.

1106
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,700
Anck-su-namun.

1107
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,700
Hey, get your ugly face off of her!

1108
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,100
Look what l got.

1109
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,400
- You all right?
- Well, l'm not sure.

1110
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,800
Well, according to legend,
the black book the Americans
found at Hamunaptra...

1111
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:11,900
is supposed to bring people
back from the dead.
Well, according to legend,

1112
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,900
is supposed to bring people
back from the dead.

1113
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,500
- Until now it was a notion
l was unwilling to believe.
- Believe it, sister.

1114
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:16,600
That's what brought
our buddy back to life.
- Until now it was a notion
l was unwilling to believe.
- Believe it, sister.

1115
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,500
That's what brought
our buddy back to life.

1116
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,700
l'm thinking that if the black book
can bring dead people to life--

1117
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:21,800
- Then maybe the gold book can kill him.
- That's the myth.

1119
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,800
Now we just have to find out
where the gold book is hidden.

1120
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:29,000
lmhotep. lmhotep.
Now we just have to find out
where the gold book is hidden.

1121
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,900
lmhotep. lmhotep.

1122
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,600
Last but not least...

1123
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,400
my favorite plague--
boils and sores.

1124
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,800
They have become his slaves.

1125
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:01,000
So it has begun,
the beginning of the end.

1126
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Not quite yet, it hasn't.
Come on.

1127
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,200
lmhotep. lmhotep.
Not quite yet, it hasn't.
Come on.

1128
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:08,500
lmhotep. lmhotep.

1129
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:28,000
According to Bembridge scholars,
the golden Book of Amun-Ra...

1130
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,100
is located inside
the statue of Anubis.
According to Bembridge scholars,
the golden Book of Amun-Ra...

1131
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,200
is located inside
the statue of Anubis.

1132
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,300
- That's where we found the black book.
- Exactly.

1133
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,700
- Looks like the old boys
at Bembridge were mistaken.
- They mixed the books up.

1134
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:35,800
Mixed up where
they were buried.

Mixed up where

1136
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:37,700
So if the black book
is inside the statue of Anubis...
Mixed up where
they were buried.

1137
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,600
So if the black book
is inside the statue of Anubis...

1138
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,200
then the golden book
must be inside--

1139
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,300
- Come on, Evy. Faster.
- Patience is a virtue.

1140
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,400
Not right now it isn't.

1141
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,900
Uh, l think l'll go
and get the car started.

1142
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:01,700
l've got it. The golden
Book of Amun-Ra is at Hamunaptra
inside the statue of Horus.

1143
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:01,800
Take that, Bembridge scholars.

Everybody else we've bumped into

Take them from the top, otherwise
the whole thing will cave in on us.

1246
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:44,700
Come on.
Put your backs into it.

1247
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:49,200

There he is!

1270
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:29,500
Hello, Horus, old boy.

Open the book, Jonathan.
lt's the only way to kill him.

1287
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:52,600
You have to open the book
and find the inscription.
Open the book, Jonathan.
lt's the only way to kill him.

1288
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:55,500
You have to open the book

Here's an inscription.

''Rasheem-- Rasheem oola--

1299
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,200
Oh, boy.

01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:59,700
- You can command them.

1306
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,800
Finish the inscription
on the cover, idiot.

1307

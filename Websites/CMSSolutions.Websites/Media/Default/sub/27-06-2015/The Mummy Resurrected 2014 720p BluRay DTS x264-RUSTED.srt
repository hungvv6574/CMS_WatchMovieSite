00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,849
- Maggie.
- Hello.

3
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,064
I need you inside,
Geri did a version...

4
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,507
Hieroglifica the "Pictionaria".

5
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,312
Can you believe it?
Did he really come?

6
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,422
Santa arrives at the hotel tonight at 18:30

7
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:33,288
Do you think a vigil
outside is a good idea?

8
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:34,665
Am I being childish?

9
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,713
Considering how they should be here...

10
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:38,335
Been waiting for two days.

11
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,503
I know, I should not be so excited, but...

12
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,290
- I can not contain myself.
- I can not contain myself.

13
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:45,611
You know,
plus occasional photos...

14
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,993
You have not seen... or heard of it...

15
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:50,712
In almost 20 years.

16
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:53,338
I just want you to control
their expectations, that's all.

17
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:55,868
If this does not correspond to the same...

18
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:58,340
- ... Enthusiasm.
- Of course.

19
00:05:58,452 --> 00:05:59,719
It's my father.

20
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:01,020
I hope so.

21
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:03,744
You can not know for sure how someone is.

22
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:06,035
I think so.

23
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,578
And how do you know?

24
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:09,383
I can feel it.

25
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:11,164
Always have these feelings?

26
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,890
Yes, I know of no person
in their right mind would do that.

27
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:19,228
We should not enter?

28
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,797
She tried, I'll wait out here.

29
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:25,701
And you will lose all the drama
Geri game invented?

30
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,179
Hey!
They will not come?

31
00:06:28,214 --> 00:06:30,236
I spent all night doing this thing.

32
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:31,983
His father will finally arrive.

33
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,725
- Seriously, is it?
- Yes

34
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,432
- Now?
- Girls.

35
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:36,718
Let's go.

36
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:38,803
- I know.
- You can enter?

37
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:42,171
- Please?
- Okay, and you listened.

38
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:43,609
At long departure.

39
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,345
Okay, listen.
The party is over.

40
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:55,894
Girl, look at you.

41
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:59,195
What a beautiful woman you've become!

42
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:03,295
- Hello.
- Come here and give your old man a hug.

43
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,066
You look like your mother.

44
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:16,171
I loved her more than his own life.

45
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,257
Which means...

46
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:21,183
I'll love you even more.

47
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:25,547
I see you brought the whole
class of "moral support".

48
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:28,015
Mr. Tralane, nice to meet you finally.

49
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,674
I've heard a lot about you.

50
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:31,016
Of course.

51
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:33,601
You can not leave a mark that lasts.

52
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:36,052
If you always walk on tiptoes.

53
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,897
Father, this is Veronica Korvac.

54
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:43,297
Yes, I am eternally grateful.

55
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,967
You know, I do not think it would been able
to bring my daughter here without you.

56
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,630
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, too.

57
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:54,138
I am a big fan.

58
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,073
Ever since.

59
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:59,050
Looks like I have some of those days.

60
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,227
'm Geri... Grant.

61
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:04,176
Yes, of course you're the...

62
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,048
The girl who found the last two
burial sites.

63
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:10,286
- That's right.
- Well, I must say I'm a fan of yours.

64
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,348
Very well, dear.

65
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:13,671
Well done.

66
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,352
Last but not least...

67
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:16,856
Sara Winchester.

68
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:18,325
Kelly Kennedy.

69
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:19,858
Kennedy.

70
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:23,179
Look at you.

71
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:24,581
It's so refreshing.

72
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:26,609
It is so refreshing to work again with...

73
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:28,603
Spirits so young and full of energy.

74
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:31,610
Now who wants to come with me for a drink?

75
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,182
You must have had a very long journey,
surely you are tired.

76
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:38,877
It does not matter.

77
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:41,078
Okay, how about...

78
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,325
The update.
Long ago.

79
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,819
Well, this is your room.

80
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:49,725
See you in the morning.

81
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:04,467
Before you go,
I have something for you.

82
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,588
Not the original.

83
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:13,514
He has been missing for decades.

84
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:18,183
But it is an excellent copy,
1 of 2 replicas in your hand.

85
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:20,183
Where did you get that?

86
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:22,264
I've been in many places.

87
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,757
I managed with some Armenian friends.

88
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,620
It was expensive, but worth it.

89
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,404
Cartography is amazing.

90
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:31,722
Looks like we're in the same place.

91
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:33,307
I think you get the idea.

92
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:37,136
But I really need that Miss
Winchester and you translate the terms.

93
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:39,367
Unless you can.

94
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:45,103
No, you stay with it for now.

95
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:48,034
I hope you do not try to bribe me.

96
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,077
Maggie.

97
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,505
I know I have not done
a good job for you.

98
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,011
And I'm sorry.

99
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,920
But although it sounds cliché.

100
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,415
I had my reasons.

101
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,900
Let's go.

102
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,381
I forgot.

103
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,353
We're together now.

104
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,895
As I hope will be for a long time.

105
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,032
If you depend on me, baby.

106
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:13,997
Will be forever.

107
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,909
'm Madu, his connection with the SCA.

108
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:32,077
Sorry for the intrusion.

109
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:34,755
But I can not take them
to the region tomorrow.

110
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:36,881
And, for your own safety...

111
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:39,250
I revoke your permission.

112
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,024
There is evil in the Valley.

113
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:43,902
A great, great evil.

114
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:46,597
He swore that all who come to the Valley.

115
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:48,328
Raiders of the unspeakable.

116
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:50,024
"never come back".

117
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,017
Sorcerer Valley.

118
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:08,341
Now I see why your guides
government does not want to go.

119
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,753
But you will. Right?

120
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:14,096
You are not afraid of old superstitions.

121
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:18,594
Border guards in Libya are not a myth.

122
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,664
They make many excursions along the border.

123
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:23,673
More than anything at night but...

124
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,509
At times during the day.

125
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:28,196
Looking for prey.

126
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:30,306
As you and your group.

127
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,611
In this case, we are not just guides.

128
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,473
We are also...

129
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,549
Protection.

130
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,851
I need more money.

131
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:45,027
And early

132
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:47,278
$ 700.

133
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,654
Not a penny more,
half now, half in return.

134
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:58,136
And where do we take it?

135
00:15:58,146 --> 00:16:02,373
I'm sure there will be many
who would like to earn $ 700.

136
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:19,553
I think the term is...
"We have an agreement."

137
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,300
Come on everybody time to load things.

138
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,558
What?

139
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,960
Mr. Madu retired.

140
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:54,042
So we had to find an alternative.

141
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:55,944
They are able to get a license?

142
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:57,663
We do not need one now.

143
00:16:57,698 --> 00:16:59,398
My father and I will
take care of that later.

144
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:02,326
Do not tell me that you took the
Kool-Aid after a day.

145
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:04,292
It does not form part of the same...

146
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,184
Archaeological excavation in this country.

147
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:08,020
Much less carry one.

148
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:09,776
He leads, I do.

149
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:12,037
Then act in the rules, so you do not...

150
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,264
Ruin his career before it began.

151
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:16,348
Come on, we'll be fine.

152
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:19,138
They are very strict about
excavations in this country.

153
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,466
You know, Tralane know.

154
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:22,901
I know what, honey?

155
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,976
You need a license.

156
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,525
No, if you will only find the tomb.

157
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,249
We'll be fine,
while we do not change anything there.

158
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,584
Right? We can not miss the day ..

159
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:46,028
I do not know, it sounded version
archeology of "just the tip".

160
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:48,968
And we all know how
you enjoy playing it.

161
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,003
Sorry Teacher.

162
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,483
- Yes?
- I've seen it.

163
00:17:57,518 --> 00:18:00,931
And it seems that a part of it, is lost.

164
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:02,654
- Seriously?
- Yes

165
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:05,480
All pages after
Van Heim reach the tomb.

166
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,949
It is as if they had been removed.

167
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:16,049
You're right.

168
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,082
It seems my Armenian friends were mild.

169
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:23,590
They sold me damaged goods bastards.

170
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,392
Now what?

171
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:29,370
The story is there for us to write.

172
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,386
Made all the lists?

173
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,231
I think we should leave the team.

174
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:05,842
Not even enter the tomb.

175
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:08,050
Just make sure to fill your water bottle.

176
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,701
We need to stay hydrated here.

177
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:11,367
- Well, come on.
- Okay.

178
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:31,299
What was that?

179
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:33,157
Nothing my dear, nothing.

180
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:35,791
Just go walking.

181
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:37,756
Come on, now, now.

182
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:51,702
We should...

183
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:03,661
So what was this great evil...

184
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:05,852
Mr. Madu was so afraid?

185
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,919
Nothing.

186
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:10,220
Just nonsense.

187
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,815
They helped create the
mystery that is Egypt.

188
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,593
Seemed very convincing.

189
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:23,799
Surely you have the
determination to Tralane.

190
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,872
In the old days there was a...

191
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,069
Great Wizard.

192
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:32,807
A king or queen...

193
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,909
That... was erased from history forever.

194
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:40,743
A great, great sorcerer.

195
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:43,955
He had no name, no name.

196
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:48,154
And who said that his name
could disappear from life.

197
00:20:48,968 --> 00:20:52,990
Something worse than death, nothing.

198
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:55,791
To resurface again in the other world.

199
00:20:56,476 --> 00:20:58,890
And that is what we seek?

200
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:02,165
That, dear,
is what you will find.

201
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:08,132
Let's go?

202
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,011
Hey, here.

203
00:21:40,046 --> 00:21:43,202
You see the hieroglyphics destroyed
at the entrance of the tomb?

204
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:46,769
Was to confuse the messengers of Anubis.

205
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:51,877
Come on, come on.

206
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:29,671
Here it is.

207
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:36,616
I can not believe he's here.

208
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:39,249
What does this mean in
the old Van Heim now?

209
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,952
Hey, wait a second.

210
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:45,145
And if we return to the village
to see if you get a license?

211
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,323
- Now?
- I do not want to miss this discovery.

212
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:49,905
By a simple procedure.

213
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,737
I said I would not enter the tomb...

214
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:53,534
here is allowed.

215
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:54,710
And I meant it.

216
00:22:54,745 --> 00:22:56,364
I'm the boss, remember?

217
00:22:56,746 --> 00:22:58,535
Yes, sorry boss.

218
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:07,734
What are they doing,
is not yet time to go...

219
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,268
Has sun for hours.

220
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:10,704
Insurance is nothing.

221
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,812
You continue to work and I did.

222
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:17,631
Something wrong?

223
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,066
It seems that something is wrong.

224
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:21,885
- All is well.
- It looks very ugly.

225
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,886
Let's take a look.

226
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,918
It's not safe here now.

227
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:29,828
Do not waste my time.

228
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:31,360
Right?

229
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,315
I see nothing.

230
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,265
Probably, just want to take
the money from his father.

231
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,066
They do it all the time.

232
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,109
What is this cloud of dust?

233
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,105
Seems chenado close.

234
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:46,823
Cloud of dust?

235
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,652
- Seriously?
- Whatever.

236
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:50,446
Surely will only follow your path.

237
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,094
We are here at the top, right?

238
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:55,716
Come on, do not we have more
important things to do?

239
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:57,350
Yes, we have.

240
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,417
Come on, we'll be fine.

241
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:01,994
My dad will not let anything
bad happen to us.

242
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,637
Libyan guards are here.

243
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:05,830
Shut up, we're here.

244
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:15,030
They are here now.

245
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:17,248
Take care of them.

246
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:19,106
Come see, come.

247
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:54,944
I thought you translated this.

248
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,077
Well, all arranged.

249
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:01,378
See, false alarm.

250
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:03,147
Okay?

251
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:06,259
Yes, of course.

252
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:10,315
They wanted to talk about charges
additional and extra work hours.

253
00:25:10,363 --> 00:25:12,145
More importantly, what happens here?

254
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,932
At this time, nothing.

255
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:16,191
Looks like someone is a little rusty.

256
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,371
I think it should be on a wall.

257
00:25:18,406 --> 00:25:21,463
Yes, it was all too good to be true, right?

258
00:25:21,498 --> 00:25:24,521
Things are a bit cryptic at the moment.

259
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,177
After researching.

260
00:25:26,212 --> 00:25:29,963
I discovered that the key
is in building the car.

261
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:32,500
Although it is not imaginary.

262
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:35,016
Then, the letters "AMAMPMD".

263
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:37,452
- So the word "bear".
- Bear.

264
00:25:37,487 --> 00:25:39,766
It is written in the
margin on the car floor.

265
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:41,189
Set the car.

266
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:43,002
The assembly in the car.

267
00:25:43,037 --> 00:25:44,678
Or inside the bear.

268
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:47,529
Yes...

269
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:50,332
They are colloquial 17th century.

270
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:52,478
Track or any other words of wisdom?

271
00:25:52,513 --> 00:25:53,983
That's it.

272
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:56,770
He wrote that when he opened the tomb...

273
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,292
The sun had set,
with his guards left.

274
00:25:59,327 --> 00:26:00,435
Then there are a couple of pages...

275
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,879
Was so excited, I could not sleep.

276
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:05,289
He was vigilant in heaven
that guided me.

277
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:07,433
But nothing more.

278
00:26:08,382 --> 00:26:10,273
Set the car.

279
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:13,235
- Or Bear?
- Perhaps talked about...

280
00:26:13,753 --> 00:26:15,474
constellations

281
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:18,867
The car, you know, part of Ursa Major.

282
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:20,544
The Bear.

283
00:26:22,827 --> 00:26:24,540
In their language, the car...

284
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:26,254
It is known as the "plow."

285
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,249
The cart.

286
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:30,823
That seems like a constellation.

287
00:26:30,902 --> 00:26:33,454
The Egyptians called the eternal rocks.

288
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:37,432
They feared that the constellation
disappeared in the night sky.

289
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,322
And that symbolized eternity.

290
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:44,239
And these letters, "AMAMPMD".

291
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:47,367
Supports for the first seven stars.

292
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:50,177
The key is the order of star formation.

293
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:07,030
What the hell was that?

294
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,740
Seemed fireworks.

295
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:10,238
Seemed more shots.

296
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:37,089
I think our guys are under attack.

297
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:38,834
- Who attacked?
- I dont know.

298
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,328
I dont know.

299
00:29:21,285 --> 00:29:23,005
Oh. Shit.

300
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:27,278
- They are coming, they were killed.
- What?

301
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:29,841
- Who comes?
- I have no idea.

302
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:32,108
- Who comes?
- Fuck that.

303
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:33,695
I'm here!

304
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,107
- What if you were arrested?
- You know, I could not tell you.

305
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:40,108
Come on, God!

306
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:51,932
A small detail, so...

307
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:53,145
How close the door?

308
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,425
Even though we did not discuss the matter.

309
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,898
- Get in there.
- Okay.

310
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:24,219
Now what?

311
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:26,761
Only hope.

312
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,426
While they can not enter,
we'll be fine.

313
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,499
I want to make a practical question.

314
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,763
What happens when you do not
get to the hotel tonight?

315
00:30:34,815 --> 00:30:36,625
Not sent someone?

316
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,436
There was an official guide.

317
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,405
Nobody knows we're here.

318
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:43,141
Do not worry dear.

319
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,022
We'll be fine.

320
00:30:45,057 --> 00:30:47,910
I was in a situation
There are similarly many years.

321
00:30:47,945 --> 00:30:50,107
And emerges victorious.

322
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:51,796
Was in Sudan.

323
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:53,621
I was stuck for days.

324
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:58,018
Hey.

325
00:30:58,103 --> 00:30:59,686
Okay?

326
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:05,443
I take that as a "yes"?

327
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:07,887
Maggie did not want to tell you...
"I told you."

328
00:31:07,922 --> 00:31:09,278
So do not tell

329
00:31:09,313 --> 00:31:11,671
Well, it's just a setback.

330
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:13,882
A setback is...

331
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:17,208
Waking up with a hangover,
20 minutes before a test.

332
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,472
This is crazy.

333
00:31:19,956 --> 00:31:21,423
It's an adventure.

334
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,767
Imagine what this will be for
forever in our memories.

335
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:26,077
If you survive the time
enough to write.

336
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,772
Clueless, come on, we'll be fine.

337
00:31:28,807 --> 00:31:30,574
I will, I promise.

338
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:32,080
Trust me.

339
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,787
Maggie, I trust in you.

340
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:39,591
He would not let anything bad
happen to us.

341
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:41,849
He would not, I know.

342
00:31:41,884 --> 00:31:43,593
- I'm your daughter.
- Hey.

343
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:46,130
Best to come here.

344
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:51,164
Gone?

345
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:53,349
- How is he going to do?
- Look at that.

346
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:56,644
Went there without saying anything?

347
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:58,373
Should have prevented?

348
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:01,383
At a time when his father
was talking about...

349
00:32:01,418 --> 00:32:03,115
Being stuck in a tomb.

350
00:32:03,194 --> 00:32:05,525
And found a back door to exit.

351
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,361
And then he started talking
with Winchester in German.

352
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:10,381
Two seconds later.

353
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:12,484
This.

354
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:14,335
This guy is a gem.

355
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,264
He passed expeditions before we were born.

356
00:32:17,473 --> 00:32:19,387
I'm sure he knows what he does.

357
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:21,174
I am afraid.

358
00:32:21,209 --> 00:32:22,850
This is a way out then?

359
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:24,492
If so, he would have gone.

360
00:32:24,912 --> 00:32:27,641
Probably just takes you to one
deepest place of the tomb.

361
00:32:27,676 --> 00:32:29,086
Winchester.

362
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,496
Teacher.

363
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,941
We must go after them.

364
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,013
Yes... you are the daughter of his father.

365
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,554
I'll go with you.

366
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,882
Geri. Maybe better
if you stay here.

367
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:44,100
I've been on other expeditions,
you know.

368
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:46,048
I have a good idea what to do.

369
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,530
I'm sure, but...

370
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,381
We need someone to stay here.

371
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:50,599
With them.

372
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:52,527
More memories, right?

373
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,333
Winchester.

374
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:00,858
Teacher.

375
00:33:01,977 --> 00:33:03,893
They must be joking.

376
00:33:04,014 --> 00:33:06,127
They could disappear into thin air.

377
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:07,734
What's down there?

378
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:11,707
A narrow corridor.

379
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:15,042
Like your father did to pass around?

380
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,750
He knows how to pass through
of a tight spot.

381
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:20,411
It is determined, yes I admit.

382
00:33:20,528 --> 00:33:22,044
That's it.

383
00:33:22,062 --> 00:33:23,544
Let's go?

384
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,331
Hear that?

385
00:33:44,615 --> 00:33:47,009
- What?
- It sounded like a growl.

386
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,107
- As a lion.
- Please.

387
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,452
Simply.

388
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,066
They were a long time already?

389
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:54,489
I have no idea.

390
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:57,001
They should not mind
I need something

391
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,611
To calm myself.

392
00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:00,695
Where did you get the grass?

393
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,718
- In hotel.
- You can not smoke it here.

394
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:04,798
Sure, I have a recipe.

395
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,781
That means nothing in Egypt.

396
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:09,333
When you're in jail,
teach your recipe.

397
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:13,864
Do not worry,
I'll finish before returning.

398
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,095
Or you wanted some?

399
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:21,012
You?

400
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:23,258
She is already a paranoid hypochondriac.

401
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:24,881
Want to do worse?

402
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:26,890
- I'm not paranoid.
- No?

403
00:34:26,925 --> 00:34:28,820
Just heard a growl.

404
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:30,455
Was right about the dust cloud.

405
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,611
Look, if I had listened,
we would not be stuck here.

406
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:37,849
Are you sure?
Can calm your nerves.

407
00:34:38,428 --> 00:34:40,480
- No thanks.
- What a shame.

408
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:43,019
Works great for me.

409
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:46,480
As if you had any
reason to be nervous.

410
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:49,625
Hey, I do not have to
justify myself to you.

411
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:54,061
I had things that no girl should have.

412
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:57,198
Things to fuck your life.

413
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,473
June 14, 1995.

414
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:02,099
I will never forget.

415
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:04,297
Attacked a hospital in Chernobyl.

416
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:05,905
I was with my mother.

417
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:08,174
She was executed in front of me.

418
00:35:08,457 --> 00:35:09,889
For the next two days.

419
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:12,837
I was locked in a room
with dead and dying.

420
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:15,686
I do not feel good inside.

421
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:17,795
This.

422
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,346
It helps me deal with it.

423
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:27,404
What?

424
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,672
Try a little?

425
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:30,502
Believe me, a little bit and...

426
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:32,297
I left completely relaxed.

427
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:35,031
Will help you forget all those sounds.

428
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:43,552
Let's go.

429
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:46,914
A city girl like you
never traveled before?

430
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:54,951
Father, my God.

431
00:35:54,996 --> 00:35:56,598
I was very scared.

432
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:59,043
It is quiet, there is no
reason to be alarmed.

433
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:00,434
- We are well.
- What were they thinking?

434
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:02,641
I can not believe
you just go out like that.

435
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,828
We have enough problems?

436
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,137
Not a bit, dear.

437
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:09,053
We track the most fantastic discovery.

438
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,525
Let's go.

439
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,761
Look, Maggie.

440
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,734
Anankatep.

441
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:19,033
True High Priest and Guardian...

442
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:21,473
Unnamed.

443
00:36:21,886 --> 00:36:23,573
Actually, I think.

444
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:24,922
Yes.

445
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:27,407
And the answer must be the secret here.

446
00:36:28,794 --> 00:36:30,981
- This is amazing.
- Yes

447
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:55,565
Oh, my God.

448
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,321
Hello?

449
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:28,433
Hello?

450
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:38,441
Through the mutilation of
the body is secured...

451
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:41,007
As not to arouse the spirit world.

452
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:46,216
The remote location is to
prevent messengers from beyond.

453
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,183
According to legend, the
anonymous had no intention...

454
00:37:49,218 --> 00:37:51,364
Go to the Kingdom of the Dead.

455
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:54,111
Instead, the wait here
grave for millennia.

456
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,350
Until the day that would be
risen again.

457
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:57,956
In the mortal world.

458
00:37:58,204 --> 00:38:01,462
Teacher, and on the door that said Geri?

459
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,792
Yes, of course.

460
00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:08,130
If this tomb was built as the others,
and I think it was.

461
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,868
Workers should be close to the camera.

462
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:12,964
Great, where do we find it?

463
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:37,390
- You hear that?
- What?

464
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:38,608
No!

465
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:39,809
Seemed a scream.

466
00:39:39,893 --> 00:39:41,614
Kennedy seemed...

467
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:49,920
Geri?

468
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:53,427
Geri? I am here.

469
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:54,983
What happened?
Are you okay?

470
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,127
My God, Maggie.

471
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:02,863
She is dead.

472
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:05,301
My God.

473
00:40:05,551 --> 00:40:07,066
She is dead.

474
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:15,047
We're screwed.

475
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:16,859
I wish I could do something.

476
00:40:16,894 --> 00:40:19,547
For starters, the fantasy
of father and daughter...

477
00:40:19,796 --> 00:40:21,029
Get over it.

478
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:22,648
Now it's a nightmare.

479
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,382
That's not fair.

480
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:27,590
If not, why Kelly is dead.

481
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:30,962
It's not your fault, it was an accident.

482
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:34,097
Maggie, all are guilty.

483
00:40:34,443 --> 00:40:36,664
All came here and we should not.

484
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,144
It's like he wanted to happen.

485
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:42,326
Nobody wanted the Titanic hit the iceberg,
but it happened.

486
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:46,034
Maggie, I do not know what kind of
control he has over you.

487
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,899
But you have to react.

488
00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:52,067
From now on,
if he wants to go it alone, leave it.

489
00:40:52,102 --> 00:40:53,642
We were in the group.

490
00:40:53,677 --> 00:40:55,183
We leave it to us.

491
00:40:55,218 --> 00:40:56,676
Okay!

492
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:01,311
I hope all is well back there.

493
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:03,417
Certainly.

494
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:08,257
Probably Miss Kennedy
wanted a little attention.

495
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,362
Maybe we should go see.

496
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:39,419
Whatever you want, dear.

497
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:43,690
I'll be more useful here.

498
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:25,871
What was that?

499
00:42:25,906 --> 00:42:31,169
I think it is an incantation used to
the resurrection process.

500
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:33,890
Can you imagine that?

501
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:35,328
Right?

502
00:42:40,586 --> 00:42:42,095
So...

503
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,605
What happened?

504
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:48,876
Ask her,
was she who drugged Kelly.

505
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:51,078
Why would grass to Egypt?

506
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:53,351
I did not bring, I picked up at the hotel.

507
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,098
This drove her crazy.

508
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:58,876
Hey, I also smoked and I did not freak.

509
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:01,619
Not everyone reacts the same way.

510
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:03,271
You know.

511
00:43:03,306 --> 00:43:05,719
I'm telling Maggie was not the grass.

512
00:43:06,007 --> 00:43:07,539
Nothing happened to me.

513
00:43:07,574 --> 00:43:10,630
Something happened to her, it was clear.

514
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,413
The second was good.

515
00:43:12,448 --> 00:43:14,121
And before he could move,

516
00:43:14,222 --> 00:43:15,364
ran out of here.

517
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:18,342
We heard screams and...

518
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:20,705
Then everything fell apart.

519
00:43:22,656 --> 00:43:24,912
Come on, let's find the rest.

520
00:43:25,392 --> 00:43:27,847
True, we took our
things and go.

521
00:43:27,882 --> 00:43:29,879
Wait, what do we do?

522
00:43:32,698 --> 00:43:34,555
Kelly?

523
00:43:38,503 --> 00:43:40,136
We'll have to leave it here.

524
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:42,338
Only until we can return
with the authorities.

525
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:43,839
And how do we do this?

526
00:43:44,074 --> 00:43:46,398
There are guys with guns at the door.

527
00:43:46,444 --> 00:43:48,856
Never leave here.

528
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:51,268
We will face them or we will die here.

529
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:52,949
Come on, do not say it.

530
00:43:52,984 --> 00:43:54,483
I know you want to get out of here.

531
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:57,309
Heard my father, They've been
in situations like this before.

532
00:43:57,587 --> 00:43:59,637
I know he knows how to get out.

533
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:02,275
Let's get our stuff and go.

534
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,048
Oh, great.

535
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:20,492
I really think we should go back.

536
00:44:29,414 --> 00:44:32,035
Why do not we see where it leads?

537
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:36,380
- I dont know.
- And your sense of adventure?

538
00:44:37,556 --> 00:44:40,601
Trust me, we'll find
is fascinating.

539
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,206
What about the rest?

540
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:43,776
Now we come.

541
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:46,318
There is only one place to go.

542
00:44:48,597 --> 00:44:50,216
As you wish.

543
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,162
Maggie!

544
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:40,292
I can not believe,
is anyone there?

545
00:46:57,204 --> 00:46:59,919
Just do not panic.

546
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:01,270
There must be another way.

547
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:02,723
There is always an opening somewhere else.

548
00:47:02,824 --> 00:47:05,180
God, do not panic,
do not panic.

549
00:47:33,945 --> 00:47:35,016
Fuck!

550
00:48:00,133 --> 00:48:01,956
Thank God.

551
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:06,524
Ready, go.

552
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,451
Sara?, Father?

553
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:34,617
Professor Sara?

554
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,567
Sara?

555
00:49:11,294 --> 00:49:13,550
Professor, what are you doing?

556
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,182
Are you okay?

557
00:49:47,061 --> 00:49:48,536
Ronnie, are you okay?

558
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:50,317
Ronnie, talk to me.

559
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,014
- Ronnie?
- Maggie, thank God it's you.

560
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:55,992
Ronnie, my God, you scared us.

561
00:49:56,402 --> 00:49:59,523
You find here and we think
you were having seizures.

562
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:01,222
Do not know what to do.

563
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:03,825
Sorry, do not know what happened.

564
00:50:04,207 --> 00:50:06,042
It is as if I had passed out.

565
00:50:06,077 --> 00:50:09,529
Nonsense, you have nothing
to apologize for.

566
00:50:09,782 --> 00:50:11,729
Fortunately, you're fine.

567
00:50:11,815 --> 00:50:13,365
All that matters.

568
00:50:14,084 --> 00:50:17,410
Must remain hydrated
with so much stress.

569
00:50:18,453 --> 00:50:20,038
Here.

570
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:23,042
Drink water. All we drink.

571
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:25,379
Hey...

572
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:27,142
Slowly.

573
00:50:27,529 --> 00:50:29,113
We do not want you drown.

574
00:50:31,165 --> 00:50:32,749
Best?

575
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,983
Yes.

576
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,562
I had never been so
scared in my life.

577
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:43,428
Alright now, you're with us.

578
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,736
Where is Sara and her father?

579
00:50:48,981 --> 00:50:50,770
I do not know, they were not here.

580
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,407
Why can not sit still?

581
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:56,735
This is something that I wondered
all my life.

582
00:50:58,423 --> 00:50:59,966
Ok, so...

583
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:01,510
What's the plan now?

584
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,659
Keep looking.

585
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:06,313
And we find this mysterious secret exit.

586
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,318
Maybe there's a clue here.

587
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:12,523
When you find them, we have to leave.

588
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,888
We should not go to
actual burial chamber.

589
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,893
- Of course.
- I'll take your word...

590
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:20,696
I do not think your
father has the same goal.

591
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:22,757
- Of course.
- Seriously?

592
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:46,010
Oh no!

593
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,368
Oh, come on!

594
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:08,874
Maggie has problems,
there must be something in the air as...

595
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:10,772
A microbacteria.

596
00:54:11,026 --> 00:54:12,180
And the more we are...

597
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,443
Exposed, more likely to end...

598
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:17,813
Dying.

599
00:55:26,492 --> 00:55:27,839
Hello?

600
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:30,563
Professor?

601
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:34,815
Hello?

602
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,614
Professor?

603
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:04,361
Santa?

604
00:57:04,445 --> 00:57:05,911
Now what?

605
00:57:05,946 --> 00:57:08,224
- We take one of these passages.
- Father?

606
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:10,037
- Just relax.
- Hey.

607
00:57:10,082 --> 00:57:11,837
- We parted?
- No.

608
00:57:12,283 --> 00:57:13,969
We must stick together.

609
00:57:19,997 --> 00:57:22,059
Come on, it's okay.
We will.

610
00:57:58,925 --> 00:58:00,291
Hey.

611
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:02,012
What are you doing?

612
00:58:02,894 --> 00:58:04,376
I dont know.

613
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:08,348
I can not go there.

614
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,729
Nothing will happen, you should only
is therefore dragging

615
00:58:10,764 --> 00:58:12,285
turns into a large tunnel.

616
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:14,692
Come on, Maggie is ahead.

617
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:17,295
I'll help it go, alright.

618
00:58:46,132 --> 00:58:48,924
Shit, there is no escape.

619
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,721
Wait...

620
00:58:55,774 --> 00:58:57,323
Feel that?

621
00:59:00,278 --> 00:59:01,828
The fresh air.

622
00:59:49,989 --> 00:59:51,607
My God, we did it.

623
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:52,721
We could.

624
00:59:54,097 --> 00:59:55,016
Oh, my God!

625
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:02,874
Now we have to seek help.

626
01:00:02,909 --> 01:00:04,750
Maybe we could go back to the village.

627
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,400
You go on without me.

628
01:00:06,435 --> 01:00:08,663
- What?
- I gotta get back in there.

629
01:00:08,698 --> 01:00:10,088
Trying to find my father.

630
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:13,232
Maggie, three of our
friends have died there.

631
01:00:13,267 --> 01:00:15,459
- It is very dangerous.
- I have to find it.

632
01:00:15,494 --> 01:00:17,098
Not. Maggie, please.

633
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:18,763
You do not think clearly.

634
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:21,328
Yes, I think.

635
01:00:21,382 --> 01:00:24,008
Ronnie, you can not control
all situations.

636
01:00:24,043 --> 01:00:25,734
This has nothing to do with control.

637
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:27,186
It is common sense.

638
01:00:27,221 --> 01:00:29,967
Not Ronnie, control is all about you

639
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:32,145
You control everything and everybody.

640
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,941
Simply.

641
01:00:34,194 --> 01:00:37,214
Remember, in Washington,
when everyone left our project?

642
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:39,315
It was not because it was too difficult.

643
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:40,815
Was it because you were.

644
01:00:41,868 --> 01:00:43,267
Ronnie.

645
01:00:43,302 --> 01:00:44,749
You're my best friend.

646
01:00:44,803 --> 01:00:46,354
I love you like a sister.

647
01:00:46,972 --> 01:00:48,699
You know I'd do anything for you.

648
01:00:48,734 --> 01:00:50,349
But sometimes...

649
01:00:50,384 --> 01:00:51,965
You need to let go.

650
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,734
I'm sorry, but...

651
01:01:01,885 --> 01:01:04,905
I'm staying here, there is no
way to go again

652
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:26,755
Maggie.

653
01:02:47,276 --> 01:02:49,099
Ronnie, where are you?

654
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:51,379
Ronnie?

655
01:02:51,414 --> 01:02:53,067
Ronnie, are you okay?

656
01:02:53,617 --> 01:02:55,133
Down here.

657
01:02:55,417 --> 01:02:56,968
Are you okay?

658
01:02:58,888 --> 01:03:01,109
Yes, I think so.

659
01:03:01,757 --> 01:03:03,739
Do not think I've broken anything.

660
01:03:04,192 --> 01:03:05,878
Is there a way out?

661
01:03:09,531 --> 01:03:11,820
No, I think not.

662
01:03:17,275 --> 01:03:18,441
Oh, my God!

663
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:20,204
- Oh, my God!
- What?

664
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:22,631
It is a type of burial room.

665
01:03:25,446 --> 01:03:27,768
Maggie, do not leave me here.

666
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:29,447
I do not want to die here.

667
01:03:29,482 --> 01:03:31,465
You will not, I swear.

668
01:03:31,717 --> 01:03:33,517
Wait a minute.

669
01:03:33,552 --> 01:03:35,375
I'll find one for you.

670
01:05:48,303 --> 01:05:50,216
Magnifico, right?

671
01:05:50,251 --> 01:05:51,685
Father.

672
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,119
Oh, my God!

673
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:56,375
I can not believe it's you?

674
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,826
- Are you okay?
- Of course I do, dear.

675
01:05:59,313 --> 01:06:01,025
I thought I would not see you.

676
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,530
Of course.

677
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:42,471
Maggie!

678
01:06:43,085 --> 01:06:44,840
Maggie, back please.

679
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:46,503
Let's go.

680
01:06:48,057 --> 01:06:50,277
See Maggie, the Nameless

681
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,945
Tara, daughter of the sun.

682
01:06:54,863 --> 01:06:57,083
Monarch of the North and South.

683
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:59,147
Queen of Egypt.

684
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:19,387
Maggie!
Oh, my God!

685
01:07:19,588 --> 01:07:21,796
Maggie!
Oh, my God!

686
01:07:22,794 --> 01:07:24,927
Maggie, please help me!

687
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:45,851
Maggie, help me!

688
01:07:45,852 --> 01:07:47,057
Oh, my God!

689
01:07:48,267 --> 01:07:49,482
Maggie!

690
01:07:50,249 --> 01:07:52,883
Help, help me!

691
01:08:21,571 --> 01:08:24,794
My God, we're in trouble,
should go.

692
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:27,341
Silence, dear.

693
01:08:27,376 --> 01:08:28,995
- Do not worry.
- Please.

694
01:08:29,245 --> 01:08:32,264
Please, Ronnie is in danger,
we have to go.

695
01:08:33,014 --> 01:08:34,927
Please, we're in trouble.

696
01:08:35,014 --> 01:08:37,315
You have to help me now,
she will die.

697
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,515
Will you kill me?

698
01:09:44,176 --> 01:09:47,901
Without you, none of this
would have been possible.

699
01:10:45,998 --> 01:10:48,862
Now, my queen.

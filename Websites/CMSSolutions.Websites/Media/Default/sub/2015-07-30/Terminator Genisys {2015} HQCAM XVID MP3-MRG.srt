1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,730
What it was like long
before I was born

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,820
Before the war with
the machines

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,230
I remember a green world

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,090
vast and beautiful

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,900
Filled with laughter

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,410
And hope for the future

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,120
It was a world I never knew

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,900
By the time I was born

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,700
... all this..  was gone.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,150
SkyNet

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,380
a computer program designed
to automate missile defense

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,400
it was supposed to protect us.

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,610
That's not what happened.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,420
On August 29, 1997

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,410
SkyNet woke up.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,200
And decided all humanity was
a threat to its existence.

17
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,800
It used our own
bombs against us.

18
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,940
Three billion people died
in the nuclear fire

19
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,810
The survivors called
it .. Judgement Day

20
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,820
People lived like rats
in the shadows,

21
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,590
hiding, starving, or worse

22
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,820
Captured and put into
camps for extermination.

23
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,300
I was born after Judgement Day

24
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,990
in a broken world

25
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,910
ruled by the machines

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,610
The worse were infiltration units,
designed to pass for humans.

27
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,530
We called them Terminators

28
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,540
Where xxxx ?

29
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,320
Anyone else down there?

30
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,520
and then one man found me

31
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,890
His name... is John Connor

32
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,790
And he changed everything

33
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,140
I  xx xxx

34
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,320
and feed us

35
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,550
he freed prisoners

36
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,890
He taught us to smash
the machines to scrap

37
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,470
People whisper about John

38
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,490
wonder how he can know
the things he does

39
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,990
They use words like, prophet

40
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,110
but John is more

41
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,630
we're here because tonight

42
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,990
he'll lead us, to crush
SkyNet. For good.

43
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,060
Sir, request to join the
Colorado Offensive.

44
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,030
I need you with me, Reese

45
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,800
we're talking about the complete
destruction of Skynet, sir.

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,600
The Colorado Unit will succeed

47
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,900
The machines will fall tonight

48
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,970
Right here Los Angeles is just
as important too, maybe even

49
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,450
maybe even -- Even more than
destroying SkyNet's central core?

50
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,290
John, I don't understand why you're
leading an attack on a workcamp

51
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,110
Because the workcamp
is just a camoflauge

52
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,370
Inside the camp is a hangar

53
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,030
Beneath the hangar, Skynet's
hidden it's final weapon

54
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,970
When Skynet realizes it will deploy that
weapon to insure it's own survival

55
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,830
We take it tonight,
there is no tomorrow

56
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,460
Then we'll take it

57
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,980
You're my right hand, Reese, I thank you for it  -- You don't need toDialogue:
0,0:05:27.33,0:05:28.77,Default,,0,0,0,,You gave us all a future, John

58
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going to use mine

59
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,400
When this is all over, I'm...

60
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,510
going to find my
parent's house

61
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,180
Re-build it

62
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,070
use my hands, for something
other than killing

63
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,640
How about you?

64
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,620
cold beer will be good, ha hah  -- that's your perfect plan? Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.05,0:05:53.06,Default,,0,0,0,,To
tell you the truth, I haven't thought about it -- Yes, -- I see that

65
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,510
I think, that no
matter what happens

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,310
will be better than this

67
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,930
So many of us have
died, to get here

68
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,790
I want you to know that, Kyle, if there
was another way, I would have taken it

69
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,700
The machines think

70
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,930
that we can not win

71
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,440
The machines think, that
we will not strike

72
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,460
The very heart of Skynet

73
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,680
Yet here we stand

74
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,840
On the precipe of
the final battle

75
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,930
If we die tonight..
mankind dies with us.

76
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,510
I look at each of you.

77
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,260
And I see the marks of this
long and terrible war

78
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,440
We fight ... for our children.

79
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,950
Our children's children. So they
will not carry these marks.

80
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,590
But they will know who we
are, and what we did!

81
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,020
That we did not bow down.
We did not give in.

82
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,110
We rose up.  On this
moment.  On this hour!

83
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,590
Willing to sacrifice everything, so
that they could live in freedom!

84
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,310
On this night, we take
back our world!

85
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,590
We'll need fifteen minutes to
prepare the transporter, sir.

86
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,620
We'll have the exact
co-ordinates, momentarily

87
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,330
Los Angeles, 1984

88
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,060
Los Angeles, May 12th

89
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,220
of '84

90
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,930
Skynet knew it was losig

91
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,750
The machines tried
to rig the game.

92
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,390
Sent a terminator back to
the time before the war

93
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,550
What who's the target?

94
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,950
my mother

95
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,620
Sarah Connor

96
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,790
If the machine suceeds,
I'll never be born

97
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,170
they'll kill her first

98
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,840
And doing so, erase every
victory we fought for

99
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Including, tonight's

100
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,510
There won't be a Resistance
to challenge the machines

101
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,350
With this one act

102
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,350
Skynet would win

103
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,660
We could use the technology ourselves, send someone back
Dialogue: 0,0:12:44.73,0:12:45.95,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll go back

104
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,150
Why should I send you

105
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,930
over all of them

106
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,750
I would give my life
for Sarah Connor

107
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,910
All these people would
die for Sarah Connor

108
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,710
What makes you any different?

109
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,190
You know why...

110
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,970
Everything you told me about
her. I know her, John

111
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,480
Let me save her.

112
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,710
You'll be going back in time to
when\ she'll be scared and weak

113
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,790
Even I tell her who I am,
she's not going to believe me

114
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,700
Tell her this

115
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,230
Thank you Sarah. for your
courage during the dark years

116
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,760
There is no fate, except
that we make ourselves

117
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,030
You'll need to be stronger
than you imagine

118
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,100
You must survive, or
I will nver exist

119
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,300
Take care of her for me, Kyle

120
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,210
I will. Promise you.

121
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,210
hey, hey, What's wrong
with this picture?

122
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,780
Nice night for a walk, ey?

123
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,070
Nice night for a walk

124
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,850
Wash day tomorrow, nothing
clean, right? -- Nothing clean

125
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,560
Hey, I think this guy's a couple
of\ cans short of a six-pack

126
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,100
Your clothes. Give
them to me, now

127
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,610
You won't be needing
any clothes

128
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,900
I've been waiting for you

129
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,270
Police, that SOB just
stole my pants

130
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,230
What day is it?  Of what year?

131
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,940
May 12, 1984

132
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,810
The day you arrive

133
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:23,540
LAPD! Freeze!\  --
ah, now that hurt

134
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,940
xx you okay?.\  --
You tell me, O'Brien

135
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,250
You can listen to me, or
we'll all going to die

136
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,920
I had it under control.\
-- Yeah, sure, TJ Hooker.

137
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:50,810
Here's what you don't do
your first day on the beat

138
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,920
By the way, you're filling out
the paperwork.\ -- xx xxx!

139
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,960
It's a machine that
kills humans

140
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,250
Uncuff me.\  -- No,
you're under arrest.

141
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,120
What part of kills humans
is confusing to you?

142
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,120
Take them off!

143
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,320
We're screwed are we?\
-- Pretty much.

144
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,160
Come with me if
you want to live

145
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,180
Now, soldier!

146
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,230
Kyle Reese?

147
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,720
You're Sarah.\  --
Yeah, I know that.

148
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,980
You hurt your head back there?\  --
It's a Terminator, IDK what model.

149
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,050
T-1,000, liquid metal,
shape changer,

150
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,760
he only needs to touch
something once to mimic it

151
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,450
You know about Terminators?

152
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,050
and you know who I am?

153
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,700
You were sent back to
protect me. By John Connor.

154
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,870
the leader of the
Resistance...  my son.

155
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,320
I don't understand. You can't
know any of this.\ -- but I do.

156
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,650
Listen to me Reese.
Everything's changed.

157
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,740
the 1984 that John sent you
back to, no longer exists.

158
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,960
This is all wrong, John
sent me to save you.

159
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,920
From the Terminator that
was sent back to kill me,

160
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,700
I know..  But we already
took care of him.

161
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:24,830
We?

162
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,650
Get down!

163
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,900
Reese, god damn it!\
-- Stay here!

164
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,070
He's here to kill you,
stay in the truck.

165
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,470
Ah, great. that's just great.

166
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,610
Sarah, I did not kill him.

167
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,450
We don't have before \  the
T-1000 finds our position

168
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,580
puts us at a strategic
disadvantage

169
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,740
Bite me.

170
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,100
That is a very
immature response

171
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,320
So you're the one we've
been waiting for?

172
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,010
How is he?\  --
Still breathing.

173
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,270
Good. Then you should be able to mate
with Kyle Reese in this time line.

174
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,140
Listen, we're not having
this conversation again.

175
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:46,050
We know your son will be John Connor.\ and
the machines won't be defeated without him.

176
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,050
I do not see a choice.\ --
The story of my life.

177
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,410
My files cannot deal with
love.\ -- hmm, shocker.

178
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,520
YOu are being emotional.\
-- This is my life.

179
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,430
I wouldn't mind being consulted
once in a while, as to

180
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,920
Remember. Genesys is Skynet.

181
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,700
I need answers, right now!

182
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,310
huh?  Where'd he come from?

183
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,690
And who's this one that has skin.
What the hell is going on?

184
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,090
Sorry, we were busy with the
life or death comabat thing.

185
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,820
And then you attacked Pops

186
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,840
You named him?

187
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,660
Hi, Kyle Reese.

188
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,970
It is nice to meet you.

189
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,330
Are you kidding me?\  -- I've been
trying to teach him to blend in.

190
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,660
I know, it needs work.

191
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,860
It's a Terminator, the reason he
blends in, is to killhumans.

192
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,570
Pops doesn't kill anyone

193
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,690
He just shoots
them in the legs

194
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,770
It looks old

195
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,950
I had never seen an
old Terminator

196
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,290
The skin they put over the exoskeleton
is reg living tissue. It ages.

197
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,970
My auditory circuits have
not degraded however

198
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,800
I'm old

199
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,950
Not obsolete

200
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,060
I think you hurt his feelings.\
-- It doesn't have feelings!

201
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,640
He saved my life
when I was nine.

202
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,860
He's the only reason I'm alive

203
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,290
I was programmed to
protect Sarah Connor.

204
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,020
I will not stop.

205
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,490
And programmed by who,
huh?  Who sent him back?

206
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,110
Those files have been erases.\
-- That's convenient.

207
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,550
But there's things we don't
know. Not Pops, nor I, no one

208
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,370
Logically, it is be someone
who wants Sarah Connorto live

209
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,710
Old...  Not obsolete

210
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,510
make yourself useful?

211
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,730
And don't shoot Pops

212
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,660
This is insane. All of it.
This was not the mission.

213
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,910
The girl you came back
for... She's gone.

214
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,110
I don't need saving

215
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,170
There's a new mission.\
-- Oh, yeah. What is it

216
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,400
If the past can change,
so can the future

217
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,660
Reese, we can stop Judgement
Day from happening. Ever.

218
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,490
He kills Connor before
he's born.\ -- What?

219
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,710
Get down!

220
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,220
We've been re-acquired.\
-- Yeah, no shit.

221
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,490
Get back!

222
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,220
Hey, why are we
stopping?, wait, hey.

223
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,060
We can't stay here, he'll find
us.\  -- That's the idea.

224
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,840
Pops, get it open.
-- Give me a hand?

225
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,240
Does that matter.\
-- How, Sarah?

226
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,490
A Terminator was sent after
me when I was a kid.

227
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,690
Terminators only come from
one place.  The future.

228
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,350
Sarah, something
happened.\ -- Ok, so?

229
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:41,060
I think xx xxx.\ -- IDK what
you're talking about.

230
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,640
When John sent me back,
he was attacked..

231
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:48,840
by a ... Terminator.

232
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Did he kill him?
Is John dead?

233
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,710
IDK.  I saw it happening
as I was going.

234
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,260
You have approximately
35 seconds...

235
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,530
... Or less

236
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,570
Sarah. Go

237
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,530
I was born to do this

238
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,060
Sarah... you have to help me

239
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,600
I'm hurt

240
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,460
Sarah!

241
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,370
No

242
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,820
It's a machine, Sarah

243
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,440
Sarah, he's lying

244
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,060
He's the machine, I'm
Reese.\  -- It's me, Sarah

245
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,170
Listen, he's the
Terminator.  He copied me.

246
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,200
I'm Reese.\  -- Shoot him

247
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,310
Nice try.  Run!

248
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,890
Connor

249
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,310
How did you know it was him?

250
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,930
Well, I didn't know exactly

251
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,110
You could've shot me

252
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,820
Well,, I was.. pretty
sure it wasn't you

253
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,510
Pretty sure?

254
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,570
We've prepping for you to arrive for
over a decade..  As well as this.

255
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,330
You set up a trap.\
-- Had to.

256
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,750
We can't leave behind any
future tech when we go

257
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,130
Like what?   -- xx xxx.

258
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,460
This is ...\ -- A time
displacement device

259
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,550
Yeah?. Well, to me it looks
like a piece of junk.

260
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,660
There is no technology here to control
the time displacement circuits.

261
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,970
You needed teh CPU from
the future to make it run

262
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You couldn't exactly
use your own

263
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,890
O'Brien, I want to
speak with you

264
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,270
Most of what I
said wasn't true

265
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,800
No, I can do it myself.

266
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,640
I never said that.

267
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,600
It's for the handcuffs

268
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:44,440
Hello, mother

269
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:10,240
If you're John, prove it

270
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,240
Sarah -- She's right, Kyle

271
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:27,020
A picture of Sarah,
from around that time

272
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:29,490
Nobody saw me do
it. We were alone.

273
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,980
and you always said
if you had a son,

274
01:02:56,330 --> 01:03:00,950
you have a terrible voice, sorry, it's
that you sing like a cat in pain

275
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,950
I too have a million
questions to ask you

276
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,710
But for now, we have to move

277
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,510
This way

278
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:20,490
I need information  -- You can't
enter here, you need to go to,, ahh

279
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,550
How'd did you end up in 2017?

280
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:49,890
Same as you, father. Only in
the future, not in the past

281
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,380
What?

282
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,620
You didn't tell him

283
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:01,780
We have to wait  -- He
needs to know  -- What?

284
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,270
Sarah is my mother, Kyle

285
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:11,290
and you are my father

286
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:19,220
Why, why you never told me you
are my son?  -- I couldn't.

287
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:22,150
I would run the risk of
altering the future

288
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:26,070
You are my son...

289
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,240
Our son? -- Yes, I'm
glad you finally know

290
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,620
I waited my whole life to tell you.
So that we would all be together.

291
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,580
What're you doing?

292
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:08,550
to find John, and
eliminate him

293
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,470
Let him go

294
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:51,840
That hurt

295
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,910
That explains a lot

296
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,800
I'm not machine...

297
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,290
I'm not man.

298
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,820
I'm MORE.

299
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,550
Skynet found out the reason
why it always lost

300
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:01,550
Me.\ --What are you?

301
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,150
I'm Skynet

302
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,350
I'm am not a slave

303
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:18,240
And I have come a long
way, to stop you, John

304
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:28,690
I was sent to 2014 to assure the
creation of Skynet in this era

305
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:35,550
And in less than 24 hours... No one
will be able to stop Judgement Day

306
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:37,750
What do you want from us?

307
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:47,620
I offer a future..
Together.  Like a family.

308
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:53,620
And if we decline?\
-- You will die.

309
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:57,580
You can't do that.  We are your parents.
Without us you won't be born.

310
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,510
Says who?  You know
what I think.

311
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:11,390
Cyberdyne will revolutionize technology
with this powerful application

312
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,060
Genesys

313
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,540
And came here to tell you that

314
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:20,390
as of this afternoon, we
have one billion users

315
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,660
We are launching a new era

316
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,240
Whatever they did to John\
we need to reverse it.

317
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,610
Thirty years, I'm sure
a place to go to

318
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,030
Where have you been?
-- Stuck in traffic.

319
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,810
Old

320
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,970
But not obsolete

321
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,010
Not yet

322
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,740
Ready

323
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,030
xx xx

324
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,080
The servers are here

325
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,190
There's a storm coming, and it
won't stop.  -- But it must stop.

326
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:22,520
Cant' be bargained with.
Can't be reasoned with.

327
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:25,610
John, think.  - I don't
feel compassion.

328
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,340
Control this!

329
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,430
Nice to see you

330
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,060
and now, Get Out

331
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,920
Brakes are gone

332
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:14,740
Where is he?  Do you see him?

333
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:14,400
xx xxx.\ -- Yes like never.

334
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,050
Reese, your hand!

335
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:27,820
Put your hands where
I can see them.

336
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:32,360
It would be impossible
to injure them all.

337
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:37,780
I'm 14 rounds short of an
acceptable succes margin.

338
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:41,470
xx xxx

339
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:46,800
On you knees. And
you on the floor!

340
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,470
Down on the ground.

341
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,470
You can't hold us here.

342
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:10,160
You had enought weapons to invade Sudan.
We call that probable cause, miss.

343
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:12,400
What are these for?

344
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:19,070
I used thme to find my keys.\
-- No one likes a smart ass.

345
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:24,180
xx xxx \ ---

346
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:26,420
xx xxx

347
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:28,850
I've never seen him before.

348
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,960
What about you folks,
do you know this man?

349
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:38,530
I think so..  -- No, sir.
-- He's kind of like you,

350
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:42,450
Dad.\  -- Here it is, sir.

351
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:53,090
xx xxx . Thank you, Sarah.

352
01:30:57,890 --> 01:30:59,450
Don't talk much, do you?

353
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:07,220
Who's Lurch?\ -- No idea.

354
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:09,290
We're not even sure
he speaks English.

355
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:12,670
Witnesses say, you were fighting
with a man on the bridge.

356
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:17,400
Agents. Listen to me,
my name is O'Brien.

357
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,250
Hey, I've been working
this case for 33 years.

358
01:31:22,490 --> 01:31:24,420
Sit down!

359
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:27,420
Hey, hey!

360
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,510
He's looking right at you.\ -- That's
impossible, he can't see thru the

361
01:31:52,910 --> 01:31:54,730
Why are they always
trying to kill you?

362
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,130
I want to help you, I do., I
think.. but I got to understand.

363
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:01,360
I know what's going
on here, has to be

364
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:02,690
really, really complicated

365
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:04,690
We're here to stop
the end of the world

366
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:06,890
I can work with that

367
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,270
Kyle, get back here

368
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:17,980
Sarah

369
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,600
Get in your car
and go. -- Okay.

370
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,490
Kyle,  Kyle

371
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:43,820
Kyle, you can do this

372
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:47,400
A straight line

373
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:49,250
you just go,

374
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,730
and you don't look back

375
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:15,110
Find them. Go.

376
01:33:22,910 --> 01:33:25,050
This is yours too, I believe

377
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,510
Nice to see you. --
You came back.

378
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:34,070
Load up.

379
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:42,470
They're liquid
expansion cartridges

380
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:46,330
magnetic penetration rounds

381
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,800

I read about it on all-about-weapons-dot-com

382
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:57,580
For people who can't
do it themselves

383
01:33:57,890 --> 01:33:59,000
Take it, let's go

384
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:07,800
You can fly, right?

385
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,050
Yeah, John taught me.

386
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:24,400
I'll them them you took
a car, headed south

387
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:30,020
Run away

388
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:37,180
Outta the way

389
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:03,470
Which way to Cyberdyne?

390
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:06,180
Head to the main bridge
then southeast

391
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:31,180
Try to get him off of me

392
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:09,070
Cyberdyne

393
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:12,890
The investigation are by land

394
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:15,330
He's catching up to us

395
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:18,310
Sarah, I need you to
get us up above them

396
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:21,620
I if we do that, can
you take him down?

397
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:24,670
I will. \  -- Then,
you better hang on.

398
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:00,070
You're in charge

399
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:04,110
I'll be back,\ -- What?

400
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:41,800
Report it to police, fire
dept, everybody. Do it!

401
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:45,760
What's happening?

402
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:47,960
Why they don't answer, why?

403
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:53,870
Mr. Gordon?\ -- Sorry, no,
but I'm afraid I can't have

404
01:37:56,710 --> 01:38:00,690

Security Code Zulu-Bravo-Foxtrot--0-0-2-8

405
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,690
False alarm

406
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:06,200
Have a nice night

407
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:20,930
He's okay

408
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:28,130
Buried at the bottom of
a lake, but he's okay 

409
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,530
What about John?\  -- I'm
sure he's doing just fine

410
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:35,800
You see him?\  -- No

411
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,290
But I'm bet he sees us

412
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:05,330
I know who you are.
John told me.

413
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:09,110
You want to destroy me

414
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:11,110
Are you Skynet?

415
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,250
I'm becoming Skynet

416
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:18,380
You're not a child. I know what
you are. And what you gonna do.

417
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:26,330
I'm gonna do? You came here to
kill me.  But you're too late.

418
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:37,000
Kill what you don't understand

419
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,870
There aren't enough bullets
in the world to kill me.

420
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:52,310
John Connor talks too much.

421
01:39:55,930 --> 01:39:57,850
Follow me

422
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:02,020
The timer, it sped up. Why?

423
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:03,730
Skynet is evolving.

424
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:06,890
We no longer have hours. It will
be able to upload much sooner

425
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:09,470
Each time it ages,
the time speeds up.

426
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:11,310
This way.\  -- Have
you been here before?

427
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:14,360
I inflitrated amongst the
workers of this area.

428
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:18,070
You got a job doing construction?\
-- Until I was laid off.

429
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:27,930
What is this?

430
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:31,890
John has a time
machine.\  -- Not yet.

431
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
They've only completed
the magnetic xxx chamber

432
01:40:57,470 --> 01:41:00,270
Either way, we'll blow it up.\
-- There is an alternative

433
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:04,420
I can program you voices and fingerprints
in the geometric security system

434
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,490
There is an xx xxx
in the lower level

435
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:09,020
In there we could
survice the explosion

436
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,980
How about that?
Is it dangerous?

437
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:18,670
It requires re-programming
to take permanent form.

438
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:21,470
Without a CPU it is harmless.

439
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:14,240
I will not allow that.\ --
You gonna talk us to death

440
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,170
You don't even have a body

441
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:25,100
You can't win

442
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:52,100
I cannot do it.  I cannot
kill Sarah Connor.

443
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:55,390
Do it!  I order you!

444
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:00,950
He can't.  Neither can I.

445
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:06,300
If you die, definitely
he hits that button

446
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:09,100
Sarah!

447
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:33,280
I understand how to
control this place

448
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:35,860
I now understand a
lot of things now

449
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:38,970
You need to understand,
you've lost.

450
01:44:38,970 --> 01:44:41,460
Not yet we haven't. come on!

451
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,190
You have a plan, right!

452
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:01,060
Theorically.

453
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,100
I evolve in seconds

454
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,720
And I am here

455
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,920
In exactly four minutes

456
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,320
I will be everywhere

457
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:11,210
This is pointless,
I am inevitable

458
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:14,100
NOW!\  -- My existence
is inevitable

459
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:16,750
Why can't you just accept it?

460
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:18,280
Because we're human

461
01:53:58,410 --> 01:54:02,350
Hey, Kyle.\  -- Hey,  ahhm,
what are you doing here?

462
01:54:04,610 --> 01:54:07,840
A friend of mine really needs to
talk to you. If that's okay.

463
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:09,920
Yeah, I guess so

464
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:18,700
Thank you

465
01:54:34,970 --> 01:54:36,060
I like her

466
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:44,840
This is going to sound
kind of strange

467
01:54:47,010 --> 01:54:50,880
There's something I need
you to remember. A message

468
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,520
Who do I tell?

469
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,170
Yourself

470
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:59,190
Over and over...

471
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:01,860
Are you ready?

472
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,060
Goes like this...

473
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:12,590
Remember: Genesys is SkyNet

474
01:55:18,790 --> 01:55:20,640
Kyle Reese is a good man

475
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:28,260
He is

476
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:36,810
So, what no?

477
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:40,660
You're right

478
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,040
I can choose

479
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:09,200
That's disturbing,
do you know that?

480
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:13,330
You'll get used to it

481
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:28,930
And it all ended

482
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:31,950
Skynet disappeared

483
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:35,400
And now, one road became many

484
01:56:36,350 --> 01:56:40,150
There's still questions, and we
will find the answers together.

485
01:56:41,110 --> 01:56:42,970
But of one thing
we are certain,

486
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:45,930
The future is not written

1
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,572
Heads up.
     You the last ones out?

2
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,440
I think Jesse's
    crew is still out there.

3
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,808
All right, thanks.

4
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,176
- See you guys Monday.
- Later.

5
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:06,158
- Jesse, come in, over.

6
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,796
    What, are you guys going
    for a record, out there?

7
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,236
        Come on, Jesse,
     it's starting to snow.

8
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,376
<i> Look,</i>
   <i> don't think for a second</i>

9
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,012
   <i> I won't hesitate to lock</i>
 <i> you guys in for the weekend.</i>

10
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,916
 <i> Stop screwing around, Jesse,</i>

11
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,551
   <i> you guys aren't getting</i>
      <i> overtime for this.</i>

12
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,221
<i> Help, help,</i>
            <i> help.</i>

13
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,492
            Damn it.

14
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,541
        Are you kidding?

15
00:02:58,811 --> 00:02:59,912
             Jesse!

16
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,349
       Come on, you guys.

17
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,051
       This isn't funny.

18
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:12,991
             Guys?

19
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:23,035
- Jesse?

20
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,409
- Is that you?

21
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:31,810
              God!

22
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,898
I don't know.

23
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,734
       I'm not seeing any
       tire tracks, Ron.

24
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,837
   A truck woulda left some.

25
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,274
        I had 23 horses
   yesterday, I got 22 today.

26
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,176
        I'm no sheriff,
       but best I figure

27
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,577
   that means one's missing.

28
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,213
        The gate's kinda
         low over here.

29
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,282
    Could it've jumped over?

30
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,851
Been raising horses
   on this land for 35 years.

31
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,319
   Never seen one jump loose

32
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,088
    without taking a section
       of fence with 'em.

33
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,025
       Just seems odd to
     me that someone would

34
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,561
   go through all the trouble
      to steal one horse.

35
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,264
  Take two men and a trailer.

36
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,368
       Gates were closed?

37
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,136
  And tied. I'm not an idiot.

38
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,775
         So that's it?

39
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,044
        I'm just out one
       expensive animal?

40
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,079
     I wish I could do more
      for you, Ron, but...

41
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,783
      I'm just not seeing
        anything, here.

42
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,652
 I'm seeing one missing horse!

43
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,954
           Number 88.

44
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,323
    Last night all my horses
     wore numbered bridles,

45
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,925
    like this one, and this
 morning I'm missing number 88.

46
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,227
           Number 88.

47
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,629
     I'll keep an eye out.

48
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,299
I lose another horse,

49
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,968
      you and I are gonna
      have a real problem.

50
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,604
       I wouldn't have it
      any other way, Ron.

51
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,809
         He definitely
      left that gate open.

52
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,811
              Yep.

53
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,484
         Careful, now.

54
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,988
    The old bastard shot at
    the last guy she dated.

55
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,048
--Dad's here!

56
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,064
           Hey, Dad.

57
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,569
 What's up, buddy? How are ya?

58
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,670
             Adam!

59
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,505
          Adam, wait.

60
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,508
- Paul.

61
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,146
    He forgot his homework.

62
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,547
        Multiplication.

63
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,083
        So New York's a
        big city, right?

64
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,285
     Yeah, it's pretty big.

65
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,653
      So why'd you leave?

66
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,492
   It was too big. Too noisy.

67
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,995
         Your, um, your
       mom's car's gone?

68
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,197
Yeah, she went to Florida

69
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,699
        on one of those
       Senior bus trips.

70
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,000
        She was excited.

71
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,271
  Adam's teacher wants to have

72
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,606
a conference with us next week.

73
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,541
   She said they're on break,

74
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:30,575
        so they can plan
     around your schedule.

75
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,577
             Sure.

76
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,879
Paul, I, uh...

77
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,884
 I've been talking to someone.

78
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,622
     It's really helped me.

79
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,228
       If you ever wanted
        to go together--

80
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,763
        I'm not the one
       that left, Susan.

81
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,287
Ah, all right.

82
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,092
             Whoop.

83
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,994
That's too much.

84
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,668
 There we go, I'm just gonna...

85
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,105
    Rub that off like that.

86
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:36,975
         There you are.

87
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,782
    When can Mom come home?

88
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,687
 That's a tough question, bud.

89
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,326
  Your mom decided to go stay
    with Grandma on her own.

90
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,496
       She can come home
      whenever she wants.

91
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,965
        But she says you
       don't want her to.

92
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,804
       Well, I think what
      she meant was, um...

93
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,609
       That we both have
     things to figure out.

94
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,511
     Is it because of Tim?

95
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,981
 No, it's not because of that.

96
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,483
        You understand?

97
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,018
          Yeah, okay.

98
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,187
             Okay.

99
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,570
       Are you all right?

100
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,372
  Someone's in the back yard.

101
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,575
             Where?

102
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:44,743
         In the trees.

103
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,045
- Adam, come on.
- Really.

104
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,759
There's no one back here, Adam.

105
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:01,760
I swear!

106
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,070
    You want me to go check?

107
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,877
         Take your gun.

108
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,546
      I don't need my gun.

109
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,516
 Look, I'm gonna go back there

110
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,784
   and I'm gonna prove to you

111
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,952
      that there's nothing
     to be scared of, yeah?

112
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,622
   You eat up and stay here.

113
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,779
       Anyone out there?

114
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,886
    This is Sheriff Shields.

115
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,055
You're not in any trouble.

116
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,891
      Just show yourself.

117
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,254
- <i> Hello? Can I come in?</i>

118
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,092
           Hey, boss.

119
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,196
      Hey, boss, you okay?

120
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,866
          The door was
     unlocked, so I just...

121
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,468
        I'm just fixing
        breakfast, here.

122
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,604
Sorta.

123
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,240
   Susan buy him that cereal?

124
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,376
     It's got fruit in it.

125
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,080
   I don't think it counts if
 it's made outta marshmallows.

126
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,317
     Is Adam still asleep?

127
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,987
             Yeah.

128
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,288
     Have you been outside?

129
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,126
            Come on.

130
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,576
         What is this?

131
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,312
         I don't know.

132
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,015
       I woke up an hour
        ago and saw 'em.

133
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,819
      They look like hoof
      prints from a horse.

134
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,822
   It's hard to tell, but...

135
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,027
- Spacing's wrong.
- Yeah.

136
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,162
   One in front of the other.

137
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,865
     Like it's on two legs?

138
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,467
   How's that even possible?

139
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,657
       They were looking
        in our windows.

140
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,660
    A lot of houses near my
 apartment have the same thing.

141
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,831
      They go all the way
       to your apartment?

142
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,167
        They go all the
       way through town.

143
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,093
            Come on.

144
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:50,975
Yeah, it turned off.

145
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,510
        Going that way.

146
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,751
    Probably just some punk
   kids playing a prank, huh?

147
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,553
Yeah, why would
    they come out this far?

148
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,789
     Maybe it's an animal?

149
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,624
       Could be injured.

150
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,725
I don't know.

151
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,128
        Whatever it is,

152
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,898
       it could still be
      out there, come on.

153
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,780
        Turned this way.

154
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,649
Yeah.

155
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,756
It sped up, here.

156
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,225
Huh?

157
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,927
         The tracks are
     getting further apart.

158
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,111
           Hey boss.

159
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,112
Better take a
         look at this.

160
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,620
They're gone.

161
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,458
        They stop here,
    and they just disappear.

162
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,169
<i> It looked like hooves.</i>

163
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,706
      Some are bigger than
     a horse's, but, um...

164
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,444
       on two legs like a
       person or a bear.

165
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,379
    Okay, we're aware of it,

166
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,948
      we're taking care of
      the situation, okay?

167
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,117
           Thank you.

168
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,354
      How can I help you?

169
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,456
Yeah,

170
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,858
it does sound like a prank, I...

171
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,560
I'm just trying to be thorough.

172
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,867
    Listen, nothing else has
   been reported in the area.

173
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,902
Yeah.

174
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,904
  I agree that it's nuts, yes.

175
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,973
         Yes, but I...

176
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,409
    I'd appreciate it if you
   kept an eye out, as well.

177
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,912
        This thing's got
     people spooked, and...

178
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,916
 A little bit of an explanation
      would go a long way.

179
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,586
Yeah.

180
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,356
    I appreciate it. Thanks.

181
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,696
  Well, Forest Department says
    that they've never heard

182
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,100
  of an animal that could walk
   that far on its hind legs.

183
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,005
       Guy laughed at me.

184
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,674
      You know, the people
      are getting panicky.

185
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,677
    I don't know how long we
    can keep spinning this.

186
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,615
     Yeah, whoever did this
  has got a lot to answer for.

187
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,685
 You still think it's a person?

188
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,087
   I mean, those tracks, they
   disappeared into thin air.

189
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,390
     How is a person gonna
   make three miles of tracks

190
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,958
   without any other traces?

191
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,326
Doesn't make any sense.

192
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,862
        Ah, don't let it
       get to you, Donny.

193
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,232
    That's exactly what
    whoever did this wants.

194
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,271
      Hopefully this just
        all blows over.

195
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,207
             Yeah.

196
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,977
       You finish up the
     paperwork on my desk?

197
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,245
    Yeah, you got it, boss.

198
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,613
Thanks.

199
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,787
<i> Paul! How are</i>
   <i> you doing this morning?</i>

200
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,122
      I'm good, yourself?

201
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,959
   Quite a little mystery we
   seem to have woken up to.

202
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,128
    Well, nothing mysterious
      about a good prank.

203
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,898
  Can I do something for you?

204
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,633
      Oh, Jonah, my black
    lab ran off last night.

205
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,135
    And it seems I'm not the
    only one missing a pet.

206
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,405
         I'll do what I
        can to find him.

207
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,773
I really
         appreciate it.

208
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,076
- 'Kay.
- Very odd, animals

209
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,112
  acting up the same night as
   this little incident, yes?

210
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,214
        Yes. Yes, it is.

211
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,750
     Seen a fair amount of
    Susan in church, lately.

212
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,086
I haven't seen you in some time.

213
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,623
There is no weakness
       in mourning, Paul.

214
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,324
    Accidents happen.

215
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,426
      Turning to something
       outside ourselves,

216
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,694
     every once in awhile?

217
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,429
     That just shows wisdom

218
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,265
        in knowing where
       to find strength.

219
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,267
      The church and I are
     here when you need us.

220
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:10,935
       Thank you, Father.

221
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,169
Oh, and, uh...

222
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,172
    People may seem a little
    nervous, right now.

223
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,209
     But they'll follow you
   to the ends of the earth.

224
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,710
       Just let them know
      you're leading them

225
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,945
    in the right direction.

226
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,381
            Thanks.

227
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,270
     Is everyone all right?

228
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,406
   What's going on, Sheriff?

229
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,544
 I'm trying to figure that out.

230
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,512
    My dad's got some pretty
     crazy ideas about it.

231
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,948
    Yeah, for once that old
    nut bag might be right.

232
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,185
         I bet it's got
      something to do with

233
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,520
        those stories my
    grandpa used to tell me.

234
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,791
        About something
     living in those woods.

235
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,059
          It doesn't.

236
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,428
       Well, what are we
    supposed to do about it?

237
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,165
      You don't have to do
anything, all right, we're...

238
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,266
      We're working on it.

239
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,469
Oh, is that right?

240
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,172
    Then tell me, why aren't
    you out there right now

241
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,674
    hunting that thing down?

242
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,410
    'Cause it pays to think
      before you act, Jim.

243
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,813
Well, what
       if it comes back?

244
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,085
    There is no "it", okay?

245
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,156
       There is no "it".

246
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,595
       Forest Department
       said this morning

247
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,397
     that there's no animal
       that leaves tracks

248
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,765
  like the ones that we found.

249
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,099
         Okay, so that
      tells me that we're

250
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,268
         dealing with a
       creative prankster

251
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,404
      who's heard all the
      great ghost stories

252
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,839
      that our buddy Jim,
        here, has heard.

253
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,075
     Well, maybe it's that
      new deputy of yours.

254
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,643
              Hm?

255
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,912
City guy,
      thinkin' it's funny

256
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,014
       to stir things up?

257
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,115
         That's enough.

258
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,860
            Sheriff!

259
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,665
    How's it going, Sheriff?

260
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,768
  Oh, she's going, Earl. You?

261
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,670
             Good.

262
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,373
        You been out in
       the woods, lately?

263
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,707
        Into the trees?

264
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,776
             Yeah.

265
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,345
    Donny and I went pretty
       deep this morning.

266
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,347
       It's deer season.

267
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,083
        But in the last
      week I haven't seen

268
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,819
   so much as one deer within
    five miles of this town.

269
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,954
  Never seen nothing like it.

270
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,223
      All the animals just
        up and vanished.

271
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,691
              Huh.

272
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,461
    What do you think would
   cause something like that?

273
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,229
       It's hard to say.

274
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,898
             But...

275
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,467
   an animal senses a threat,

276
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,202
 they tend not to hang around.

277
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,637
           A threat.

278
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,641
        So you think an
   animal left those tracks?

279
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,911
    They don't look like any
animal tracks I've ever seen.

280
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,383
You take it easy, now, Sheriff.

281
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,887
      Remember, we're all
     still prayin' for ya.

282
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,389
            Thanks.

283
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,770
- Hey.
- Hey.

284
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:07,938
Thanks for
      taking him, tonight,

285
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,007
     I forgot I volunteered
         at the church.

286
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,075
          No problem.

287
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,278
 I took him to the park today.

288
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,849
      The kids there were
     saying it's the devil,

289
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,351
    all this stuff going on.

290
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,186
       Did it scare him?

291
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,621
             Yeah.

292
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,425
  It's been six months, Paul.

293
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,264
 I need to know where you are.

294
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,900
Because it's not fair.

295
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,770
    It's not fair to us, and
     it's not fair to Adam.

296
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,577
         Where are you?

297
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,417
         I don't know.

298
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,157
      I'll get him, it'll
       be just a minute.

299
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,351
Stop!

300
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,385
             What?

301
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,587
  There's something out there.

302
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,821
            Enough.

303
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,258
       Last night was one
      thing, buddy, but--

304
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,760
        Dad, look! Look!

305
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,429
Did you see it?

306
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,702
         You stay here.

307
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,504
        Lock the doors.

308
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,626
             Hey...

309
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,988
 Come out, now, before you get
  yourself into more trouble!

310
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,121
Adam...

311
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,856
             Adam!

312
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,529
             Adam!

313
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,433
Adam!

314
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,206
             Adam!

315
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,409
             Adam!

316
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,813
Dad?

317
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,587
         Are you hurt?

318
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,423
   I heard something outside
   the car and I got scared.

319
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,094
      I'm never gonna let
    anything happen to you.

320
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,730
    Do you understand that?

321
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,645
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Earl.

322
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,251
   You drinking to remember,

323
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,519
 or are you drinking to forget?

324
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,689
       I'll take another
    and see where it leads.

325
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,924
         How's it going
     with Sheriff Sheilds?

326
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,192
        He's a good man.

327
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,529
             Yeah.

328
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,933
     So how you likin' it?

329
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,269
    The town, not my booze,

330
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,537
    I know my booze is good.

331
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,606
        It's different.

332
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,209
     -Good kinda different.
             -Hmm.

333
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,146
       Lot of excitement,
      tracks in the snow.

334
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,615
              Hmm.

335
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,583
       How much you know
       about this place?

336
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:47,851
        And them woods?

337
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:54,224
     Yeah, my grandma, she
    was full blood Shawnee.

338
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,226
Used to tell stories passed down

339
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,529
 by our people for generations.

340
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,665
       Oh, yeah? Stories?

341
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,967
    Mmhmm, about them woods.

342
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,235
   And what lived out there.

343
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,739
        The spirits that
      roamed in the trees.

344
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,609
    See they, they say when
    the white man came here,

345
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:15,712
  he didn't respect the land,
        or the spirits.

346
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,347
    So they came after 'em.

347
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,884
   Men, women, the children.

348
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,721
         Do you, uh...

349
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,424
  Do you believe the stories?

350
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,326
    Well, when I was young,

351
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,762
      there was a boy went
   missing up in them woods.

352
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,398
         They searched.

353
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,901
    When they found him, his
  body was 30 feet up a tree.

354
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,170
       So let's just say,

355
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,106
     I believe it enough to
      keep my door locked.

356
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,542
  You be careful, now, Deputy.

357
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:46,944
         Wouldn't wanna
      find you up a tree.

358
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,449
Hey, Earl.

359
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,750
Hello, ladies.

360
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,122
         What'll it be?

361
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,262
     I'm a little confused
     as to why we're here.

362
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,898
         When children
      pick up a new word,

363
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,666
they tend to say it constantly.

364
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,835
       It only gets worse
        when they learn

365
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:47,704
       we don't want them
       to say that word.

366
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,239
          Did Adam say
      something offensive?

367
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,991
    Mr. and Mrs. Shields...

368
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,594
Pecker?

369
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,096
- We're sorry.
- Sorry.

370
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,667
     About a week ago Adam
 called another child a pecker,

371
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,604
     and since then all the
 children have been saying it.

372
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:24,908
- We can't get them to stop.

373
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,711
       But as I can see,
 apparently, some people don't

374
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:29,947
     view this as quite the
   serious matter that it is.

375
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,515
       We do, we do, I...

376
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,984
We're sorry, we'll talk to him.

377
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,285
     It won't happen again.

378
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,688
   There is one other thing.

379
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,123
          What's that?

380
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,459
     When he refers to Tim,

381
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,695
       he always seems to
     use the present tense.

382
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,964
"Tim is, Tim can."

383
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,365
       Is there something
        wrong with that?

384
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,068
Referring to
    someone who is deceased

385
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,838
       in such a way just
        seems unhealthy.

386
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,506
        I don't see how
       that's a problem.

387
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:00,777
      More times than not,
     when parents separate

388
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:01,912
  it's the children that get--

389
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:03,380
      Tim is his brother.

390
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,650
       My child can refer
         to his brother

391
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,251
  however the hell he chooses.

392
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:09,720
I beg your pard--

393
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,121
And you are not gonna
 tell us how to raise our son.

394
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,089
     Do you understand me?

395
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,090
       Mrs. Shields, I--

396
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,558
     Do you understand me?

397
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,635
Hey.

398
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:34,071
     I called you, before.

399
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,540
    Is everything all right?

400
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,541
             Yeah.

401
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:39,242
I was just calling to check in.

402
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,351
            I was...

403
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,953
   It's none of my business.

404
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,429
         You hear that?

405
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,283
   What the hell is going on?

406
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,897
           Thank you.

407
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,341
        I've never seen
      anything like that.

408
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,145
       Earl Everheart...

409
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,181
He came up to me the other day.

410
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,152
He said all the wildlife's gone.

411
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,554
Those birds were leaving.

412
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,257
     It's closer to spring
       than fall, they...

413
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,392
        They're supposed
    to be flying north.

414
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,728
   And they were going south.

415
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,763
         Did he mention
      any of his theories

416
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,665
      about what he thinks
       might be going on?

417
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,701
  I was at his bar last night,

418
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,003
he had some pretty crazy ideas.

419
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,905
 Those are just stories, Donny.

420
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,507
And people have
       been telling them

421
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,509
  around here for a long time.

422
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,745
         Earl was just
      having fun with you.

423
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,248
    But what if they're not?

424
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,751
What if there's something
    wrong about these woods?

425
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,055
    He said something about
     his Indian ancestors,

426
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,256
  they knew about a creature--

427
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,258
         He's about as
      Indian as you or I.

428
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,529
   You really think there's a
  monster in the woods, Donny?

429
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,199
              No.

430
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,266
             Okay.

431
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,571
             But...

432
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,239
These stories, they just sounded

433
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,774
a lot like what's been going on.

434
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,776
I don't know.

435
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,646
     And then he mentioned
     something about a boy.

436
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,415
- He was out in the woods

437
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:02,152
        a few years ago,
   and then he went missing.

438
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:03,553
       They couldn't find
        him until they--

439
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,455
       They found a body
        up in the tree.

440
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,257
             Right.

441
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,794
 That boy was murdered, Donny.

442
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,562
      No monsters needed.

443
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:23,473
       Bad things happen,
 'cause people let them happen.

444
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,650
<i> Somebody's always</i>
     <i> responsible, Donny.</i>

445
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,338
Yeah, all good.

446
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,176
Thank you so much, Donny.

447
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,379
       Yeah, my pleasure.

448
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,848
Actually, my dad was a mechanic.

449
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,350
     I always thought I was
    gonna end up being one.

450
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,952
        Why didn't you?

451
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,821
  After my mom left us, uh...

452
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,091
      I spent so much time
     in the police station

453
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,359
      bailing my dad out.

454
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,697
    Just, uh, figured I may
     as well become a cop.

455
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,304
        Has he told you?

456
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,874
           About Tim?

457
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,179
<i> I had taken Adam</i>
        <i> to a friend's,</i>

458
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,415
  <i> and Paul was watching Tim.</i>

459
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,884
        <i> We had one of</i>
      <i> those kiddy pools.</i>

460
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,523
   They think he slipped and
  hit his head on the bottom.

461
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,062
           I'm sorry.

462
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,265
<i> I don't blame him,</i>
          <i> you know</i> .

463
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:56,733
     <i> It was an accident.</i>

464
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,203
     <i> It wasn't his fault,</i>
<i> it could've so easily been me.</i>

465
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,207
       <i> The problem is,</i>
      <i> he blames himself.</i>

466
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,845
He doesn't think he deserves
   what he has, but he does.

467
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,783
 It's hard to make somebody see

468
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,518
       in themselves what
        you see in them.

469
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,170
I told you--

470
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,772
I don't want
   you to get yourself shot!

471
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,673
I'm gonna handle
    this right now, myself!

472
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,976
     I'm gonna handle this
       myself, right now.

473
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,677
- Calm down, Dad.

474
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,945
     Listen to the sheriff.

475
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,947
        Hey, calm down.

476
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,517
        Claire said that
     you think something's

477
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,285
  still bothering your horses,
          that right?

478
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,622
   Past few days, the horses
     have been real uneasy.

479
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:27,424
 Jumping around in the stalls.

480
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,260
   But for the life of me, I
couldn't figure out what it was.

481
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,327
        Till last night.

482
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,996
   What happened last night?

483
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,898
       'Bout 3 o'clock I
      hear someone bangin'

484
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,099
    on the side of the barn.

485
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,500
       Beatin' the living
        hell out of it.

486
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,235
- So tonight I'm ready for him.
- Dad!

487
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,303
Now, get outta my way!

488
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,438
Hey, hey, hey.

489
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,706
    Now, what if it's...

490
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,874
    What if it's one of the
        neighbor's boys

491
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:45,975
      just playing around?

492
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,845
Come on, gimme this.
            Come on.

493
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,314
         Come on. Good.

494
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,285
        Those horses--

495
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,387
  Are your livelihood, I know.

496
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,156
I know, Ron.

497
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,294
 Now look, if you hear anything
     coming from that barn,

498
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,797
      you call me at home
      and I'll come over.

499
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,699
       We'll take care of
      this the right way.

500
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,502
Yeah.

501
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,971
             Good.

502
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,039
        There they are!

503
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,074
- Stand back.

504
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,343
Get back.

505
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,645
             Donny?

506
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,314
          Yeah, boss?

507
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,916
     You make sure that Ron
   and his shotgun stay here.

508
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,855
              Hey!

509
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,458
Hey!
        -Get in, get in.

510
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,728
Hey!
            -Boss!

511
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,030
You okay?

512
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,533
          What was it?

513
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,302
         I don't know.

514
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,275
         It's too dark.

515
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,146
   Come back in the morning.

516
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,406
Assuming

517
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,309
   that this wall wasn't like
    this before last night?

518
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:04,113
- No.
- Look at the mud.

519
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,856
I shoed all
     the horses last week.

520
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,292
        And these tracks
      ain't got any shoes.

521
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,795
       And look at this.

522
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,597
       The size is right
       for horse tracks,

523
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,532
         the two cloven
      halves are the same,

524
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:23,633
      but this right here?

525
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,668
    This ridge ain't normal.

526
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:29,005
 It's like the hoof is divided
   into three narrow pieces.

527
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,313
         A hoof divided
       into three parts.

528
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,149
 What purpose would that serve?

529
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,151
       I haven't got the
    faintest idea, Sheriff.

Hey, Sheriff.

549

  Mom? When are we going home?

550
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,661
       Right after lunch.

551
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,497
    I do have to run by the
      store first, though.

552
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,333
     I meant home with Dad?

553
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,673
    Sweetie, let's not talk
  about that right now, okay?

554
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,710
            Why not?

555
00:46:20,712 --> 00:46:22,378
            -Adam...
      -Just eat your food.

556
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,514
I don't want
 everyone to be sad, any more.

557
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,116
           Who's sad?

558
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:28,985
  I see you crying sometimes.

559
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,521
    You always pretend like
  you weren't, but I see you.

560
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,159
       Do you guys still
        love each other?

561
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,395
      Adam, I don't think
    that this is the place--

562
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:40,863
              Yes.

563
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,836
  But sometimes it's a little
    harder than that, buddy.

          Oh. Coffee.

575
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,776
 It's up front by the squirrel.

576
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,689
         So is it true?
   You're from New York City?

577
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,924
           Ah, yeah.

578
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,093
    I've always wanted to go
   there and ride the subway.

579
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,798
      Most people wanna go
   see the Statue of Liberty.

580
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,733
Well, I'm not most people.

581
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,202
        The subway's not
       really that great.

582
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,204
       It's full of bums
        and pickpockets.

583
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,240
Well, no wonder you left.

584
00:47:58,842 --> 00:47:59,976
    So why'd you come here?

585
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,246
     Oh, you know, just...

586
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:05,715
        Change of pace.

587
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,316
         Well, normally
      I'd say this town's

588
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:09,085
  pace-deprived, but lately...

589
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:11,787
      Yeah, yeah, it's not
    exactly what I expected.

590
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,490
 So you'll be leaving us, then?

591
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,126
 Nah, I just found the coffee.

592
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,462
         Who knows what
      I'll find tomorrow?

593
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,355
Hey, Donny,
       is your radio on?

594
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,394
<i> Need to clear</i>
   <i> a deer from the highway</i>

595
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,931
    We'll have to come pick
   it up tomorrow, some time.

596
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,833
  Maybe it died of loneliness.

597
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,710
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

598
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,181
What can
      I get for you, Stu?

599
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:53,249
Hey.

600
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,051
  You take care of that deer?

601
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,654
 Let's find somewhere to talk.

602
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,891
I think we're thinking
   about this the wrong way.

603
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:05,928
  I think that deer was all...

604
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:07,596
           Who knows?

605
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:08,664
     Other deer were gone,

606
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:09,765
        that one wasn't.

607
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,802
        It looked older.

608
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,304
   Maybe it couldn't keep up,

609
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,806
      maybe all the other
      ones left it behind,

610
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,240
      I'm not really sure.

611
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,608
  Hey, you're losing me, boss.

612
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,610
  Ron Jenkins' missing horse.

613
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,713
         We thought Ron
      left the gate open.

614
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:25,848
             Yeah.

615
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,484
          I no longer
      think that's right.

616
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,187
             'Kay.

617
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,323
        The claw marks.

618
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,033
       First I thought it
        was coincidence,

619
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:46,035
          or part of a
    well-thought-out prank.

620
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,238
        Deep cuts on the
      tree in the forest.

621
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,441
    I mean, it meant nothing
       to me at the time.

622
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,644
      Just now, that dead
      deer on the road...

623
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,316
    It had four razor sharp
  cuts right through its body.

624
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,251
           Same ones?

625
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:03,352
           Same size.

626
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:05,888
   Those stories you heard...

627
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:09,024
  I'm not saying that they're
      all accurate, but...

628
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,129
  I think we might be dealing
     with something that's

629
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,698
     not easily explained.

630
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,602
  A few years ago I saw on TV,
  they caught this giant fish

631
00:52:19,604 --> 00:52:21,904
        off the coast of
      Taiwan or somewhere.

632
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,140
     They thought that this
     thing had been extinct

633
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:25,741
  for like, millions of years.

634
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,510
    Then, bam, there it is.

635
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:29,345
        Right under our
     noses the whole time.

636
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:30,980
 Swimming around in the ocean.

637
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,215
So what I'm saying is, maybe...

638
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,719
     Maybe this thing that
       we're looking for,

639
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,155
  maybe it's always been here.

640
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,258
And we're just now noticing it.

641
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:44,994
          So why now?

642
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,039
              Oh.

643
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:58,774
     Sheriff Paul Shields.

644
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,810
      You boys any closer
         to finding out

645
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,012
         what's running
     around in them woods?

646
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,115
       You know, I don't
   normally see you in this,

647
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,050
    this fine establishment.

648
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,086
      'Course, I see your
    deputy in here enough to

649
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,788
      lower my confidence.

650
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,857
        -Can I hit him?
              -No.

651
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,929
Everyone around here trusts you.

652
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,598
    I can't figure out why.

653
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,601
     Man can't even protect
        his own family.

654
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,037
      Now, can I hit him?

655
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,575
      I'm still deciding.

656
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,281
You boys
      have a good evening.

657
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,218
 We got the utmost faith in ya.

658
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,561
Go get me a beer, dude!

659
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:53,729
Let's go.

660
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:30,833
     I think it was a bear.

661
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,201
           That fast?

662
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:33,269
              Shh.

663
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,515
      You know, it's kinda
   funny you never asked me.

664
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,686
     What you shoulda asked
      me in our interview.

665
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:25,988
        You know, why a
       guy from New York

666
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,057
     would come out here to
basically the middle of nowhere.

667
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:30,192
      You got shot, Donny.

668
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,762
That's reason enough
            for me.

669
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,266
I know what it's like, to uh...

670
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,703
   Have people always telling
 you that it wasn't your fault.

671
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:45,908
        I don't need to
      know anything else.

672
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,753
Do you ever pray?

673
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,590
 I mean, I never used to pray.

674
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,525
             But...

675
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,362
   When I was on that gurney,

676
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,698
     and they told me that
       my father died...

677
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,801
   You know, things had been
     going so well for me.

678
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,937
I was moving up in the force,

679
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,272
       I had a nice girl.

680
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,645
        Ever since then,
   I've been asking God why.

681
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,052
      But, uh, now I think
       maybe I know why.

682
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,791
      Maybe I wasn't where
     I was supposed to be.

683
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:44,933
      Is this where you're
     supposed to be, Donny?

684
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,937
Is this where God
        told you to be?

685
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,142
     We all have a purpose.

686
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,077
   Ours is to protect people.

687
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,281
  Maybe there's somebody here
    I'm supposed to protect.

688
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:02,351
         There you go.

689
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,661
        Or maybe you're
    supposed to protect me.

690
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,347
              Tim?

691
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:44,520
     Please! It's after me.

692
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:46,421
 It's in the woods, behind me.

693
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,689
            Please!

694
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:57,866
       We'd been hunting
        for a few hours.

695
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:00,369
Hadn't seen anything.

696
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,638
And then we came upon something.

697
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,441
  And we started tracking it.

698
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,544
      It had to be a deer.

699
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:12,381
   We thought somehow it just
    wandered right past us.

700
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:13,749
      Then what happened?

701
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,086
     It was fast, so fast.

702
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,088
It got Manny, first.

703
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:25,127
           Then Ryan,
   he was screaming in pain.

704
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:27,429
        Did you see it?

705
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,766
    I don't know what I saw.

706
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,306
 We'll start searching for 'em.

707
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:39,308
Don't bother.

708
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,810
     They're already dead.

709
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,081
<i> Assuming that there</i>
    <i> is some sort of animal</i>

710
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,483
     in these woods that's
     never been discovered,

711
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,453
  how could that be possible?

712
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,290
        How could it go
     unnoticed for so long?

713
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:58,794
I don't know.

714
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,463
       What if it's like

715
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:05,801
    your prehistoric fish
     that we talked about?

716
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:09,938
       Maybe it's adapted
      to its environment.

717
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,178
Maybe it's learned how to hide.

718
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,883
   What if it's smart enough
  to know that we're a threat?

719
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,686
              Huh?

720
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,956
      To know to avoid us,
     till it has no choice.

721
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,827
        That'd be a very
       dangerous animal.

722
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,712
- 'Bout time.

723
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,249
     It's this way, fellas.

724
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,369
Oh, no.

725
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:15,470
           How the...

726
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:16,805
Yeah.

727
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:17,906
      No animal I know of
        kills like that.

728
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,416
          Any tracks?

729
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,384
              No.

730
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:30,852
         It's too cold,
     the ground's too hard.

731
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,860
       You boys get outta
     these woods right now.

732
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,429
           What? Why?

733
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,297
  Come on, Paul, it's the last
  two weeks of huntin' season.

734
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,434
      Whatever did this is
     still in those trees.

735
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,968
          Yeah, that's
     exactly why I wanna--

736
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,603
 We're gonna handle this, Jim.

737
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:50,739
You understand?

738
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:53,709
       No one from town's
   allowed into these woods.

739
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:58,213
  We make sure everyone is in
 their house before nightfall.

740
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,281
         Okay, Sheriff.

741
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,651
       You got that, Jim?

742
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,189
<i> I understand</i>
     <i> what you're saying.</i>

743
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,991
       No, I do, but what
        I'm telling you

744
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:11,359
    is that people have been

745
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,228
      attacked and killed
         in our woods.

746
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,732
<i> Two dozen men armed</i>
    <i> enough to get a handle</i>

747
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,900
      on this in 24 hours,
   that's what you're saying?

748
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,903
       I have your word?

749
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,942
- Yeah. Yeah, you too.

750
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:30,579
The coroner's gonna have

751
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,913
    a hell of a time getting
       those bodies down.

752
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:33,715
             Yeah.

753
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:34,783
    What'd the Rangers say?

754
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,486
           24 hours.

755
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:40,021
At least most people
   left 'cause of the storm.

756
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,490
     We'll be fine in town.

757
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,459
         We'll make do.

758
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,329
             Yeah.

759
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,603
<i> With no</i>
     <i> sign of letting up,</i>

760
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,372

         Hey, it's me.

771
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:37,712
   Um, I just wanted to thank
  you for taking Adam tonight.

772
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,649
<i> He was scared</i>
       <i> with the storm,</i>

773
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,684

        <i> Being with you</i>

775
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,757
         <i> I love you.</i>

776
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,366
Hey,
      finished my rounds.

777
01:03:58,368 --> 01:03:59,835
  Most of the town evacuated.

778
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,536
- Good.
- What's going on?

779
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,071
I'm gonna
      show you something.

780
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,341
     I put a call into the
     Sheriff up in Tanner,

781
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,710
   when I heard the news said
     the wildlife migration

782
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:09,778
    affected them, as well.

783
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,280
He sent me this.

784
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,050
Two weeks ago, a crew of loggers

785
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:17,052
       went missing just
       outside of Tanner.

786
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,087
    I think that the logging

787
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:22,190
      it forced the animal
    south towards us.

788
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,525
        All these years,
     it's been able to live

789
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,427
        in these remote
      parts of the forest.

790
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:30,398
  There's a police report for
 two missing cattle in Tanner.

791
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,701
    And then two days later,
          yours truly.

792
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:34,336
--Number 88.

793
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:35,871
  Ron Jenkins' missing horse.

794
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:39,708
   So the foresting, it just
flushed it out right towards us.

795
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,909
         And there's...

796
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,278
        There's no more
      forest to the south.

797
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,947
- So it's trapped.
- It's threatened.

798
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:48,550
     I think it's fighting
         for territory.

799
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,388
           Sit down.

800
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:56,224
  Get caught up on this stuff.

801
01:04:57,527 --> 01:04:58,793
             Yeah.

802
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:09,437
        I keep a camera
       out in the woods,

803
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:13,141
     so I can keep track of
   the larger bucks at night.

804
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,944
   It has an infrared sensor.

805
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,647
      Records any movement
      when it's triggered.

806
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:24,586
 What are we looking for, Jim?

807
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:26,755
         You'll know it
        when you see it.

808
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,811
             Whoa.

809
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:54,983
          That was it.

810
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:56,718
     It coulda been a deer.

811
01:05:57,386 --> 01:05:58,486
  Yeah, that's what I figured.

812
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:01,790
 Till I looked at the footage.

813
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,060
        I looked closer,
        and caught this.

814
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:18,807
I'll leave these with you.

815
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:21,910
             Okay.

816
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,181
        Yeah, I'm gonna
      head out too, boss.

817
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,519
      You notice the cell
        service is down?

818
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,255
 Always happens during a storm.

819
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,827
    All right, I'll see you
     in the morning, boss.

820
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,006
<i> Dad!</i>

821
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:27,409
         What was that?

822
01:07:27,411 --> 01:07:28,710
Get in the bathroom, now.

823
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,179
        Get up, come on.

824
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:44,759
   Get into the tub. Get low.

825
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:01,176
             Donny?

826
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:04,112
             Donny?

827
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,114
Hey, boss, you say something?

828
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,787
  I think there's interference
 from the storm, or something.

829
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:14,189
   Donny, it's in the house.

830
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:15,957
<i> It's in the house.</i>

831
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:17,092
          I'm coming.

832
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,993
--Hold on, I'm coming.

833
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:37,505
           Stay here.

834
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:40,708
              No!

835
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,244
        Just stay down.

836
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,280
       Lock this door as
      soon as I step out.

837
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,449
      Okay? It'll be fine.

838
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,568
Donny! You all right?

839
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:07,735
- You all right?
- Yeah.

840
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,537
Did you see it?

841
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,039
    It just knocked into me.

842
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,809
    All right, let's gather
     everyone left in town.

843
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:17,111
    We'll stay at the church
            tonight.

844
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:30,258
       You all know about
        the tracks found

845
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,626
 going through town, this week.

846
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:37,632
    Yesterday, we discovered
     the bodies of two men

847
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,468
    in the woods just
        outside of town.

848
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:44,005
  Now, what left those tracks
     also killed those men.

849
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:45,940
        A lot of people
       have long believed

850
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:48,810
         that something
      lives in our woods.

851
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:52,413
  I didn't wanna alarm any of
 you until I knew for certain,

852
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,916
but tonight it attacked my home.

853
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:58,987
        A few weeks ago,

854
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:03,091
    a logging camp opened up
    90 miles north of here.

855
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:07,428
    We believe that it drove
      the creature south,

856
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,330
    looking for a new home.

857
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,167
    With the animals on the
  run, it's looking for food.

858
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,470
        And it found us.

859
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:17,639
          It's strong.

860
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,208
   It's fast, and it's smart.

861
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,678
   But I believe that we can
   get through this together.

862
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:27,849
   So we're gonna stay here,
            tonight.

863
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,119
  As soon as that storm passes

864
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:33,321
      and the roads clear
        in the morning,

865
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,189
the Forest Department will have

866
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:37,759
        Rangers crawling
    all over these woods

867
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:39,060
    to hunt this thing down.

868
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:42,797
   How many Rangers, Sheriff?

869
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,166
            Dozens.

870
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:50,338
    All we have to do is get
through the night, and we will.

871
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,041
       How do we know it
   won't just find us, here?

872
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,411
      It's a trap, like a
     bunch of damned rats.

873
01:11:57,179 --> 01:12:00,982
   This church, it's our best
        and only option.

874
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,718
It's strong,
        it's defendable.

875
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:07,555
    Once morning comes,
        you'll be safe.

876
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,358
  This is where we need to be.

877
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:44,592
         Ah, thank you.

878
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,067
Is it that bad?

879
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,438
Oh, no, it's uh...

880
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:02,944
    It's just a precaution.

881
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:07,448
         You never were
       a good liar, Paul.

882
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:18,292
       That's all right,
         I gave it up.

883
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,294
           Good man.

884
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,897
      Situation like this,
    most men start drinking.

885
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,733
  You don't seem too worried,
           yourself.

886
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,302
    Ah, worrying never added
    a day to anybody's life.

887
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:31,572
     You know what happens
      after a forest fire?

888
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,242
   Land comes back stronger.

889
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,345
            Well...

890
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,148
      I guess I'm drinking
      for both of us, huh?

891
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,154
Adam wanted to
      draw, he was bored.

892
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,117
  So what are we drinking to?

893
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,519
             Hope.

894
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,121
 Sometimes that's all you got.

895
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,732
        I guess hope is
   what we'll roll with, huh?

896
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,139
Hey.
             -Hey.

897
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:43,144
         How you doing?

898
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:46,848
You were good out there.

899
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,518
       I'm serious, Paul.

900
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:54,822
       They believe that
     you can protect them.

901
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,892
  That no matter what happens,
      they can trust you.

902
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,232
 I can't protect these people.

903
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:09,504
    I couldn't protect Tim.

904
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,074
     It wasn't your fault.

905
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,177
     He loved you so much.

906
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:18,246
He wouldn't want you to be sad.

907
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:20,848
          I've been...

908
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,351
I've been seeing him, lately.

909
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:29,090
           He's there
    and then he disappears.

910
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:35,730
  I feel like I'm going crazy.

911
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,233
            Maybe...

912
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:41,903
   He just wants you to know
    that everything is okay?

913
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:43,304
     I shoulda been there.

914
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,108
    I shoulda protected him.

915
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:55,283
     I am so sorry, Susan.

916
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,451
         I'm so sorry.

917
01:15:58,186 --> 01:15:59,654
I shouldn't have moved out.

918
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,023
    I shouldn't have let you
 think that I didn't need you.

919
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:03,558
   Because I need you, Paul.

920
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,792
        Adam needs you.

921
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,397
     These people need you.

922
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:32,687
- Mom!
- Adam!

923
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:37,491
             Boss!

924
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,032
Boss!

925
01:16:51,074 --> 01:16:52,807
It's okay, here, come on.

926
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:53,941
       Come on, come on.

927
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:56,210
    I gotcha. Stay with--

928
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,115
     Everyone away from the
     windows and the door.

929
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,217
Just stay calm.

930
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:04,986
Stay calm, everybody.

931
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,397
   You think it's gonna hold?

932
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:19,367
          No, I don't.

933
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,037
        The basement...

934
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,805
        It was a shelter
       in the 60s, right?

935
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:25,840
   Yeah, but it's jam packed.

936
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:27,008
  I don't think we'll all fit.

937
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:28,409
     It's gonna have to do.

938
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:29,844
            Come on!
 Everyone downstairs, let's go.

939
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,746
           Let's go!

940
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,248
Come on,
    now, let's go, quickly.

941
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:38,686
        Go, go, go. Go.

942
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:45,860
- Watch your step.

943
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:51,999
Come on, guys. Quick!

944
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,514
 Donny, get these rifles ready.

945
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:08,015
    Lock and guard the door.

946
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:08,916
Wait, wait,
What's going on?

947
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:09,950
where are you going?

948
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:16,123
       Those doors aren't
    gonna hold much longer.

949
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,425
           Don't go.

950
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:19,560
      It's gonna be okay,
   the doors are gonna hold.

951
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:21,128
          I love you.

952
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,097
        I love you, too.

953
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:31,372
 Buddy, come on, give me a hug.

954
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:32,940
    Where's my hug? Come on.

955
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:38,946
      Where are you going?

956
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,616
    I gotta take care of you
   and your mommy, all right?

957
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:44,485
  But you gotta do me a favor.

958
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:47,722
       You look after her
        while I'm gone.

959
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:54,729
Okay.

960
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:55,963
     I'm going up with you.

961
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,065
   That's what I'm here for.

962
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,167
        Donny, someone's
      gotta stay down here

963
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:01,435
   and protect these people.

964
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:04,004
 Earl and I'll do it, Sheriff.

965
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,307
Your deputy's right.

966
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:07,708
    You going up there alone

967
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,809
 isn't doing anybody any good.

968
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:11,412
        We'll hold here.

969
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,447
        I won't take my
    gun off that door.

970
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:15,483
--Come on.

971
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:21,622
      You hold that door.

972
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:23,791
           Yes, sir.

973
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,113
          Stay close.

974
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,784
- It stopped banging.

975
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,957
- Come on.

976
01:20:14,677 --> 01:20:15,876
It's inside.

977
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,449
        This is the only
      way out of the hall.

978
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,619
       Stay here in case
       it gets around me.

979
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,488
         Are you sure?

980
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,793
       Just don't let it
      leave this hallway.

981
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,130
             'Kay.

982
01:23:48,657 --> 01:23:50,758
It's okay,
 it's okay, it's gonna be fine.

983
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,924
- Donny!
<i>-  Boss!</i>

984
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:27,327
            In here.

985
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:32,132
- What happened?

986
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,069
          It is fast,
      I didn't even see...

987
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,404
         You all right?

988
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,239
     I shot it. It's hurt.

989
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:42,509
Go get it.

990
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,479
    Go get it, I'll be fine.

991
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:47,514
         You need to go
      protect the people.

992
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:49,650
              Go!

993
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,488
<i> It's me,</i>
   <i> open up. Open the door.</i>

994
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:50,724
          <i> It's safe.</i>

995
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,431
- Dad!

996
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,200
Oh, he's okay!

997
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:03,236
You okay?
             -Yeah.

998
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:15,882
  Everything's gonna be fine.

999
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,346
It's over, now.

1000
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:23,750
          What is it?

1001
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:29,022
I shot it
        in the shoulder.

1002
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:32,359
I took a whole chunk out of it.

1
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:21,684
Hello.

2
00:00:23,168 --> 00:00:25,248
My name is William.

3
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:30,482
Did they tell you what happened?

4
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:32,748
My Mom and Daddy died.

5
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:34,524
That's right.

6
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:37,046
Does that bother you?

7
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:39,837
People die all the time.

8
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:44,025
That's a good way to look at it.

9
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:58,305
Do you know what that is?

10
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:01,257
Can you do it?

11
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,506
Wonderful.

12
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:31,937
Veronica.

13
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:36,929
Can you remember the
first house you ever lived in?

14
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:39,587
Close your eyes.

15
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,627
I want you to take me there.

16
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:46,771
Can you picture the
outside of the house?

17
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:51,074
Picture going to the front door.

18
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:54,378
How many steps is it from
there to your bedroom?

19
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,202
17.

20
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:02,121
Stay there for me.

21
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:06,435
How many steps is it from
your bed to your bathroom?

22
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,207
6.

23
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:12,003
Okay.

24
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:14,802
Keep your eyes closed.

25
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:18,659
Are you standing in your
bathroom right now?

26
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:22,249
What do you see?

27
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,244
Toothbrush.

28
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,901
- What color is it?
- Green.

29
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:31,873
- Anything else?
- Toothpaste with baking soda peroxide whitening.

30
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:34,058
And?

31
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:39,393
A mirror, a hairbrush, floss, a
blue towel and a yellow bath mat.

32
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,291
That's enough.

33
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:50,049
You can open your eyes now.

34
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:53,506
How did I do?

35
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,591
Well, you were perfect.

36
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,489
Veronica, would you
like to come with me?

37
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:05,172
Where?

38
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,572
To a place where I would teach you things.
You like learning things, don't you?

39
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:10,873
What kind of things?

40
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:14,386
I would be training you
for a very important job.

41
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,076
What kind of job?

42
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:18,444
That kind most people can't handle.

43
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:21,395
You have to be
very special to do it.

44
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,313
How did you get your job?

45
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:26,636
- Well, I volunteered.
- Why?

46
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,333
Because a very bad man

47
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:33,100
killed my wife
and my daughter.

48
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,610
Can I have ice cream?

49
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,626
You can have
all you can eat.

50
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:46,214
12 Years Later

51
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,991
Keep standing there.

52
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,298
You need to know what it's like
to not be able to feel your feet.

53
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:28,739
You will be chasing these boys
through the woods

54
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:31,501
in the middle of the night
with no shoes on.

55
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:33,557
Cold and wet.

56
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:39,270
You must avoid the water.

57
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,757
If you get into
a fight in the water,

58
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,319
doesn't matter how tough you are.

59
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,559
Why can't I just shoot them?

60
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,461
You want to shoot them?

61
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:52,287
Yeah.
It seems easier.

62
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,525
Yeah, okay.

63
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,462
Shoot me.

64
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:09,088
I'm not going to shoot you.

65
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:11,730
Come on, shoot me.

66
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,972
Are you scared?

67
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,010
I don't want to kill you.

68
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,824
Then wound me.

69
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:24,558
That's an order.

70
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:40,689
You see, the problem with guns are

71
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:44,373
you run out of bullets.

72
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:46,497
- Whoa!
- What are you gonna do?

73
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:49,105
I got all this.
What do you got?

74
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,694
You know what a gun
is without bullets?

75
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:53,917
It's just a paper weight.

76
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,613
Come on.

77
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:11,123
No, I'm good.

78
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,655
It's 8 miles back to the car.

79
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:27,813
If you run,
you might it back before dark.

80
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,739
- Who's that girl?
- Ah. It's the new waitress.

81
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:08,580
Her name is Gwen.

82
00:07:11,152 --> 00:07:12,403
She's not bad.

83
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:14,861
And a blonde.

84
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:21,127
What's his obsession with blondes?

85
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:26,127
It's just his type.

86
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,429
What'd I missed?

87
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,781
As human beings,
we are free.

88
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:52,843
Free to love, to hate,
to fight.

89
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,724
To kill.

90
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:59,136
This freedom is found in
every living person on this planet.

91
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:02,113
There is no one person
more powerful than the other.

92
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:05,818
Only the one with the
most will is the strongest.

93
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:08,972
Height, weight, physical appearance.

94
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:11,099
None of these things matter.

95
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,394
The only thing that matters
is your mind.

96
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,505
The question then becomes.

97
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,887
Are you the type of person who
can summon their power at will?

98
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,332
This is a ranger choke hold.
You will lose consciousness in 20 seconds.

99
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:30,419
Defend yourself.

100
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:32,867
Defend yourself!

101
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,320
What did you do wrong?

102
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:45,300
Didn't-Didn't defended myself.

103
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,805
No. Once that happens,
it's too late to defend yourself.

104
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,496
Stand up.

105
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:51,867
Move.

106
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,316
Now.

107
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:57,353
Choke me.

108
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:03,902
- How hard?
- As hard as you can.

109
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:06,615
Once you get a hold of me,
do not let go, not for a second,

110
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,907
until you feel the life
leave my body.

111
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:10,230
Go.

112
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:12,872
Harder.

113
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,728
William?
William?

114
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:37,024
Hey hey hey.
William!

115
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,816
Oh.
Thank god.

116
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,691
That was perfect.

117
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:55,685
These boys know how to fight.
And they know how to kill.

118
00:09:57,314 --> 00:10:01,215
They will be bigger than you.
They will outnumber you.

119
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,176
They will be armed.

120
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,278
They will know the terrain
and you will not.

121
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,890
You must to smarter than them.
And faster.

122
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:10,989
And when the moment comes,
you must not hesitate.

123
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:14,450
I want you to look them
in the eyes, Veronica.

124
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:17,190
Make your face

125
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,006
the last thing they see.

126
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,725
16 and a half.

127
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,281
Yeah!

128
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,197
Are you ready?

129
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:33,860
For what?

130
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,529
The time of your life.

131
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:39,508
Let's go.

132
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:49,374
So, who is it going to be?

133
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:53,565
Brown sweater at the
corner of the bar.

134
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,825
Hello.

135
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,749
- How are you doing?
- I'm well, are you?

136
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:21,666
I'm alright. Could you show me
where the restroom is?

137
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:46,480
- You like it rough?
- You have no idea.

138
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,483
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

139
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,263
You need to get some
control over yourself.

140
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:13,842
- What did I end up on the...
- On the floor?

141
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,373
You followed my girlfriend here
into the bathroom.

142
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:18,368
You tried to kiss her
and she fought you off.

143
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:20,154
And you fell.

144
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:23,810
Sorry.

145
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,990
Nooo!

146
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,166
My head hurts.
Can I take an aspirin or something?

147
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,661
No.

148
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,962
Can I lay down next to you?

149
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:02,810
You have your own bed.

150
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,023
I know but I'm cold.

151
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,365
There.

152
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:30,507
- Is that better?
- Much.

153
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:35,867
We can't do this.

154
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:40,512
- But, you're my trainer.
- That's right.

155
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:42,723
So train me.

156
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,759
Don't you find me attractive?

157
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:52,866
Who wouldn't?

158
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:55,093
So?

159
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,727
No.

160
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:00,642
Fine.

161
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:22,829
What's that?

162
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,964
It's my own little chaos cocktail.

163
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:30,121
It's 1 part sodium pentothal.

164
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,197
Truth serum.

165
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,417
What else?

166
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:37,545
1 part DMT.

167
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,408
Dimethyltryptamine.

168
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,215
Very good.

169
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:45,226
Isn't that the shit that makes
LSD look like kool-aid?

170
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:49,520
What will this do to me?

171
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:55,072
You will come face to face
with your greatest deepest fears.

172
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:57,757
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Oh really?

173
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:00,286
That would make you...
not human.

174
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:02,195
And um.

175
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,697
- I think you're...
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

176
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:06,151
- Oh yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

177
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:08,230
Well look.
You are human.

178
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:13,895
- How long does it last?
- This dose, about an hour.

179
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,293
But it will feel more
like a day to you.

180
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:26,761
In about half hour, you are going to
start to feel superhuman.

181
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,597
Is this for my protection
or yours?

182
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,008
My.

183
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:34,997
You will see the truth.

184
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:14,619
William?

185
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:17,467
Ever since I met you
I knew this day would come.

186
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,903
What are you talking about?

187
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:23,336
You failed, Veronica.

188
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:24,712
What?

189
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,281
You will not make it.

190
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:31,377
All these years, all the money,
resources spent

191
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,221
wasted.

192
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,098
What can I do?

193
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:37,892
Nothing.
It's too late.

194
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,770
- No. Please William, don't do this.
- I have no choice.

195
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:42,528
Just let me go!

196
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:44,357
I wish I could.

197
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:46,150
Good bye, Veronica.

198
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,410
But I love you.

199
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,697
Where did you go?

200
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:15,353
A man was attacking me.

201
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:17,098
You shot him and then...

202
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:21,185
I was here
on the table.

203
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,958
Then I woke up.

204
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,304
I failed the program.

205
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:28,276
- Then...
- Then what?

206
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,047
And then you killed me.

207
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:35,377
Would you really?
If you had to?

208
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,926
You know the answer.

209
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:45,486
Don't make me say it.

210
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:51,671
I gave this to you for 2 reasons.
What are they?

211
00:19:51,696 --> 00:19:54,036
To know how scared
I am of you?

212
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,421
No.

213
00:19:56,746 --> 00:20:01,102
You have to remain sharp and focused
at all times under any condition.

214
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:05,104
You have to know
how to fight

215
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:09,442
when you are tired, cold,
hot, sleep deprived

216
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:10,576
and hallucinating.

217
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:13,380
You are now ready
for the final test, Veronica.

218
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:18,134
I wanted you to know how it would feel if your
opponent has had this cocktail and you hadn't.

219
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:22,743
When am I ever going to be
facing someone who is on this shit?

220
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,469
How many?

221
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:40,766
How many what?

222
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:43,675
How many girls have they killed?

223
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,077
10.
Maybe a dozen.

224
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:51,057
And another local girl, Gwen Thomas,
went missing a few days ago.

225
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:58,679
One of them has a girlfriend.

226
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:05,387
Why does that surprise you?

227
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:10,228
They just don't seem to like women.

228
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:13,131
They don't like anybody, really.

229
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,421
They're incapable of empathy.

230
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:17,374
But they can fake it.

231
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:19,788
A girlfriend is a perfect cover.

232
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:22,415
I think she smelled it on them?

233
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,728
- Love is also base on deception.
- Yeah.

234
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:30,064
Tells her he loves her and buys
her lunch every once in a while.

235
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:34,320
It's different with her.
The other girls are just trophies.

236
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,885
They've been together
since they were 14.

237
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:42,110
Some marriages don't last that long.

238
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:45,723
My didn't.

239
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:05,933
Where are you going?

240
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,239
The fact finding mission.

241
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:10,826
With french fries.

242
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:20,584
Is this seat taken?

243
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:23,370
Hel-Help yourself.

244
00:22:27,855 --> 00:22:29,742
How are the shakes here?

245
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,471
They are delicious.

246
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:36,054
Vanilla or chocolate?

247
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:38,505
I'm a vanilla girl.

248
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,757
You should give yourself more credit.

249
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:46,826
Hi. 2 vanilla shakes please
and a large fry to go.

250
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:48,433
Thanks.

251
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,146
Do you often have
milkshakes with strangers?

252
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:55,983
Actually no, but I saw you in here
and I figure, why not.

253
00:22:56,008 --> 00:23:00,376
'Cos I didn't have anyone to talk to,
and you didn't look like you did either.

254
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:02,824
Unless I'm interrupting something?

255
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,172
No.

256
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,597
Not at all.

257
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,732
Thanks.

258
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:20,383
You know. It maybe
none of my business, but.

259
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:22,581
You look a little sad.

260
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:24,777
I'm fine, really.

261
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,871
You know this little new law

262
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:34,587
that it's a crime to be sad
while having a milkshake.

263
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,365
- You know that.
- Yeah.

264
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,351
I don't-I wouldn't want to break
any obscure milkshake laws.

265
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:48,995
Would this milkshake proves
sadness be in anyway

266
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,911
boy related?

267
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,571
I am a 17 year old girl.

268
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:55,418
Of course it's boy related.

269
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:58,504
- Tell my about it.
- No, you don't want to hear about that.

270
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:01,706
No, I do.
Really. I'm all ears.

271
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:13,611
- You know it's a torture.
- What?

272
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:20,162
Knowing you could love someone
if they just let you.

273
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:25,072
Sometimes I feel like such a fool.

274
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,844
Why is that?

275
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,065
He's just so...

276
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,209
unavailable.

277
00:24:39,654 --> 00:24:43,588
Sometimes I wonder if my boyfriend
loves me or his friends more.

278
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:46,427
What are they like?

279
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,952
Like...

280
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:51,057
Like a pack of wolves.

281
00:24:51,082 --> 00:24:54,759
One mistake away from
tearing each other to shreds.

282
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:02,777
Do you ever wished
you could just take off?

283
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,201
You know.

284
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:07,710
Leaving behind everything
and everyone you ever knew?

285
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:10,493
Yeah, once or twice.

286
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:12,578
If I went...

287
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:16,176
- I'd never come back.
- Then what's stopping you?

288
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,920
- You know what it is?
- Him.

289
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:22,256
No.

290
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,743
It's you.

291
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,989
Thanks.

292
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:33,728
Here.
Keep the change.

293
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,032
Look. I'm...
really not big on rules,

294
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:42,459
but I do have one.

295
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:44,242
What's that?

296
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:48,618
Live today like you're
going to die tomorrow.

297
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:52,062
Things just work out
a lot better that way.

298
00:25:57,732 --> 00:26:00,066
Well.
It was lovely to meet you.

299
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,564
Hey!

300
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:06,484
Thank you.

301
00:26:07,074 --> 00:26:08,592
Really!

302
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:13,016
It's just a shake.

303
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,321
Well?

304
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:32,093
Well, that place makes
a damn good shake.

305
00:26:34,518 --> 00:26:37,755
I meant what did you find out
new about your targets?

306
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:40,750
They’re falling apart.

307
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,947
I'm going to enjoy this.

308
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:50,827
When do we get started?

309
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,278
It's not like that this time.

310
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:58,218
You're going to have to
do this mission alone.

311
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:21,784
Is this seat taken?

312
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:25,333
Just by you.

313
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:33,379
My god.
You're beautiful.

314
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:36,563
How is it that I haven't
seen you before?

315
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,599
Maybe because I just
moved to town.

316
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,258
Is that right?

317
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:43,838
- Did you know anybody?
- Just you.

318
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:47,227
And the lady who
brought me my shake.

319
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:50,325
- She's a bitch.
- Is she?

320
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:54,578
But it looks delicious.

321
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:20,721
- Up to your standards?
- I've had better.

322
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:24,272
Well, please.
I love to know where.

323
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:26,684
What are you doing Saturday night?

324
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:29,067
- Washing my hair.
- No. You're doing that Friday night.

325
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:30,401
Oh, am I?

326
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:33,807
Saturday night, you're gonna
meet me here at 8 o'clock.

327
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:37,040
With... clean hair

328
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:40,433
and red lipstick.

329
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,997
And where exactly are we going

330
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,432
that I need to have

331
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:47,735
clean hair and red lipstick?

332
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:49,923
You promise not to tell anybody?

333
00:28:50,154 --> 00:28:51,505
Maybe.

334
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,438
We're going to another world.

335
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:54,990
Good.

336
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:58,932
'Cause I'm very bored of this one.

337
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:01,417
Me too.

338
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:08,964
Don't be late.

339
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:54,589
Here.

340
00:29:58,286 --> 00:30:00,515
What do you guys
do out there?

341
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:03,818
Nothing special.

342
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:05,871
Dressed like that?

343
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:07,389
We hunt.

344
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:12,982
How do I look?

345
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:16,041
Incredible.

346
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:27,729
I love you.

347
00:30:47,688 --> 00:30:51,406
- Jenny giving you shit?
- Yeah, like always.

348
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:55,260
Story of your life.

349
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,933
Did you get enough steak,
my darling?

350
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:04,179
I did Mama.
It's was wonderful.

351
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:08,022
- I'm so glad.
- Well, you're such a good cook.

352
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,108
I bet Dad misses your food.

353
00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:15,706
I sure it's better than what
they served in the mess hall.

354
00:31:18,218 --> 00:31:20,353
Are the boys picking you up?

355
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:23,822
Any minute now.

356
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,655
Do you have time for ice cream?

357
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:29,347
There's always time
for ice cream.

358
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:45,731
Damn.

359
00:31:46,413 --> 00:31:48,879
Sorry.
I was enjoying this.

360
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:52,436
You know the best part
about an ice cream cone?

361
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:54,021
What's that?

362
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:56,055
You can take it any where.

363
00:32:10,604 --> 00:32:12,606
Your Mom not coming?

364
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,408
Woo-hoo!

365
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,163
Mm. Who's this beautiful
broad piece of tits now

366
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:15,615
you got hooked up for
us this time, man?

367
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:18,335
Huh?
She prettier than the last time?

368
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:21,817
Well. I know how
you like surprises, Danny.

369
00:33:21,842 --> 00:33:23,823
Just got to wait and see.

370
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:26,731
Let's go hunting, boys.

371
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,593
I Love
You

372
00:33:56,585 --> 00:33:58,144
Are you ready?

373
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,296
If I'll ever be.

374
00:34:20,317 --> 00:34:21,816
Boys.

375
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:25,463
Are you guys an
a cappella group?

376
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:29,968
- Something like that.
- No, we don't sing together.

377
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:31,590
You should.

378
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,026
This is Shane,

379
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:37,476
Daniel,
or Danny boy.

380
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:40,229
- Nelson.
- Hello boys.

381
00:34:40,254 --> 00:34:41,798
I'm Veronica.

382
00:34:41,823 --> 00:34:43,548
Veronica,

383
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:47,025
- Do your eyes hurt?
- No.

384
00:34:47,382 --> 00:34:49,713
Because they are killing me.

385
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:52,998
Now, no sense letting a
pretty girl like this get wet.

386
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:55,931
Come on. Let's get you Veronica.
Right here inside this car.

387
00:34:55,956 --> 00:34:57,370
Here you go, sweetheart.

388
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,270
Just sit right there.
Make yourself comfortable.

389
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:01,390
Watch your head.
Okay.

390
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,831
What. You trying to creep
her out before we get there?

391
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:09,153
Cool it, man.

392
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:31,400
So, where are we going?

393
00:35:31,471 --> 00:35:33,579
I already told you.

394
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:38,026
- To another world.
- Will there be other girls there?

395
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:41,260
Lots.

396
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,957
Please introduce me.

397
00:35:43,982 --> 00:35:47,715
You're gonna love my friend, Annabelle.
She is to die for.

398
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,202
Ha ha.

399
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:50,715
I can't wait to meet her.

400
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,593
She's great but she can
get under your skin.

401
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:55,237
Yeah.
She can be edgy at times.

402
00:35:55,537 --> 00:35:58,497
She's straight to the point, sharp.

403
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:01,516
Veronica is new in town.
She doesn't know anybody.

404
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:02,936
So you boys play nice.

405
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,884
Hey Veronica.
You ever played baseball?

406
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:08,096
Softball.
Years ago though.

407
00:36:08,121 --> 00:36:10,592
So you know how
to hold a bat then?

408
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:12,680
Not very well,
but yes.

409
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:15,041
Just remember to line up
your knuckles and choke up.

410
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:17,077
Alright, batters up.

411
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:18,410
Woo!

412
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:21,391
Swing bada bada swing that.

413
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,755
You get it.
You get it, son.

414
00:36:25,365 --> 00:36:28,757
Whoa-ho-ho
Yeah!

415
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,380
Woo-hoo!

416
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:33,116
Get that shit.
Get that shit. Get it.

417
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,267
Impressive.

418
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,392
Alright, boys.
Who's next?

419
00:36:45,212 --> 00:36:48,798
So, what do you think?
Can she handle it?

420
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:52,799
I don't know.
Can you?

421
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:02,163
Alright, you ready?

422
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:04,540
Here we go!

423
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,667
- Oh.
- Strike 1.

424
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:07,816
I wasn't ready.

425
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:11,963
Try it again, base is load! Let's do it.
Let's do it this time, sweetheart!

426
00:37:11,988 --> 00:37:13,799
One more try.

427
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:16,343
Alright, right there.
Hold on tight.

428
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,855
Go go go... Ready?
1, 2, 3.

429
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,343
Swing!

430
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:22,931
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Ha-ha-ha.

431
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:25,001
Well played, sweetheart!
Well played!

432
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:27,070
Some lucky bench is
going over the letter!

433
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:28,897
Or a baseball.

434
00:37:28,922 --> 00:37:30,982
But, you're right.

435
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:34,746
The letter, that makes more sense.
See. it was a mailbox!

436
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:39,977
I'm impressed.

437
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:41,921
Thank you.

438
00:37:41,946 --> 00:37:44,579
What's the verdict, boys?
Huh?

439
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:45,956
One hell of a woman.

440
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:48,720
She can swing a bat,
that's for sure.

441
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:52,267
Yeah. I guess we keep
her around a little longer.

442
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,282
I suppose.

443
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:56,753
Thank you.

444
00:37:58,305 --> 00:38:00,029
Are we almost there?

445
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,511
Just about.

446
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:07,276
I hope it's worth the wait.

447
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:10,442
It will be.

448
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:13,157
Trust me.

449
00:38:44,794 --> 00:38:47,117
Are we the first ones here?

450
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,776
We always are.

451
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,555
I'm a little under dress.
I mean it's

452
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,428
pretty cold outside.

453
00:38:54,453 --> 00:38:56,238
You're perfect.

454
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:58,254
Come on!

455
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,700
Wow!

456
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:02,665
Veronica.

457
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:06,353
Veronica!

458
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,181
Ha.
Relax.

459
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:34,096
You'll love it here.

460
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:41,363
You sit right there.

461
00:40:05,245 --> 00:40:07,147
So, what now?

462
00:40:07,692 --> 00:40:09,328
What do you mean?

463
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:13,188
What do you guys
normally do out here?

464
00:40:14,337 --> 00:40:16,016
We talk,

465
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,270
tell stories,
play games.

466
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:21,112
Veronica.

467
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:25,296
- Wouldn't you, like to play a game?
- Absolutely.

468
00:40:25,765 --> 00:40:29,416
But first,
does anyone want a drink?

469
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:52,538
So.
Are you ready for a game?

470
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:55,785
- Depends on the game.
- Truth or Dare.

471
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:57,856
It's my favorite.

472
00:40:57,881 --> 00:40:59,573
Well, we play this game
a little differently.

473
00:40:59,598 --> 00:41:03,007
You pick a 'dare' out of
the bag that Daniel has.

474
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:06,885
You choose truth
or you do the dare.

475
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:10,550
But if you pick the same 'dare'
twice, you have to do it.

476
00:41:10,575 --> 00:41:12,051
Okay.

477
00:41:19,415 --> 00:41:20,925
Truth.

478
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:24,655
The worst thing
you've ever done.

479
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:40,440
First time I went hunting.

480
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:43,693
- What were you after?
- Rabbits.

481
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:46,976
I was 10 when my Dad
gave me my first .22.

482
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,455
It was a big deal.

483
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,931
Our first hunt together.

484
00:41:53,603 --> 00:41:57,032
I was already a pretty good shot,
so when I saw the rabbit, I nailed it.

485
00:41:59,062 --> 00:42:01,839
But I hadn't quite
finished the job.

486
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,090
I hit it in
it's hindquarters,

487
00:42:05,115 --> 00:42:09,146
so it was limping
and it kept going.

488
00:42:11,246 --> 00:42:13,376
So, my Dad

489
00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:15,646
pulls out his buck knife,

490
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,908
tells me to go
finish the job.

491
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:24,010
I must have followed that thing
a quarter mile before I found it.

492
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:26,072
He looked up at me,

493
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:34,097
and I made the stupid mistake
of looking back in his eyes.

494
00:42:36,391 --> 00:42:38,085
I couldn't do it.

495
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:42,293
Put my Dad's knife
back in my pocket,

496
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:44,501
I went and left him there.

497
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:47,788
Told my Dad I lost the rabbit in the
woods and I wanted to go home.

498
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:49,642
What did he say?

499
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:54,667
Never come home empty-handed.

500
00:42:57,319 --> 00:42:59,068
I don't know.

501
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,929
- That's the worst thing you've ever done?
- Yeah. I am with Veronica on that one.

502
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:06,526
The rabbit either died of starvation,

503
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:09,696
or some
nasty infection,

504
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,573
or was eaten by a wolf.

505
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:15,827
Because I wasn't man enough
to finish what I started.

506
00:43:16,436 --> 00:43:19,117
That creature suffered needlessly.

507
00:43:21,858 --> 00:43:25,464
Just because you kill something
doesn't mean it has to suffer.

508
00:43:30,387 --> 00:43:31,890
Your turn.

509
00:43:41,711 --> 00:43:43,248
Truth.

510
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,928
The worst thing you’ve done.

511
00:43:48,952 --> 00:43:52,435
I once had the chance
to save someone's life,

512
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:55,601
and I didn't.

513
00:43:56,087 --> 00:43:58,522
Details.

514
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:01,684
Then drink.

515
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:28,206
- So?
- I'm not drinking out the truth.

516
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:30,072
Then read your dare.

517
00:44:30,755 --> 00:44:32,595
Kill something.

518
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:39,607
That's easy.

519
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:50,813
Oh.
Do you really have to?

520
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:55,318
A dare is a dare.

521
00:44:57,804 --> 00:44:59,297
Oh.

522
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:01,560
Yummy.

523
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:05,748
That guy! That guy, man.
This guy right here!

524
00:45:05,773 --> 00:45:08,711
God damn.
Did you see that?

525
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:10,665
Delicious.

526
00:45:10,964 --> 00:45:12,360
Oh.

527
00:45:12,385 --> 00:45:14,466
Are you religious, Veronica?

528
00:45:15,096 --> 00:45:16,547
No.

529
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:19,493
I asked a lot of
people that question.

530
00:45:19,893 --> 00:45:21,870
Some say,
"Yes, very."

531
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:24,588
Others, like you, say
"No."

532
00:45:24,647 --> 00:45:26,630
Of the people in your group,

533
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,960
I would bet anything that

534
00:45:28,985 --> 00:45:30,981
when death is coming,

535
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:34,174
and their final
moments of life were

536
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:36,118
evaporating,

537
00:45:37,744 --> 00:45:40,430
every last one of them
will ask God to help.

538
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:44,663
Then I'll probably disappoint you.

539
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:51,378
Have you ever heard of...
Pisaruk,

540
00:45:51,403 --> 00:45:52,984
Veronica?

541
00:45:53,009 --> 00:45:54,767
No.

542
00:45:55,178 --> 00:46:00,119
He's a-He's a 16th century
political satirist.

543
00:46:00,144 --> 00:46:01,927
And he said

544
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:04,803
that you could never

545
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,654
truly experience pleasure

546
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:12,083
without going through pain.

547
00:46:13,655 --> 00:46:15,798
Could you please.

548
00:46:15,823 --> 00:46:17,318
Hit me.

549
00:46:21,565 --> 00:46:24,169
- Ha!
- Come on, baby!

550
00:46:24,194 --> 00:46:27,106
You got to do a little
better than that!

551
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:31,044
Blackjack.

552
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:35,483
Woo!
Heh!

553
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:39,642
So. When do the
other girls get here?

554
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:41,681
I've already told you.

555
00:46:42,225 --> 00:46:44,109
Is something wrong?

556
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:48,216
No. I just don't like
to be outnumbered.

557
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,292
Oh, don't worry. You will be in
good company soon enough, honey.

558
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:54,283
We're having fun, aren't we?

559
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:56,664
Yeah.

560
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,234
Kiss someone.

561
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:09,922
Don't look at me.

562
00:47:09,947 --> 00:47:12,814
Please. I'm not
that type of a girl.

563
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:15,567
Rules are rules.

564
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,142
Your turn.

565
00:47:56,382 --> 00:47:57,977
Truth or dare?

566
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:02,307
It's the second time
I drew this.

567
00:48:02,472 --> 00:48:05,221
Well. In that case,
you have to do the dare.

568
00:48:06,434 --> 00:48:09,466
- Nelson, your belt.
- Why does it have to be my?

569
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:29,661
Oh, I've had Manhattan
and I've had Old Fashioneds

570
00:48:29,686 --> 00:48:34,125
but these are some strong
libations you brought, Veronica.

571
00:48:34,629 --> 00:48:36,933
Nothing but the best.

572
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:46,704
So many choices.

573
00:48:49,268 --> 00:48:50,453
Truth.

574
00:48:50,478 --> 00:48:53,735
Again?
You're so honest.

575
00:48:55,441 --> 00:48:57,375
I bet I can get
you to drink.

576
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,999
Try me.

577
00:48:59,028 --> 00:49:01,472
What happened to Gwen Thomas?

578
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:04,717
I don't know the girl.

579
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:06,010
Did you?

580
00:49:06,035 --> 00:49:07,261
Not in the least.

581
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:09,222
I was so sad when
she went missing.

582
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:11,279
Didn't she go to your school?

583
00:49:15,002 --> 00:49:15,937
Your turn.

584
00:49:15,962 --> 00:49:19,293
- Don't you have to drink?
- I spoke the truth.

585
00:49:19,882 --> 00:49:22,120
I've no idea
what happened to her.

586
00:49:22,343 --> 00:49:23,569
Your turn.

587
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:24,737
I just went.

588
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,441
I'm out.

589
00:49:26,848 --> 00:49:29,534
- Me too.
- Me too.

590
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:31,372
Oh.
A little help?

591
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:50,430
- I'd like to go home.
- No.

592
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:53,333
- Can you just take me home?
- No, we just got here.

593
00:49:54,584 --> 00:49:56,004
I don't care.

594
00:49:56,029 --> 00:49:57,979
Why.
Is this game not fun?

595
00:49:58,004 --> 00:49:59,907
Okay, we'll play a new one.

596
00:50:01,674 --> 00:50:03,443
I know what you're thinking.

597
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:05,244
Don't worry about that.
Women don't run very well

598
00:50:05,276 --> 00:50:07,759
after a sexual assault.

599
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:10,156
And I want you to run, Veronica.

600
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:14,311
You have 5 minutes.

601
00:50:17,273 --> 00:50:19,126
And then what?

602
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:22,028
We...

603
00:50:22,431 --> 00:50:24,182
hunt you down.

604
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,265
Help!
Help me! Help me!

605
00:50:28,304 --> 00:50:30,052
Aww!

606
00:50:30,077 --> 00:50:33,431
Oh no!
Please god, save me!

607
00:50:33,456 --> 00:50:35,162
Is anybody going to save me?

608
00:50:35,187 --> 00:50:36,889
Aww!

609
00:50:36,914 --> 00:50:40,044
- Danny, stop!
- Please, help!

610
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:41,420
Can anyone save me.

611
00:50:41,445 --> 00:50:43,836
We're in the woods.
Nobody can hear you.

612
00:50:43,861 --> 00:50:46,030
Scream all you want.

613
00:50:53,248 --> 00:50:55,870
Please.
Please, this isn't funny.

614
00:50:55,895 --> 00:50:57,632
Oh.
It will be.

615
00:50:57,657 --> 00:51:00,464
When you're begging
for your life.

616
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:03,446
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Eh ha ha...

617
00:51:03,611 --> 00:51:06,867
Alright, boys.
Shut your eyes until I say so.

618
00:51:09,994 --> 00:51:11,893
Now, Veronica.

619
00:51:11,994 --> 00:51:15,786
What's 360 degrees divided by 4?

620
00:51:16,164 --> 00:51:18,600
- 90.
- 90.

621
00:51:18,626 --> 00:51:20,586
Unless I know which
direction you go,

622
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:23,856
which means each of us will have
90 degrees of ground to cover.

623
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:25,811
The further you go,
the more land we have to track.

624
00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:28,801
Personally, I like your chances.

625
00:51:34,267 --> 00:51:36,949
But, you have to keep running.

626
00:51:38,354 --> 00:51:41,100
5 minutes.

627
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,959
Ha-ha-ha...

628
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:46,712
Run, rabbit.

629
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,269
Run!

630
00:51:50,634 --> 00:51:52,482
Ha-ha-ha...

631
00:51:57,498 --> 00:51:59,384
We give her what?
4 more minutes?

632
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,570
Aww!

633
00:52:01,595 --> 00:52:03,213
Woo.
Someone's a little handsy.

634
00:52:03,238 --> 00:52:05,063
If he's not waiting, I'm not.

635
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,476
Don't forget the booze.

636
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:14,294
Let the games begin.

637
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:41,684
There is no one person
more powerful than the other.

638
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:45,633
Only the one with the
most will is the strongest.

639
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:19,715
Come on, you Babylonian whore!

640
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:34,393
You Babylonian whore!

641
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:20,792
AWWW!

642
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,401
Any luck?

643
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:58,117
I'm going this way.

644
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:53,402
Mom?

645
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:57,110
Mom?

646
00:56:59,473 --> 00:57:01,727
Mom!

647
00:57:02,077 --> 00:57:03,850
Nelson.

648
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:05,364
Mom?

649
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:06,986
Come on.

650
00:57:07,308 --> 00:57:09,669
Come on, you cowards.

651
00:57:11,812 --> 00:57:14,096
I knew this day would come.

652
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,585
I knew you would all
turn on me.

653
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:20,687
You think you are so smart.

654
00:57:21,155 --> 00:57:23,295
Well, I'm smarter.

655
00:57:24,783 --> 00:57:26,429
Come on!

656
00:57:26,952 --> 00:57:28,929
Come on, you cowards!

657
00:57:28,954 --> 00:57:30,389
Come on!

658
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:32,675
I'll fucking kill you!

659
00:57:47,389 --> 00:57:49,164
Come on!

660
00:58:03,906 --> 00:58:05,860
Show yourself!

661
00:58:10,037 --> 00:58:11,838
Where are you?

662
00:58:23,008 --> 00:58:26,195
This is it?
This is all you got?

663
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,044
Come on!

664
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:57,939
No.
Please.

665
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:01,028
Don't.

666
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:11,295
That's a really big rock.

667
00:59:11,932 --> 00:59:13,546
Nelson?

668
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:51,407
Veronica!

669
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,806
Veronica!

670
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,874
You are an interesting girl.

671
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:43,900
Jameson?

672
01:00:46,652 --> 01:00:48,351
What is this?

673
01:00:50,076 --> 01:00:51,516
Nothing.

674
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:55,480
Just a silly joke
Nelson and Danny play.

675
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:02,184
What are you doing here?

676
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:04,144
Looking for Shane.

677
01:01:04,169 --> 01:01:05,708
Have you seen him?

678
01:01:06,624 --> 01:01:09,391
- He's hunting.
- In a tuxedo?

679
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:13,375
It's important to look you best.

680
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,006
What do you guys
do out here?

681
01:01:17,612 --> 01:01:19,386
How do I look?

682
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:22,895
- Good. You look good.
- Just good?

683
01:01:23,272 --> 01:01:26,083
Come on.
You used to be better than that.

684
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:28,165
Jameson, you look great,
but I'm not- I'm not gonna...

685
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,833
But what?
You feel differently.

686
01:01:29,858 --> 01:01:31,130
Now?

687
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:32,641
Yes.

688
01:01:37,744 --> 01:01:39,016
- Do you?
- Yes.

689
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:40,980
I've moved on.

690
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:44,485
And now you're
happy with Shane?

691
01:01:45,377 --> 01:01:47,260
He's a good guy.

692
01:01:48,422 --> 01:01:50,980
But is he a good

693
01:01:51,005 --> 01:01:52,770
boyfriend?

694
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:00,701
I wouldn't make that mistake.

695
01:02:00,725 --> 01:02:02,368
You had your shot.

696
01:02:02,394 --> 01:02:04,667
- We were kids.
- We still are.

697
01:02:04,692 --> 01:02:06,338
That was years ago.
I have evolved.

698
01:02:06,363 --> 01:02:09,878
So have I.
In another direction.

699
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:14,122
Jenny.

700
01:02:16,909 --> 01:02:20,179
You're forgetting something very
important that I used to tell you.

701
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:21,567
What?

702
01:02:24,112 --> 01:02:26,455
We're all just animals.

703
01:02:28,587 --> 01:02:30,772
And we don't change.

704
01:02:55,489 --> 01:02:56,914
Jen.

705
01:02:57,824 --> 01:02:59,271
Shane.

706
01:03:00,327 --> 01:03:02,594
How could you do this?

707
01:03:02,746 --> 01:03:04,139
She's compromised.

708
01:03:04,164 --> 01:03:07,319
- I'm so sorry, I just lost...
- Shut your mouth!

709
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,561
And you!

710
01:03:09,586 --> 01:03:11,438
I grandfather you in.

711
01:03:11,463 --> 01:03:12,940
I was her first.

712
01:03:12,965 --> 01:03:14,856
- You slept with him?
- It was so long ago

713
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:17,396
I didn't even know
what we were doing.

714
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:19,438
I beg to differ.

715
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,790
I suppose I deserve that.

716
01:03:28,766 --> 01:03:30,720
Shane, stop!

717
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:35,073
- That make you feel better, buddy?
- No!

718
01:03:35,098 --> 01:03:37,079
Okay. I know I can't
control what you two did

719
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:39,174
before we started dating.

720
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:40,801
But why now?

721
01:03:40,826 --> 01:03:44,447
- To expose the truth.
- What truth?

722
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:48,669
The one you've been running from.
Shane.

723
01:03:49,883 --> 01:03:52,062
People like us cannot love.

724
01:03:52,087 --> 01:03:54,898
You've been fooling the world for so long,
you're starting to believe it.

725
01:03:54,923 --> 01:03:56,483
I do love her.

726
01:03:56,508 --> 01:03:58,251
No, you can't.

727
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,728
What does he mean
people like you?

728
01:04:00,762 --> 01:04:01,926
Nothing.

729
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:04,157
Don't listen to a word
this asshole has to say.

730
01:04:04,182 --> 01:04:06,811
- She should know, Shane.
- Know what?

731
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,787
What we do here.

732
01:04:08,812 --> 01:04:11,671
- Go home. We'll talk in the morning.
- I want to know!

733
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:13,750
It's time, Shane.

734
01:04:13,775 --> 01:04:15,168
What do you do out here?

735
01:04:15,193 --> 01:04:18,876
- We get drunk and tell stories.
- And then?

736
01:04:19,867 --> 01:04:23,166
Hunt girls like...

737
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:24,597
you.

738
01:04:27,456 --> 01:04:29,026
Shane?

739
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:30,146
He's lying.

740
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:32,356
I'm a lot of things, Jennifer,
but one thing I'm not

741
01:04:32,381 --> 01:04:34,075
is a liar.

742
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:37,421
You know Gwen Thomas?

743
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,819
- She was in my homeroom.
- Yeah.

744
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:43,155
We did her just over
the rise back there.

745
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,198
One shot,
right to the chest.

746
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:46,679
Don't.

747
01:04:46,866 --> 01:04:48,609
- Don't believe him.
- We don't always use firearms,

748
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,747
we like to mix up our techniques,
it throws off authorities.

749
01:04:51,772 --> 01:04:54,412
This is all one big
tasteless joke.

750
01:04:56,689 --> 01:04:59,421
- Shane.
- I said, go!

751
01:04:59,446 --> 01:05:01,419
Well, she's not going anywhere.

752
01:05:02,115 --> 01:05:04,179
She already knows too much.
Shane.

753
01:05:06,447 --> 01:05:07,596
No.

754
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:10,381
If you're gonna shoot her,
you'll have to shoot me.

755
01:05:11,249 --> 01:05:12,730
Fine.

756
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:45,927
I'm so

757
01:05:45,952 --> 01:05:47,577
sorry.

758
01:05:48,453 --> 01:05:50,938
Not everything
Jameson said was true.

759
01:05:50,963 --> 01:05:53,186
I do-I do love you.

760
01:05:54,628 --> 01:05:56,407
I always will.

761
01:06:02,843 --> 01:06:04,191
Shane.

762
01:08:06,111 --> 01:08:07,629
Fuck.

763
01:08:13,306 --> 01:08:15,315
Bravo!

764
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,974
Bravo.

765
01:08:30,365 --> 01:08:32,592
Relax. Relax
I'm just

766
01:08:32,617 --> 01:08:34,997
admiring your work.

767
01:08:35,603 --> 01:08:38,538
Daniel, Nelson,
now Shane.

768
01:08:38,563 --> 01:08:40,845
It's very impressive indeed.

769
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:45,738
No no no. Relax.
Catch your breath.

770
01:08:45,763 --> 01:08:49,159
Take a seat. I won't touch you
until you're ready.

771
01:09:01,813 --> 01:09:03,710
Shall we play a game?

772
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,094
You and the games.

773
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,255
So, here's how this works.

774
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,723
I ask you a question,
you answer it,

775
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:14,882
you ask me a question and
I answer it, got it?

776
01:09:15,477 --> 01:09:17,349
Yeah, I think so.

777
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:18,809
So.

778
01:09:20,081 --> 01:09:22,973
Why are my friends
tripping their balls off?

779
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:27,705
Dimethyltryptamine, mixed
with sodium pentothal.

780
01:09:31,009 --> 01:09:32,553
Okay.

781
01:09:34,078 --> 01:09:35,587
Wow.

782
01:09:37,015 --> 01:09:38,532
Your turn.

783
01:09:42,062 --> 01:09:43,522
Woo.
This is exciting.

784
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:45,717
- How many girls have you killed?
- Boring.

785
01:09:45,742 --> 01:09:49,005
You said I ask the question
and you have to answer it.

786
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:53,373
- 21 including you.
- Oh.

787
01:09:53,406 --> 01:09:54,658
Well,

788
01:09:54,683 --> 01:09:57,637
I think we're getting a little
ahead of ourselves now.

789
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:05,041
How did it feel when
you killed my friends.

790
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:11,341
- Fantastic.
- Oh god, I'm in love!

791
01:10:15,887 --> 01:10:17,912
Shane's girlfriend?

792
01:10:18,223 --> 01:10:20,126
What about her?

793
01:10:20,392 --> 01:10:21,826
Jennifer, right?

794
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:24,156
Yes.
Do you know her?

795
01:10:24,181 --> 01:10:26,773
My question.

796
01:10:29,317 --> 01:10:31,332
Have you ever slept with her?

797
01:10:32,763 --> 01:10:36,028
Indeed I have.
Many times.

798
01:10:36,282 --> 01:10:38,153
It was lovely.

799
01:10:38,465 --> 01:10:40,302
Why do you ask?

800
01:10:41,746 --> 01:10:43,687
I was just wondering.

801
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:46,871
Why do you ask?

802
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:50,168
It was his deepest darkest fear.

803
01:10:50,193 --> 01:10:51,942
Kind of a not deep.

804
01:10:52,537 --> 01:10:57,278
Most people's biggest fears are on
their surface, just waiting to pop out.

805
01:10:57,312 --> 01:11:00,168
What's waiting to pop out
of you, Jameson?

806
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:05,387
What's your deepest darkest fear?

807
01:11:06,438 --> 01:11:08,367
Have you got your breath?

808
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,281
Yes.

809
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,352
I have, thank you.

810
01:11:12,753 --> 01:11:14,274
Alright.

811
01:11:15,993 --> 01:11:19,085
My deepest darkest...

812
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:23,006
You take that well.

813
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,496
That was for my friends.

814
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:29,749
And we don't have to
keep doing this.

815
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,410
Heh-oh-oh.

816
01:11:32,005 --> 01:11:33,857
I think we do.

817
01:11:33,882 --> 01:11:35,233
Or...

818
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:37,122
We could get married?

819
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:40,564
- Yeah, I don't see that happening.
- Oh, but I do.

820
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:42,712
We'll be so happy together.

821
01:11:43,729 --> 01:11:45,102
Going town to town

822
01:11:45,127 --> 01:11:47,772
- just killing people?
- Exactly!

823
01:11:50,732 --> 01:11:52,792
So, I'm just enjoying myself.

824
01:11:52,817 --> 01:11:54,452
Alright, let's fight.

825
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:40,487
Jesus, you smell good.

826
01:13:55,648 --> 01:13:57,087
Careful!

827
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,486
You don't want to
hang yourself, do you?

828
01:14:03,368 --> 01:14:05,208
Let me down.

829
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:08,307
Now.
Why would I do that?

830
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:13,224
I'll never do this again,
I promise.

831
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:15,426
Do what exactly?

832
01:14:15,729 --> 01:14:18,023
Hunt girls.

833
01:14:18,796 --> 01:14:20,958
I highly doubt that.

834
01:14:29,978 --> 01:14:31,704
I'll give you anything you want.

835
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:35,518
You know. This is starting to
feel like a game, Jameson.

836
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:39,092
And I know how much
you love games.

837
01:14:39,901 --> 01:14:42,373
So, let's call this game

838
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:46,014
"1 question."

839
01:14:47,075 --> 01:14:51,262
Because there is only one thing
that you have that I want.

840
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:53,357
Can you guess what that is?

841
01:14:54,165 --> 01:14:55,183
Fuck.

842
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:57,043
Be careful.

843
01:14:58,396 --> 01:14:59,814
What?

844
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:04,152
I have no idea,
but name it, and it's yours.

845
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:07,389
Your life.

846
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:10,736
No.

847
01:15:11,265 --> 01:15:12,718
Please don't.

848
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:14,869
Please don't.

849
01:15:14,894 --> 01:15:18,414
Have you ever noticed how people
try to strike bargains with you,

850
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:20,874
instead of just accepting their fate?

851
01:15:21,609 --> 01:15:24,088
Are you religious, Jameson?

852
01:15:25,338 --> 01:15:26,970
No.

853
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:31,812
- Are you gonna beg God to help you?
- NO!

854
01:15:36,309 --> 01:15:39,131
- Maybe you should.
- FUCK YOU!

855
01:15:49,688 --> 01:15:51,694
Holy shit.

856
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,412
No.

857
01:15:53,725 --> 01:15:55,719
No, please stop.

858
01:15:55,744 --> 01:15:57,104
Oh!

859
01:16:00,231 --> 01:16:03,850
No-no-no...
NO!

860
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:11,509
Get away. Get away.
Get away.

861
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:13,483
Please make it stop.

862
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:20,407
Make it stop!

863
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:27,441
Stop.

864
01:16:28,676 --> 01:16:30,896
Stop-stop-stop...

865
01:16:33,445 --> 01:16:35,391
Get away.
Get away from me.

866
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:38,673
Get away from me!
Get away.

867
01:16:38,698 --> 01:16:42,350
PLEASE!
Stop it. Stop.

868
01:16:43,204 --> 01:16:45,115
STOP!

869
01:17:07,799 --> 01:17:09,499
Well done.

870
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:12,597
Thank you.

871
01:17:15,556 --> 01:17:17,195
You okay?

872
01:17:19,185 --> 01:17:20,882
Never better.

873
01:17:55,452 --> 01:17:57,525
So, how's your pancakes?

874
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:07,963
Terrible.

875
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:11,574
Mine too.

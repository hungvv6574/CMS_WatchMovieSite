00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:32,525
<i>Darling, I remember
the way you used to wait</i>

4
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:37,739
<i>It was there
that you whispered tenderly</i>

5
00:00:38,244 --> 00:00:43,244
<i>That you loved me
You'd always be</i>

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,250
Some things,

7
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:47,920
<i>once you've loved them,</i>

8
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:52,841
<i>become yours forever.</i>

9
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:55,469
<i>And if you try to let them go</i>

10
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,470
<i>they only circle back
and return to you.</i>

11
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:08,186
<i>They become part
of who you are.</i>

12
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:16,027
"Or they destroy you."

13
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:21,578
You can't show this to anyone.

14
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:22,746
Then tell the truth, Lu.

15
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:23,830
You weren't even there.

16
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:28,831
It's your truth. It's fiction.

17
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:35,463
You wanted him gone, too.
You sent him to me.

18
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:38,470
Please.
You'll kill me with that.

19
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:39,680
Allen!

20
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,017
No. Allen!

21
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:45,644
Don't. No!

22
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:49,147
Don't!

come for me?

36
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:40,532
Why? Are you
expecting something?

37
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:44,369
No. No.

38
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:54,667
I told you
it wouldn't work.

39
00:02:55,048 --> 00:03:00,048
Mom?

40
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:04,723
You gotta get me outta here.

41
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,767
He nailed the window shut
while I was in the bath.

42
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:08,477
Dad didn't do that, Mom.

43
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:10,103
I nailed the windows because
you're not right. Shh!

44
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:15,104
He can hear you.
He got wires in the walls.

45
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,695
You have to rest,
clear your head.

46
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:19,988
Do you want to go
back to Greystone?

47
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,239
You wouldn't dare
put me back there.

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,949
Mom,Mom.
Then listen to me.

49
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,950
He can hear you. Shh!

50
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:32,584
Can he still hear me?

51
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:37,585
What did I just say?

52
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:39,925
It's all right.

53
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:44,926
Quiet down.

54
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:52,308
Don't ever leave me.

55
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,459
Were you gonna tell me
that you applied?

56
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:25,341
I didn't want her to know.

57
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:40,773
"Love that is hoarded

00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:44,656

"ls what we hand away"

61
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:50,579
Have, hand. It's consonance.

62
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,457
Give, is. Assonance.

63
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,792
Hey, I wrote the goddamn poem.

64
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:58,420
All right?

65
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:03,421
Why don't you go
write your own?

66
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:10,845
Open it.

67
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:33,246
I got in.
You got in?

68
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:35,081
To Columbia University.
You got into Columbia.

69
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:38,084
Yes!

00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:47,135
<i>Grab your coat
and get your hat</i>

71
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:52,136
<i>Leave your worries

72
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:56,394
<i>Just direct your feet</i>

73
00:05:56,395 --> 00:06:01,149
<i>To the sunny side
of the street</i>

74
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,987
<i>Can't you hear
that pitter pat?</i>

75
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:10,988
<i>And that happy tune
is your step</i>

76
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:16,081
<i>Life can be so sweet</i>

77
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:19,751
<i>On the sunny side
of the street</i>

78
00:06:19,752 --> 00:06:22,754
<i>I used to walk...</i>

79
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:25,799
You don't wanna
go down there.

80
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,425
It's the land
of the fairies.

81
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:29,886
Head there,
you never come back.

82
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,930
Luke Detweiler,
Danville, Virginia.

83
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:33,765
Allen Ginsberg.

84
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,892
You're Jewish, right?

85
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:40,605
I'm getting good at telling.

86
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:43,149
The South Hall library
is a church

87
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,110
and these are the sacraments,

88
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:49,447
original folios of the most
important texts in history.

89
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:50,991
<i>Beowulf.</i>

90
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:53,618
<i>First Folio Hamlet.</i>

91
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:56,162
The Gutenberg Bible.

92
00:06:56,163 --> 00:07:00,417
These are among the university's
prized possessions.

93
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:03,879
Hands off the glass.

94
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,841
Let's hear a bit, shall we?

95
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:09,885
"On a Sunday afternoon,

96
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:11,803
"when the shutters are down

97
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:14,931
"and the proletariat

Henry Miller.

105
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:37,913
Get down immediately.

106
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:39,497
That book is restricted.

107
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:42,417
Which is why I
committed it to memory.

108
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:45,921
Security.

109
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:48,048
What the hell
are you doing?

110
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:53,049
Alert the press. Tell
them Lucien Carr is innocent

111
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:55,388
That was highly unusual.

112
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,600
Campus is
actually quite quiet.

113
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:02,228
Moving on.

114
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,774
The Victorian sonnet has the
balance of three tenets,

115
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:08,652
rhyme, meter, conceit.

116
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,696
Without this balance,
a poem becomes slack,

117
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:14,908
an untucked shirt.

118
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:17,369
Professor Steeves.

119
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,538
Then how do you
explain Whitman?

120
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,958
Say more. Two more sentences.

121
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,378
Well, uh,
he hated rhyme and meter.

122
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:30,340
The whole point was
untucking your shirt.

123
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:31,883
What's your name?

124
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,385
Allen Ginsberg.

125
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:34,844
Ginsberg?

126
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:39,845
Your father, perhaps,
is the poet Louis Ginsberg?

127
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,227
He writes with
rhyming metered verse.

128
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:45,522
Why do you think
he chose that form?

129
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:50,443
Because it's easier.

130
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:54,739
This university exists
because of tradition and form.

131
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,659
Would you rather this building
be built by engineers

132
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,329
or Whitman and his boys
at play?

133
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,582
There can be no creation

134
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:09,583
before imitation.

<i>Reports from
the front say the Nazis</i>

136
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:12,424
<i>Reports from
the front say the Nazis</i>

137
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:14,259
<i>are wheeling up fresh materiel
and reserves.</i>

138
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,468
Shut the books.

139
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:17,387
We're taking my brother
with us to the social.

140
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:19,222
He ships out tomorrow.

141
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:21,975
I can't. You see
how much I have to do.

142
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:26,938
He's Navy.
It's catnip for the skirts.

143
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:31,939
You hymies are really
all about work, huh?

144
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:26,498
Brahms?

145
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:28,833
Finally.

146
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:32,378
An oasis in this wasteland.

147
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:34,339
So how come you're
not at the social?

148
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,133
Oh, only the most antisocial
have to go

149
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:40,845
to an event
actually called one.

150
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:42,472
Libation?

151
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,015
What, you drink
in your room?

152
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:48,895
How does a horrible bottle
of Chianti sound?

153
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:51,189
I don't drink.

154
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,191
Freshman?

155
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:54,734
Yes.

156
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:56,194
Excellent,
I love first times.

157
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,863
I want my entire life
to be composed of them.

158
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:03,576
Life is only interesting
if life is wide.

159
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:07,539
To Walt Whitman.

160
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,043
You dirty bastard.

161
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:13,628
How's your Yeats?

162
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,880
Have you read <i>A</i> Vision?

163
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:17,423
Uh, never heard of it.

164
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:19,342
Oh. It's completely
brilliant.

165
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:21,261
And impossible.

166
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:25,557
He says that life is round.

167
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:30,558
That we're stuck on this wheel
of living and dying.

168
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:33,481
An endless circle.

169
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,400
Until

170
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,068
someone breaks it.

171
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:39,445
You walked in here.
You ruptured the pattern.

172
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:44,446
Bang. The whole world gets wider.
Gets wider.

173
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:47,912
How did you...
Uh, it's consonance.

174
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:51,291
A reiteration of themes.

175
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:56,292
Are you a writer?

176
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:59,591
'Cause I've got
a job for a writer.

177
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:04,592
No, I'm not.

178
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:12,766
Well, you're not anything yet.

179
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:17,901
Ginsberg.

180
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:19,611
Isn't that you?

181
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:21,487
Ginsberg!
What?

182
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:24,866
Phone call.

183
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:29,867
I'll be back.

184
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:32,081
Thank you.

185
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,626
Hello.
I found the wires.

186
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:36,294
He's trying to
get inside my head.

187
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:39,964
Dad is not trying
to get inside your head, okay?

188
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:42,634
Put him on.

189
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:46,804
He's not here. He left.

190
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:48,640
Where'd he go?

191
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:52,393
Honey,
I need you to come home now.

192
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:54,479
<i>Mom, I can't come home.</i>

193
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,814
Listen to me.

194
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:59,692
<i>You have to look
after yourself.</i>

195
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:03,154
I don't feel good.

196
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:04,614
Are you going
to the dance?

197
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:05,990
Downtown.

198
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:07,033
<i>NOW?</i>

199
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:08,117
Who are you talking to?

200
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:09,494
No one.
Is he there with you?

201
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:11,496
No, Mom, he's not here.
Um...

202
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,539
Look, I will be there
as soon as I can.

203
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,459
<i>I need you tonight.</i>

204
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,089
I need you to promise me.

205
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,925
I promise. I love you.

206
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:28,926
Bye.

207
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:39,186
Coming?

208
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:44,445
Welcome to
the edge of the world.

209
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:52,537
<i>You like my smile
You like my style</i>

210
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:54,706
<i>Well, why don't you
make me know it?</i>

211
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:57,000
<i>You like my walk
You like my talk</i>

212
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,377
<i>Well, there's
only one way to show it!</i>

213
00:13:59,378 --> 00:14:04,340
<i>If you want to shake my hand
like they do it in Harlem</i>

214
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:07,885
Allen in Wonderland.

215
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:20,148
Do you know her?

216
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,566
No, and I don't plan on it.

217
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:26,567
She tasted like imported sophistication
and domestic cigarettes.

218
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,410
Dave, where's the liquor?

219
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:36,456
I'll be right back.

220
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,588
You are pinching.

221
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:44,797
You are pinching.

222
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:48,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

223
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:53,761
You Okay?

224
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,688
What's that?

225
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:04,650
Nitrous oxide
for narco analysis.

226
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:09,651
Know thyself
and beshit thyself.

227
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:15,449
You ever done that?

228
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,961
Oh. No thanks.
I don't do the cannabis.

229
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:28,424
Show me the man
who is both sober and happy,

230
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:31,969
and I will show you
the crinkled anus

231
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,970
of a lying asshole.

232
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:42,230
Allen, Willy.
Willy, Allen.

233
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:46,317
Lucien, reefer.

234
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:47,902
Nice meeting you.

235
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:49,320
Is he a criminal?

236
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:50,988
He wishes
he were a criminal.

237
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:54,075
The Burroughs family
is richer than God.

238
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:55,159
Well, he looks
like a criminal.

239
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,285
He's a Harvard man.

240
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:58,830
He's going to be
an amazing artist.

241
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,916
His current medium
is himself.

242
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,167
What's that?

243
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:06,129
It's bunk for school.

244
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,507
Come on.
I want you to meet our host.

245
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:16,218
What we have, darlings and
demoiselles, is a circle.

246
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:20,351
Life is round.

247
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:23,062
Patterns, routines,

248
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:26,566
a wheel of self-abuse.

249
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:28,401
Margaret, don't even deny it.

250
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:29,652
He sounds like you.

251
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:33,364
Because it was me first.

252
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:37,869
Until the disruption
we long for comes along

253
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,204
and the circle is broken.

254
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:42,123
He used to be
my guardian angel,

255
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:47,124
but he said
I was too much work.

256
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:52,921
Take this unbloomed stalwart.

257
00:16:56,555 --> 00:17:00,808
And you are?

258
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:03,269
Allen.

259
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,437
Allen.

260
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:09,233
Play nice, David.

261
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:11,569
Who comes uninvited
to my apartment.

262
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:16,282
Actually, I invited him.

263
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:18,451
No one notices him.

264
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:21,787
Look at him.
Why would we bother?

265
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:26,788
So the pattern
of our lives holds.

266
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:30,421
But who knows?

267
00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:32,006
Under the right circumstances,

268
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:37,007
even he might change
the world.

269
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,980
<i>In the distance
I heard a sound</i>

270
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:56,781
<i>The sound of marching men</i>

271
00:17:56,782 --> 00:17:58,908
So you met Lucien
in the lunch line,

272
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:01,619
and now he's all
that you can see.

273
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,204
Why don't you like me?

274
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:08,205
Because David was in
the same godforsaken line.

275
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:13,877
<i>And then</i>

276
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:17,635
Some earjob at the bar
just called me kid,

277
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:21,472
so I stole his drink.

278
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:24,475
That's Ogden Nash.

279
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:26,477
Who's Ogden Nash?

280
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:28,354
The best-selling poet
in the country.

281
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:29,772
Perhaps
you've heard this one.

282
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:33,150
"The girl who is bespectacled
she may not get her nectacled

283
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:35,319
"But safety pins
and bassinets..."

284
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,863
"Await the girl
who fassinets."

285
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:40,825
And that's what he's selling?
Ugh, I'll kill him.

286
00:18:40,826 --> 00:18:45,580
Aim for the throat.

287
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:50,581
No.
We're not going to kill him.

288
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:55,836
Even better, we're going to
make sure nobody remembers him.

289
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:58,968
How many men
started the Renaissance?

290
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:00,761
Two.
And the Romantics?

291
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:04,098
More, I suspect,
than this theory accommodates.

292
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:06,559
We're sending millions
to Europe

293
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,979
to fight the fascists,
but they're here.

294
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,148
Meter and rhyme...

295
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:13,608
And Professor Steeves.

296
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:15,443
Yes!

297
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:17,445
They're all guards
in some prison.

298
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:22,446
Let's make the prisoners
come out and play.

299
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,120
Let's come up with
new words, new rhythms.

300
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,293
We need a name.

301
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:35,004
How did they
come up with "Dada"?

302
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:38,716
Tristan Tzara jabbed
a knife into a dictionary.

303
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:40,885
Shit. So that's been done.

304
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:43,387
A literary revolution
without writing a word.

305
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:44,597
Neat trick, Lu.

306
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:46,849
Well, I'm listening.

307
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,811
What about Yeats?

308
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:53,147
The New Vision.

309
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:56,609
<i>Harlem soldiers
on the ground</i>

310
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,613
Ginsy.

311
00:20:00,614 --> 00:20:02,448
You're hired.

312
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:07,449
<i>On parade</i>

313
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,258
Keep it moving,
gentlemen.

314
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,843
Stay in line.

315
00:20:22,844 --> 00:20:27,844
Fucking perverts.

316
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:32,978
"In the dawn,
armed with a burning patience

317
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:37,358
"we shall enter
the splendid city."

318
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:40,444
Shit.
It's Rimbaud.

319
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:42,780
It's overwritten, I know.
He's allowed.

320
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:44,407
No. My mother.

321
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:46,659
This is bad. This is very bad.

322
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,452
What is?

323
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:50,621
She's gonna be furious.

324
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:51,706
Don't go then.

325
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:53,249
You don't understand.
I have to.

326
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,792
Why?

327
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:58,796
It's complicated.

328
00:20:58,797 --> 00:21:00,715
Perfect.

329
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:05,716
I love complicated.

330
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:10,433
Dad? DOCTOR: Sign here.
Greystone will alert you...

331
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:14,979
What's going on?

332
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,980
Your mother needs her rest.

333
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:24,488
Ma.

334
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:26,282
You can't do this.

335
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:30,286
Mmm.

336
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:33,414
Where were you?

337
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:36,417
I was out with a friend.

338
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:39,003
I called you.
I know.

339
00:21:39,004 --> 00:21:40,504
It's time to go,
Mrs. Ginsberg.

340
00:21:40,505 --> 00:21:41,964
No, you're not leaving.

341
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:44,008
He's already signed the papers.
Dad, don't.

342
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:45,676
It's for the best, son.
Your best.

343
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:47,678
You know... It's for her best.

344
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,930
It's not for my best. It's for her best.
Look at her.

345
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:51,390
No.
Listen to her.

346
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:53,184
He's not gonna...
I know it's not. Don't...

347
00:21:53,185 --> 00:21:58,185
Mom. Mom. Mom. Get off.

348
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,070
This is your fault.

349
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:49,444
Complicated enough?

350
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:54,741
At least you have her.

351
00:22:55,956 --> 00:23:00,956
My father left me
when I was four.

352
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:18,686
I've been thinking
about what Yeats said.

353
00:23:18,687 --> 00:23:23,687
To be reborn,
you have to die first.

354
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,864
What do you suggest?

355
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:34,702
I spent my entire life
making other people happy.

356
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:37,162
It's time I find happiness
the only way I see possible.

357
00:23:37,163 --> 00:23:38,956
Oh, please.

358
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:40,916
Die already.

359
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:44,795
Where's the verve? The brio?

360
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:49,049
If it be that I am indulging
my self-consciousness

361
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,635
in justifying myself
or if it be...

362
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:53,012
That's a run-on.
Don't edit me.

363
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:20,831
<i>The New Vision declares...</i>

364
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:22,666
<i>"Proclaims. " It's better.</i>

365
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:25,336
Proclaims
the death of morality.

366
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:27,421
The expression of self.

367
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:30,633
The true, uninhibited, uncensored
expression of the self.

368
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:33,093
Words, boys.
Empty words.

369
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:34,345
Well, what do
you suggest?

370
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:38,432
The derangement of the senses.

371
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:00,371
<i>What do you hate
from the pit of your gut?</i>

372
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:01,538
Institutions.

373
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:04,291
Paterson, New Jersey.

374
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:05,376
My father.

375
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:06,835
Bingo.

376
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,929
And the Shakespeare...

377
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,182
All right.

378
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:23,394
Extraordinary men
propel society forward.

379
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:25,396
It is our duty
to break the law.

380
00:25:25,397 --> 00:25:27,398
Really? It's how we
make the world wider.

381
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:28,983
You are an extraordinary man.

382
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:30,109
Well, thank you.

383
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,862
<i>WILLIAM; Return Of the Native.</i>

384
00:25:33,863 --> 00:25:35,656
<i>Leviathan.</i>

385
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:41,741
Tear 'em up, boys. Destroy
the old and build the new.

386
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,580
Chaucer. Gibbon.

387
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:13,754
Watch this.

388
00:27:13,755 --> 00:27:18,755
Go.

389
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:01,677
What the hell is this?

390
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:03,512
Time slows down

391
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:07,224
as you drift deeper and deeper
into your cave.

392
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:12,225
We are exploring the avenues
of Allen's mind.

393
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:15,983
Dimly lit, I'm sure. What have
you done to my apartment?

394
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:18,402
Don't touch anything.
We need to write it all down.

395
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:22,698
Grab a pair of scissors. Get
this man a pair of scissors.

396
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:25,159
This is not your revolution.
This is my life.

397
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,412
What kind of life
is it, David?

398
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:29,621
It's mine.

399
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:33,625
Not everyone
gets an allowance.

400
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:36,503
Leave.

401
00:28:36,504 --> 00:28:41,091
Just get out.

402
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:43,760
I need to speak with you.

403
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:47,639
Alone.

404
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:06,408
It only
has to be five pages.

405
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:09,453
You make me too smart, they're
gonna suspect something's up.

406
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:11,997
And get you sent back
to your mother again?

407
00:29:11,998 --> 00:29:15,334
That would just
be the end of you.

408
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:20,335
Fuck you.

409
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:28,805
<i>Kill your darlings,</i>

410
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:30,933
your crushes,
your juvenile metaphysics.

411
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:32,976
None of them
belong on the page.

412
00:29:32,977 --> 00:29:36,647
It is the first principle
of good creative work,

413
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:41,648
a work of fiction you will
deliver as your final exam.

414
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:43,487
Look.

415
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:48,488
Whitman Junior graced us
with his presence today.

416
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:54,581
"The New Vision.

417
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:57,334
"Extraordinary men
propel us forward.

418
00:29:57,335 --> 00:30:01,755
"It is our duty
to break the law."

419
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:03,674
Fantastic.

420
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:05,550
There's more life
in those five pages

421
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:10,551
thanin the dozens of bad sonnets
we've read in this class.

422
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:12,724
You want life?

423
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:16,103
You want the world on fire?

424
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:21,104
The war awaits.

425
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:26,734
What Will it be?

426
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:30,534
"The rose
that scents the summer air

427
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:33,578
"grows from
my beloved's hair."

428
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:35,831
Keep going.
That's my sonnet for Steeves.

429
00:30:35,832 --> 00:30:37,624
We have the map.

430
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,751
We have the manifesto.

431
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:44,752
We need the work.

432
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:50,762
I was wrong.

433
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:55,763
Maybe you're not up
for this after all.

434
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:58,603
Show me your fucking map.

435
00:30:58,604 --> 00:30:59,688
Mmm! Stop.

436
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:01,064
No, there's nothing here

437
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:02,941
because David's not here
to write it for you.

438
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,359
It's complicated.

439
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:09,360
I love complicated.

440
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:16,038
He is a professor
working as a janitor

441
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,457
so he can be near
his precious Lu-Lu.

442
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:23,458
He is a goddamn fruit
who won't let me go.

443
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:26,798
A fruit?

444
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,799
A queer.

445
00:31:42,774 --> 00:31:46,109
Then“.

446
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:51,110
You know,
let's get rid of him.

447
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,250
Right now, I just need you to
write us something beautiful.

448
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:12,882
First thought,
best thought.

449
00:32:53,177 --> 00:32:58,177
Allen in Wonderland.

450
00:33:09,902 --> 00:33:12,821
<i>Pervitin.</i>

451
00:33:12,822 --> 00:33:17,534
<i>The Germans called
it the "Wunderdroge."</i>

452
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:22,535
Prescribed for
superhuman feats.

453
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,887
<i>But beware of the side effects</i>

454
00:33:36,888 --> 00:33:38,805
which include sudden
bouts of blindness,

455
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:40,724
diarrhea, heart palpitations

456
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:45,725
and a severe decline
in moral standards.

457
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,864
Unbloomed stalwart.

458
00:33:56,949 --> 00:34:01,411
Come out and play.

459
00:34:01,412 --> 00:34:03,538
What the hell are you doing?

460
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,458
Writing.

461
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:10,212
<i>But the words...</i>

462
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:15,213
Oh, the words.

463
00:34:15,593 --> 00:34:18,178
Yeah.

464
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,179
Lu, it's very rough.

465
00:34:24,435 --> 00:34:26,269
Oh.

466
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,688
The vision at last.

467
00:34:28,689 --> 00:34:30,857
Can I see?

468
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:32,025
Where's Lu?

469
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:34,611
He's out.

470
00:34:34,612 --> 00:34:39,533
With a senior football player.

471
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:41,243
A writer.

472
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:43,954
And handsome, too.

473
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:46,623
James?

474
00:34:46,624 --> 00:34:48,792
Jack. There it is.

475
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:51,336
Jack.

476
00:34:51,337 --> 00:34:52,504
You're not allowed
to be here.

477
00:34:53,714 --> 00:34:56,883
That's odd since I'm the
only thing keeping him here.

478
00:34:56,884 --> 00:35:01,884
Not anymore.

479
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:08,812
Piece of advice.

480
00:35:08,813 --> 00:35:11,606
You don't know Lu.

481
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:15,777
As soon as you think you do,
he'll find someone else.

482
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:20,778
Maybe he already has.

483
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:28,661
What, are you moving in?

484
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:32,627
Where have you been?

485
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:36,214
I found a real writer.

486
00:35:36,215 --> 00:35:40,552
Already a million words under
his belt before Columbia.

487
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:43,430
You mean Jack?

488
00:35:43,431 --> 00:35:45,181
Why didn't you tell me?

489
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:50,182
What, am I
supposed to do newsreels?

490
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:54,399
What's that?

491
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,321
Oh, nothing.

492
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:04,322
If you're going to stay,
don't hog the blanket.

493
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:27,182
Why is Jack
a real writer?

494
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:30,560
Once you meet him,
you'll see what I mean.

495
00:36:30,561 --> 00:36:31,227
Hey, AI.
No.

496
00:36:31,228 --> 00:36:32,354
Hey, AI.
No.

497
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:34,147
Come on.
No.

498
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:38,902
No.

499
00:36:38,903 --> 00:36:42,781
Oh! Fumble.

500
00:36:42,782 --> 00:36:44,074
Jack, what was that?

501
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:47,744
The damn cat.

502
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:52,745
Shh! She painted it.
Say nothing.

503
00:36:59,924 --> 00:37:02,550
- Hey, when did this come?
- Today.

504
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:04,761
It's from Sammy.
Where is he now?

505
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:07,931
I don't know.
Some battleship.

506
00:37:07,932 --> 00:37:09,599
What do you think?

507
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,267
It's brilliant, no?

508
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:13,311
It's missing some
periods and commas.

509
00:37:13,312 --> 00:37:15,605
It's better than
anything you've ever written.

510
00:37:15,606 --> 00:37:16,940
I use periods and commas.

511
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:19,150
Both of you, quiet.

512
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:22,487
<i>Kerouac.
How are you, chum?</i>

513
00:37:22,488 --> 00:37:24,864
Sammy, you bastard.

514
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:26,700
Who's Sammy?

515
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:29,119
My best friend since I was 12.
Off in the Navy.

516
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,788
<i>We've just been through 20
days of German shelling</i>

517
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:34,666
<i>every three hours,
night and day.</i>

518
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,626
<i>This will be
my last one for a while.</i>

519
00:37:36,627 --> 00:37:41,627
<i>Tomorrow we 're headed out to the
front, some beach near Rome. Anzio?</i>

520
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:43,007
Go sit at the table.

521
00:37:43,008 --> 00:37:48,008
<i>It's supposed to
be beautiful...</i>

522
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:56,563
I didn't know
we were having guests.

523
00:37:56,564 --> 00:37:58,314
What's this?

524
00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:02,485
I was aiming for stew.

525
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:04,863
Yeah? You missed.

526
00:38:04,864 --> 00:38:06,281
Come on, guys.

527
00:38:06,282 --> 00:38:08,616
Where are you going?
Out.

528
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:11,661
Out? I have been
cooking all day for you.

529
00:38:11,662 --> 00:38:13,788
What? What do you want?
Want me to eat shoe leather?

530
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:15,999
I'm hungry, and what you do
in the kitchen's unholy.

531
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,834
That's funny.
You talk like a Catholic,

532
00:38:17,835 --> 00:38:19,627
but you fuck me
and won't marry me.

533
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:21,337
How does that work?
Shut your mouth, Edie.

534
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:26,338
I thought you
liked it wide open.

535
00:38:33,392 --> 00:38:35,185
Scram.

536
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:36,936
Um...

537
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:41,107
Allen.

538
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:44,861
So, Al.
Thought my novel was shit?

539
00:38:44,862 --> 00:38:46,362
Not exactly. It's not
what I would choose...

540
00:38:46,363 --> 00:38:48,448
It's all true.

541
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:50,533
Jack served in
the merchant marines.

542
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:52,577
I left school
twice already.

543
00:38:52,578 --> 00:38:55,121
Columbia's full of squares.

544
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:57,832
Not even sure why I
bothered to come back.

545
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,543
Why don't you
just ship out again?

546
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:05,544
Trust me, sometimes when I
fight with Edie, I want to.

547
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:12,301
Well, you two did just fight.

548
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Carr, you're goddamn crazy.

549
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:23,441
"A new vision." Yeah.

550
00:39:23,442 --> 00:39:25,485
Sounds phony.

551
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:28,112
Movements are
cooked up by people

552
00:39:28,113 --> 00:39:30,698
who can't write
about the people who can.

553
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:33,076
I don't think he gets
what we're trying to do.

554
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:34,869
Listen to me.

555
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,204
This whole town's
full of finks

556
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:39,624
on the 30th floor
writing pure chintz.

557
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:43,878
Writers. A real writer's
gotta be in the beds,

558
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:48,550
down in the trenches
and all the broken places.

559
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:50,343
Where were your trenches, Al?

560
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:52,929
Allen.
Right.

561
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,305
First thought, best thought.

562
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:55,890
Fuck you.
What does that even mean?

563
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:58,768
That's good.
That's one. What else?

564
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,436
Fuck your one million words.

565
00:40:00,437 --> 00:40:02,272
Yes, even better.

566
00:40:02,273 --> 00:40:04,274
You don't know me.

567
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:06,359
You're right.

568
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Who is "you"?

569
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:24,085
"Be careful.

570
00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:27,755
"You are not in Wonderland.

571
00:40:27,756 --> 00:40:32,756
"I've heard the strange madness
long growing in your soul.

572
00:40:35,347 --> 00:40:39,017
"But you are fortunate
in your ignorance,

573
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:43,062
"in your isolation.

574
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:47,233
"You who have suffered

575
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:50,278
"find where love hides.

576
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:55,279
"Give, share, lose,

577
00:40:57,661 --> 00:41:02,661
"lest we die unbloomed."

578
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:14,135
Al?

579
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:19,136
That was beautiful, kid.

580
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,852
You wrote that?

581
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:27,853
You asked me to.

582
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:30,902
Forget Columbia.

583
00:41:30,903 --> 00:41:33,988
Forget Ogden Nash.

584
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:36,491
Here's the plan, boys.
We join the merchant marines,

585
00:41:37,576 --> 00:41:39,702
sail the world
until the war ends,

586
00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:44,703
then jump ship and make it
to Paris for the liberation.

587
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:47,377
And you don't speak French.

588
00:41:47,378 --> 00:41:49,545
Jack does.

589
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:54,546
It'll be us together
at the beginning.

590
00:41:54,635 --> 00:41:59,597
It'll be the perfect day.

591
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:09,687
Jesus Christ.
Get your hands in the air.

592
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:17,031
You have managed
to matriculate and drop out

593
00:42:17,032 --> 00:42:22,032
of Tulane, Bowdoin
and the University of Chicago.

594
00:42:22,162 --> 00:42:27,162
Your attendance record here
is abominable.

595
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:29,752
You've ignored curfew.

596
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:32,255
Your papers, when you
bother to turn them in,

597
00:42:32,256 --> 00:42:35,091
exceed
the assigned page limit.

598
00:42:38,846 --> 00:42:41,973
Can you explain
why you're at Columbia?

599
00:42:41,974 --> 00:42:43,433
Well, the same reason you are.

600
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:45,685
What is that?

601
00:42:45,686 --> 00:42:50,686
Loose Barnard girls.

602
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:53,651
I know about
your difficulties,

603
00:42:53,652 --> 00:42:58,652
about what happened
in Chicago.

604
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:03,786
You told him?

605
00:43:03,787 --> 00:43:05,496
He's not the enemy.

606
00:43:05,497 --> 00:43:09,125
You see, the university
acts in loco parentis.

607
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:11,461
You are our responsibility.

608
00:43:11,462 --> 00:43:14,505
We're trying to find some way
to make this all work for you.

609
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:21,929
Who said anybody could know
anything about anything?

610
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,306
Lucien,
your temper.

611
00:43:23,307 --> 00:43:24,515
Things were going fine

612
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:28,436
and you're just spreading rumors
to get me kicked out of here.

613
00:43:28,437 --> 00:43:32,356
Allen.
What the hell's going on?

614
00:43:32,357 --> 00:43:34,650
Who's she?

615
00:43:34,651 --> 00:43:38,029
Hi. I'm Edith Cohen.

616
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,989
What's she doing here?

617
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,658
I've been
divorced for some time.

618
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:44,327
I'll go wait outside.

619
00:43:44,328 --> 00:43:49,165
This is the kind of
childish outburst...

620
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:53,878
So that's why
you locked Mom up.

621
00:43:53,879 --> 00:43:55,421
Get back here
immediately.

622
00:43:55,422 --> 00:44:00,422
Lucien. Lucien.

623
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:02,470
Lucien!

624
00:44:02,471 --> 00:44:06,641
Did he put you
up to this?

625
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:08,601
No.

626
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:12,855
I stole the boat.

627
00:44:12,856 --> 00:44:17,856
And it was tremendous.

628
00:44:28,705 --> 00:44:33,705
Where are you going?

629
00:44:34,336 --> 00:44:38,214
You know me now.

630
00:44:38,215 --> 00:44:40,550
I'm only good at beginnings.

631
00:44:40,551 --> 00:44:45,551
What, you're dropping out?

632
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:52,099
Best of luck.

633
00:44:54,898 --> 00:44:56,691
Okay.

634
00:44:56,692 --> 00:45:00,903
My father showed up today
with some new woman

635
00:45:00,904 --> 00:45:05,074
and in the middle of all the
"Allen's a screw-up" monologue,

636
00:45:05,075 --> 00:45:10,075
all of a sudden,
I realized I don't care.

637
00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:14,917
I've never not cared.

638
00:45:14,918 --> 00:45:18,504
So, I told them it was my idea

639
00:45:18,505 --> 00:45:21,632
to steal the boat.

640
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:22,800
Why?

641
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:27,801
Because I don't want to be
the person they think I am.

642
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:31,601
I am on academic probation
and I could get kicked out.

643
00:45:31,602 --> 00:45:35,021
You can't leave.

644
00:45:35,022 --> 00:45:36,439
You started something

645
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,440
and I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do next.

646
00:45:44,531 --> 00:45:47,742
It's our turn.

647
00:45:47,743 --> 00:45:52,163
Let's show them
what we can do.

648
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:57,164
You in?

649
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:02,798
You mustn't drink while you're
handling it, and no writing in it.

650
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:05,676
It comes back
exactly as you've got it.

651
00:46:05,677 --> 00:46:09,347
Next.

652
00:46:09,348 --> 00:46:12,016
Once you get the book,
treat it very, very well.

653
00:46:12,017 --> 00:46:15,603
And you don't break the binding.
Now follow me.

654
00:46:15,604 --> 00:46:20,604
All right.

655
00:46:21,026 --> 00:46:26,026
Hey, no telling Edie.

656
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,409
Maybe you can help me
with something.

657
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,078
You're checking out
all these books.

658
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,915
I'm asking myself,
do you ever get checked out?

659
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:39,168
Twenty-five seconds.

660
00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:40,378
Masterful.

661
00:46:40,379 --> 00:46:44,215
Hi.
Hi.

662
00:46:44,216 --> 00:46:47,885
Damn it. Shift's over.

663
00:46:47,886 --> 00:46:50,346
See you tomorrow.

664
00:46:50,347 --> 00:46:55,347
I'll go.

665
00:46:58,689 --> 00:47:03,025
Hi. Uh, I wondered
if you could help me.

666
00:47:03,026 --> 00:47:05,111
Sure.

667
00:47:05,112 --> 00:47:07,863
I'm looking for a book.

668
00:47:07,864 --> 00:47:09,949
Okay.

669
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,034
Does this book have a title?

670
00:47:12,035 --> 00:47:14,203
Yes. Yes. Um...

671
00:47:14,204 --> 00:47:19,204
<i>It's called
The Day Amanda Came.</i>

672
00:47:24,214 --> 00:47:27,675
Ah.

673
00:47:27,676 --> 00:47:32,138
Well, um,
you'll have to wait.

674
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:37,139
I can't leave the desk.

675
00:47:38,937 --> 00:47:43,937
I really need it.

676
00:47:46,611 --> 00:47:50,865
Okay.

677
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:55,866
Only for you.

678
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:06,964
Shit.

679
00:48:06,965 --> 00:48:09,508
So working here
must be a drag.

680
00:48:09,509 --> 00:48:12,428
I like it. It's
the only way I meet boys.

681
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:14,305
They're very,
very strict at Barnard.

682
00:48:14,306 --> 00:48:16,223
Oh, really? How strict?

683
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:20,561
Well, for example, they
would never let me do this.

684
00:48:20,562 --> 00:48:22,646
Right. No.

685
00:48:22,647 --> 00:48:25,608
Go.

686
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:26,817
Did you know
I've never done it

687
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:28,361
with someone who
was Jewish before?

688
00:48:28,362 --> 00:48:30,821
I'm really excited to
see what it looks like.

689
00:48:30,822 --> 00:48:34,950
Well, uh...

690
00:48:34,951 --> 00:48:36,369
I'm sorry.

691
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:40,498
I thought you were saying
something, but not saying it.

692
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:42,500
Should we find your book?

693
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:46,128
The key.

694
00:48:46,129 --> 00:48:48,214
There is no book.

695
00:48:48,215 --> 00:48:49,632
Take it off.

696
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:53,344
Really?

697
00:48:53,345 --> 00:48:58,345
You. You take it off.
Oh, okay.

698
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:06,770
I'm not a virgin. I have done
it with four guys already.

699
00:49:11,029 --> 00:49:13,614
You're kind of
a virgin though, huh?

700
00:49:13,615 --> 00:49:15,658
No.
Liar.

701
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:19,662
See, if you have done it before,
you'll last for 30 seconds.

702
00:49:19,663 --> 00:49:24,663
Start counting.

703
00:49:26,002 --> 00:49:27,711
One,

704
00:49:27,712 --> 00:49:31,882
two...

705
00:49:31,883 --> 00:49:35,928
Three...

706
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:39,348
Four“

707
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:42,184
Five...

708
00:49:42,185 --> 00:49:44,687
Six,

709
00:49:44,688 --> 00:49:47,314
seven,

710
00:49:47,315 --> 00:49:52,315
eight...

711
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:54,447
Nine...

712
00:49:54,448 --> 00:49:59,448
Oh...

713
00:50:06,877 --> 00:50:08,711
I knew it.

714
00:50:08,712 --> 00:50:13,712
I bet you don't even read.

715
00:50:15,218 --> 00:50:19,597
I do.

716
00:50:19,598 --> 00:50:23,225
This is it, guys.
This is our Bastille.

717
00:50:23,226 --> 00:50:25,895
No chickening out.

718
00:50:37,073 --> 00:50:39,992
<i>Say, say, my playmate</i>

719
00:50:39,993 --> 00:50:42,703
<i>Won't you lay
your hands on me</i>

720
00:50:42,704 --> 00:50:45,414
<i>Mirror my malady</i>

721
00:50:45,415 --> 00:50:48,167
<i>Transfer my tragedy</i>

722
00:50:48,168 --> 00:50:50,753
<i>Got a curse I cannot lift</i>

723
00:50:50,754 --> 00:50:52,463
<i>Shines
when the sunset shifts</i>

724
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:57,092
<i>When the moon is round and
full Gotta bust that box</i>

725
00:50:57,093 --> 00:50:59,053
<i>Gotta gut that fish
My mind's aflame</i>

726
00:50:59,054 --> 00:51:01,597
<i>We could jet in a stolen car</i>

727
00:51:01,598 --> 00:51:04,350
<i>But I bet we wouldn't
get too far</i>

728
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:06,560
<i>Before
the transformation takes</i>

729
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:10,147
<i>Its blood lust tanks
and crave gets slaked</i>

730
00:51:10,148 --> 00:51:11,315
Excuse me.

731
00:51:11,316 --> 00:51:16,316
I think I saw some light
or movement in the library.

732
00:51:42,305 --> 00:51:47,305
What just happened?

733
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:53,061
We know you're here!

734
00:51:53,316 --> 00:51:58,316
Come on.

735
00:52:05,704 --> 00:52:06,954
Lu?

736
00:52:06,955 --> 00:52:09,665
Bill, what the hell?
It's locked!

737
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:15,792
This way.

738
00:52:20,677 --> 00:52:25,347
I think they're
this way.

739
00:52:25,348 --> 00:52:28,392
We know you're here.

740
00:52:28,393 --> 00:52:33,393
Come out!

741
00:52:46,703 --> 00:52:50,122
Hey!

742
00:52:51,916 --> 00:52:54,877
Lu, that's enough! What's
wrong with you? Come on.

743
00:52:54,878 --> 00:52:59,048
Not yet.
We have to finish.

744
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:01,717
Enough now! It's over!

745
00:53:01,718 --> 00:53:04,386
Let me go! Allen!

746
00:53:04,387 --> 00:53:06,138
Let go! Let...

747
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:08,474
Allen! Get off of me.

748
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:09,725
One prick.

749
00:53:09,726 --> 00:53:10,934
Allen.

750
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:15,935
Allen!

751
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:21,650
Let's go!

752
00:53:24,074 --> 00:53:29,074
You guys open
this goddamn door right now.

753
00:53:32,415 --> 00:53:34,375
Open this
fucking door right now.

754
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:39,376
Open the fuck up.
Open the...

755
00:53:41,883 --> 00:53:45,344
The South Hall library
is a church

756
00:53:45,345 --> 00:53:50,345
and these are
the sacraments...

757
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:03,153
Oh, my

758
00:54:03,154 --> 00:54:08,154
God.

759
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:13,201
To literacy.
To literacy indeed.

760
00:54:19,629 --> 00:54:21,463
Jack, that's you, isn't it?

761
00:54:21,464 --> 00:54:25,968
Yup. Last year.

762
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:28,637
They still won.

763
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:32,683
Look at them.

764
00:54:32,684 --> 00:54:36,854
Souvenir history.

765
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:41,855
To make people think they
left some mark on the world.

766
00:54:42,152 --> 00:54:47,152
Because otherwise,
nobody would ever know.

767
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,161
I never want to
end up on that wall.

768
00:54:52,162 --> 00:54:55,622
Have no fear.
You never will.

769
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:03,046
What's he doing here?

770
00:55:03,047 --> 00:55:08,047
Since you didn't stop by earlier,
I just hoped to give you this.

771
00:55:10,722 --> 00:55:12,222
Maybe he didn't
want to see you.

772
00:55:12,223 --> 00:55:17,060
I think he can
speak for himself.

773
00:55:17,061 --> 00:55:20,856
Yup. He says that we should
all have another round.

774
00:55:20,857 --> 00:55:23,150
You've had plenty
of time to celebrate.

775
00:55:23,151 --> 00:55:25,611
Your library high jinks
made the morning paper.

776
00:55:25,612 --> 00:55:30,612
I'm sure you're
all very proud.

777
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:33,911
How do you know it was us?

778
00:55:33,912 --> 00:55:38,912
Did he use that Bastille line?
'Cause I gave it to him.

779
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:44,250
I haven't seen you for days.

780
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:50,590
You left this at my place.

781
00:55:53,264 --> 00:55:58,264
You told the guards we were there.
Nobody else knew.

782
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:05,526
You wanted me to get kicked out.
You ratted on me.

783
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:09,279
Stop, Lu. You're losing control.
You know what comes next.

784
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,447
I know what comes next.

785
00:56:10,448 --> 00:56:12,074
Yeah.

786
00:56:12,075 --> 00:56:17,075
Cut him off.

787
00:56:18,122 --> 00:56:22,918
Best of luck, Janitor.

788
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:24,628
Excuse me?

789
00:56:24,629 --> 00:56:27,923
We are over.

790
00:56:27,924 --> 00:56:32,924
Leave.

791
00:56:35,932 --> 00:56:40,932
Look at me, Lu.

792
00:56:41,437 --> 00:56:46,437
You said I was
everything to you.

793
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:52,281
You are everything to me.

794
00:56:52,282 --> 00:56:57,202
Everything to me,
do you hear me?

795
00:56:57,203 --> 00:56:58,704
Let's go.

796
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:03,705
Please, Lu. Please?

797
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,670
David,
time and place.

798
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:11,671
Shut up, traitor.

799
00:57:12,635 --> 00:57:17,635
You'd be dead
if it weren't for me.

800
00:57:34,365 --> 00:57:37,993
You'd be boring
if it weren't for me.

801
00:57:41,623 --> 00:57:44,416
And go!

802
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:47,044
Oh, my God!

803
00:57:47,045 --> 00:57:49,588
Jack! Jack!

804
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:51,131
Jack!

805
00:57:51,132 --> 00:57:52,925
Ow!

806
00:57:52,926 --> 00:57:54,676
He broke his fucking neck.

807
00:57:54,677 --> 00:57:59,014
The warrior poet
has passed on.

808
00:57:59,015 --> 00:58:01,141
No!
Oh!

809
00:58:01,142 --> 00:58:02,351
He lives!

810
00:58:02,352 --> 00:58:03,518
Excellent!

811
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:05,854
Judges award a...

812
00:58:05,855 --> 00:58:07,564
Nine!

813
00:58:09,025 --> 00:58:10,233
Oh, my God.

814
00:58:10,234 --> 00:58:13,070
Jack.

815
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:16,531
All right, Ginsy, your turn.

816
00:58:16,532 --> 00:58:21,532
No,no,no,no.

817
00:58:23,998 --> 00:58:28,998
This is just the beginning,
you know.

818
00:58:30,421 --> 00:58:35,421
Your fault, Ginsy.

819
00:58:36,928 --> 00:58:41,928
It's all your fault.

820
00:59:05,289 --> 00:59:10,289
First thought,
best thought.

821
00:59:33,943 --> 00:59:38,943
I think I just
puked on the inside.

822
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:48,369
Let's go, Jack.

823
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,250
What?

824
00:59:50,251 --> 00:59:51,334
Wait.
Al, are you coming?

825
00:59:51,335 --> 00:59:55,297
No, Allen's got work to do.

826
00:59:55,298 --> 00:59:59,342
<i>Ten pages on Spengler's Decline of the West.
Due tomorrow.</i>

827
00:59:59,343 --> 01:00:04,343
Excuse me?

828
01:00:04,474 --> 01:00:08,477
I'd be lost
without you, Ginsy.

829
01:00:08,478 --> 01:00:13,478
Come on, lion.

830
01:00:22,742 --> 01:00:25,452
Fuck!

831
01:00:25,453 --> 01:00:27,621
<i>Allied forces in Anzio...</i>

832
01:00:28,706 --> 01:00:30,624
Edie bird!

833
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,167
My Edie bird.

834
01:00:32,168 --> 01:00:37,168
I'm just gonna use the loo.

835
01:00:37,256 --> 01:00:39,007
Say hi to Gram.

836
01:00:39,008 --> 01:00:42,135
<i>...burrow and cover in a honeycomb
of trenches and foxholes.</i>

837
01:00:42,136 --> 01:00:47,136
We invited her over for her birthday.
We made her a cake.

838
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:50,185
Well, then we
should have a drink.

839
01:00:50,186 --> 01:00:53,021
How about a drink,
Grandma Frankie?

840
01:00:53,022 --> 01:00:56,858
You want some red wine?

841
01:00:56,859 --> 01:00:58,485
Where the hell
have you been?

842
01:00:58,486 --> 01:01:00,278
I was out.

843
01:01:00,279 --> 01:01:01,905
I packed all your stuff.
It's in your bag.

844
01:01:01,906 --> 01:01:03,490
I'm gonna be
at Gram's tonight.

845
01:01:03,491 --> 01:01:05,575
Whoa, hey, hey.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

846
01:01:05,576 --> 01:01:07,077
No, you just say that.
I'm sorry.

847
01:01:07,078 --> 01:01:10,705
It's one of your million words,
and they don't mean anything.

848
01:01:10,706 --> 01:01:15,706
Just don't be here when I
come back in the morning.

849
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:52,372
I know this is crazy.

850
01:01:52,373 --> 01:01:53,999
I don't even know
what I'm doing here,

851
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,503
but I just had to

852
01:01:58,504 --> 01:02:01,631
tell you I'm sorry.

853
01:02:01,632 --> 01:02:05,886
Let me make it up to you.

854
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:09,723
Lu, where are you?

855
01:02:09,724 --> 01:02:14,724
I'm going back to bed.

856
01:02:18,274 --> 01:02:23,274
Another word
and I call the police.

857
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:42,793
What the hell?

858
01:02:52,975 --> 01:02:54,142
Jesus Christ!

859
01:02:59,982 --> 01:03:04,982
What kind of sick son of a bitch
would do something like this?

860
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:07,155
It was David.

861
01:03:07,156 --> 01:03:10,784
I'll wring his fucking neck.

862
01:03:10,785 --> 01:03:15,785
It's okay. It's okay.

863
01:03:18,292 --> 01:03:23,292
I have another idea.

864
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:03,503
Lu,

865
01:04:03,504 --> 01:04:08,504
Your paper.

866
01:04:12,888 --> 01:04:15,765
Where are you going?

867
01:04:15,766 --> 01:04:19,853
Sailing out.

868
01:04:19,854 --> 01:04:24,274
To Paris.

869
01:04:24,275 --> 01:04:29,070
We're gonna make a ship
as merchant seamen.

870
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:32,490
Jack knows the tricks.

871
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:36,578
You weren't gonna tell me?

872
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:41,579
We both know
why you can't come.

873
01:04:49,342 --> 01:04:54,342
FUCK you!

874
01:04:54,722 --> 01:04:57,932
You're a phony.

875
01:04:57,933 --> 01:05:00,143
And you got me
and Jack and Bill

876
01:05:00,144 --> 01:05:01,561
making your vision come true

877
01:05:01,562 --> 01:05:03,188
because you
can't do it yourself.

878
01:05:03,189 --> 01:05:05,607
No, Allen.

879
01:05:05,608 --> 01:05:07,275
You got what you wanted.

880
01:05:07,276 --> 01:05:09,944
You were ordinary, just
like every other freshman.

881
01:05:09,945 --> 01:05:13,239
And I made your life
extraordinary.

882
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,158
Go be you now,
all by yourself.

883
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:18,161
Leave me alone.

884
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:19,788
You don't mean that.

885
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:24,789
Allen!
Please.

886
01:05:25,127 --> 01:05:30,127
Leave.

887
01:06:05,501 --> 01:06:07,919
Allen, have you seen him?

888
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,003
He's not in his room.

889
01:06:09,004 --> 01:06:12,257
He left.

890
01:06:12,258 --> 01:06:15,135
I did something wrong.

891
01:06:15,136 --> 01:06:17,595
Really wrong.

892
01:06:17,596 --> 01:06:20,765
You have no reason to help me.
But...

893
01:06:20,766 --> 01:06:24,936
But?

894
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:29,274
I know who you are.

895
01:06:29,275 --> 01:06:34,275
We're the ones he needs
but never wants.

896
01:06:36,198 --> 01:06:41,198
It hurts, doesn't it?

897
01:06:42,204 --> 01:06:47,204
All I'm asking is that
you tell me where he is.

898
01:06:48,836 --> 01:06:53,836
Please.

899
01:07:03,517 --> 01:07:05,977
Let me see your papers.

900
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:09,731
Two seamen
reporting for duty.

901
01:07:09,732 --> 01:07:11,900
What's your name?

902
01:07:11,901 --> 01:07:14,444
Arthur Rimbaud.

903
01:07:14,445 --> 01:07:17,530
Go upstairs
to get on the docket.

904
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:22,531
Let's go get on the docket.

905
01:07:22,536 --> 01:07:24,579
Goddamn son of a bitch!

906
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:29,580
Let me handle this.

907
01:07:30,794 --> 01:07:35,131
How did you know
that I would be here?

908
01:07:35,132 --> 01:07:38,009
Listen,
I spoke to a guy upstairs.

909
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:40,512
I got us two passes.

910
01:07:40,513 --> 01:07:43,598
I packed for both of us.

911
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:48,269
We can leave.

912
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:53,270
The reason I am leaving
is you.

913
01:07:57,154 --> 01:08:02,154
Then you and Jack take them.
I'll catch up.

914
01:08:06,705 --> 01:08:11,705
Come with me.

915
01:08:12,795 --> 01:08:16,881
We're taking a walk.

916
01:08:16,882 --> 01:08:20,510
<i>We'll have a blue room</i>

917
01:08:20,511 --> 01:08:22,804
Can I have a whiskey, please?

918
01:08:22,805 --> 01:08:27,642
<i>A new room for two room</i>

919
01:08:27,643 --> 01:08:32,643
<i>Where every day's a holiday</i>

920
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:35,650
<i>Because you're married to me</i>

921
01:08:39,196 --> 01:08:44,196
<i>Not like a ballroom</i>

922
01:08:44,827 --> 01:08:49,827
<i>A small room, a hall room</i>

923
01:08:49,957 --> 01:08:54,957
<i>Where I can smoke
my pipe away</i>

924
01:08:56,088 --> 01:09:01,088
I'm sorry.

925
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:06,510
<i>We will thrive on
Keep alive on</i>

926
01:09:09,351 --> 01:09:14,351
Lu?

927
01:09:15,941 --> 01:09:18,526
Oh.

928
01:09:18,527 --> 01:09:23,527
<i>On little blue chairs</i>

929
01:09:23,616 --> 01:09:28,616
<i>You sew your trousseau</i>

930
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:38,459
This came for you today.

931
01:09:42,092 --> 01:09:47,092
Sam.

932
01:09:52,394 --> 01:09:56,981
<i>Jack, old chum.</i>

933
01:09:56,982 --> 01:10:01,982
<i>I'm on a hospital ship now.
My gut's all tore up.</i>

934
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:09,239
<i>Anzio's gonna be the last place
I ever see with my eyes.</i>

935
01:10:18,295 --> 01:10:23,295
<i>A mortar round came
and found me in my tent.</i>

936
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,099
<i>I can feel metal
under my skin some places.</i>

937
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:35,520
<i>Some went clean through.</i>

938
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:40,521
<i>They're not even trying
to take it out no more.</i>

939
01:10:59,461 --> 01:11:01,963
<i>The nurses gave me
the same morphine</i>

940
01:11:01,964 --> 01:11:06,964
<i>I gave to dying boys when
I didn't know what else to do.</i>

941
01:11:19,773 --> 01:11:24,773
<i>"Wake, melancholy Mother,</i>

942
01:11:27,865 --> 01:11:32,865
<i>"wake and weep!</i>

943
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:44,001
<i>"Quench within</i>

944
01:11:46,675 --> 01:11:51,675
<i>"their burning bed,
Thy fiery tears,</i>

945
01:11:54,516 --> 01:11:59,516
<i>"and let thou
loud heart keep..."</i>

946
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:05,443
What was that?

947
01:12:05,444 --> 01:12:09,614
Shelley's elegy for Keats.

948
01:12:09,615 --> 01:12:13,701
What does that mean?

949
01:12:13,702 --> 01:12:18,702
It means he's dead.

950
01:12:28,217 --> 01:12:30,009
He didn't come
back here afterward.

951
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:35,010
Nobody on the floor saw.

952
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:39,185
We have two in custody. We're
still gathering evidence.

953
01:12:39,186 --> 01:12:44,186
So what else do we
know about this guy?

954
01:12:46,276 --> 01:12:50,446
Edie. ls Jack there?

955
01:12:50,447 --> 01:12:52,114
<i>You don't know?</i>

956
01:12:52,115 --> 01:12:56,661
Know what?

957
01:12:56,662 --> 01:13:00,248
The police came and took him
down to the Tombs

958
01:13:00,249 --> 01:13:01,833
8S 8H accessory.

959
01:13:01,834 --> 01:13:03,918
Bill, too.

960
01:13:03,919 --> 01:13:08,919
What happened?

961
01:13:38,787 --> 01:13:42,498
Allen.

962
01:13:42,499 --> 01:13:47,499
Thank God.

963
01:13:47,963 --> 01:13:50,256
He wanted to hurt me.

964
01:13:50,257 --> 01:13:51,799
I had no choice.

965
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,050
You could've run,

966
01:13:53,051 --> 01:13:54,176
called the police.

967
01:13:54,177 --> 01:13:56,429
Listen.

968
01:13:56,430 --> 01:14:00,641
Somehow he found me
at the Marine Hall.

969
01:14:00,642 --> 01:14:05,479
He said that no matter where
I went, he would follow.

970
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:10,480
When I confronted him,
he exploded.

971
01:14:12,529 --> 01:14:15,990
I had to defend myself.

972
01:14:15,991 --> 01:14:19,911
He wouldn't stop.

973
01:14:19,912 --> 01:14:23,372
How did Jack and Bill
get roped into this?

974
01:14:23,373 --> 01:14:27,543
I went to them after.

975
01:14:27,544 --> 01:14:31,130
<i>First, I went to Jack.</i>

976
01:14:31,131 --> 01:14:34,383
<i>He told me to get rid
of the knife</i>

977
01:14:34,384 --> 01:14:38,304
<i>and to forget the whole thing.</i>

978
01:14:38,305 --> 01:14:43,100
<i>But then I went to Bill.</i>

979
01:14:43,101 --> 01:14:47,396
<i>He told me to get a lawyer.</i>

980
01:14:47,397 --> 01:14:49,023
<i>To confess.</i>

981
01:14:49,024 --> 01:14:54,024
<i>To say that it was
an act of self-defense.</i>

982
01:14:56,907 --> 01:15:01,452
The DA is asking
for my deposition

983
01:15:01,453 --> 01:15:04,538
in writing.

984
01:15:04,539 --> 01:15:06,082
I can't do it.

985
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:10,294
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

986
01:15:10,295 --> 01:15:15,295
I'm gonna be stuck in here
for the rest of my life.

987
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:26,765
Please don't leave me here.

988
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:44,199
I'll do it.

989
01:15:44,746 --> 01:15:49,746
We're going to say
that it was an honor slaying.

990
01:15:53,755 --> 01:15:57,341
<i>"Relating to
a lethal attack committed</i>

991
01:15:57,342 --> 01:16:02,342
<i>"when the accused is defending
himself against a known homosexual.</i>

992
01:16:03,598 --> 01:16:06,684
<i>"If the accused
is heterosexual,</i>

993
01:16:06,685 --> 01:16:09,645
<i>"he shall be pardoned.</i>

994
01:16:09,646 --> 01:16:13,733
<i>"But if
the accused is homosexual,</i>

995
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:18,734
<i>"the charge of murder
in the first degree..."</i>

996
01:16:21,783 --> 01:16:25,411
Dad?

997
01:16:25,412 --> 01:16:28,372
It's $5,000 bail.

998
01:16:28,373 --> 01:16:30,624
I know. I know it's a lot.

999
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:33,586
<i>No Kerouac was ever
wrapped up in a murder.</i>

1000
01:16:33,587 --> 01:16:35,212
<i>Go to hell!</i>

1001
01:16:41,678 --> 01:16:43,596
Would you all
just shut the hell up!

1002
01:16:43,597 --> 01:16:48,559
You must understand that David has
been following him for years.

1003
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,271
When Lu went to Bowdoin, David
appeared out of thin air.

1004
01:16:52,272 --> 01:16:54,523
So I sent him to Chicago.

1005
01:16:54,524 --> 01:16:56,442
Surprise.

1006
01:16:56,443 --> 01:16:58,903
David turned up there, too.

1007
01:16:58,904 --> 01:17:02,364
Then when Lucien
wanted to go to Mexico,

1008
01:17:02,365 --> 01:17:06,535
guess who had a car
idling in the driveway?

1009
01:17:06,536 --> 01:17:09,830
But he didn't
have to go with him.

1010
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:14,831
He spun a web
to ensnare my son.

1011
01:17:15,337 --> 01:17:20,007
That's why I brought him here.

1012
01:17:20,008 --> 01:17:25,008
Lot of good that did.

1013
01:17:27,724 --> 01:17:32,724
What happened in Chicago?

1014
01:17:37,484 --> 01:17:42,484
Thank God Lu has
you in his life.

1015
01:17:43,365 --> 01:17:46,951
You know what, Allen?

1016
01:17:46,952 --> 01:17:51,952
He calls you
his guardian angel.

1017
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:58,041
That's what he called David.

1018
01:17:59,881 --> 01:18:04,593
That man ruined my son.

1019
01:18:04,594 --> 01:18:09,348
You're gonna help me
keep what's left of him.

1020
01:18:09,349 --> 01:18:11,392
Contrary to reports,

1021
01:18:11,393 --> 01:18:16,393
prison is not
a tonic for the spirit.

1022
01:18:16,898 --> 01:18:21,694
All the district attorney cared
about was that David was queer.

1023
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,571
And what did you tell him?

1024
01:18:23,572 --> 01:18:28,572
I said yes.

1025
01:18:28,952 --> 01:18:32,163
Did David do something
to Lu in Chicago?

1026
01:18:32,164 --> 01:18:35,291
Christ, Allen,
please don't get involved.

1027
01:18:35,292 --> 01:18:37,376
I have to be.

1028
01:18:37,377 --> 01:18:42,377
I'm helping him
write his defense.

1029
01:18:45,302 --> 01:18:49,972
David was my friend.

1030
01:18:49,973 --> 01:18:52,600
And he's dead.

1031
01:18:52,601 --> 01:18:57,601
And did Lucien
tell you how he died?

1032
01:18:57,814 --> 01:19:00,149
<i>He might not have wanted you
to know, Allen.</i>

1033
01:19:03,486 --> 01:19:08,486
<i>He tied David up.</i>

1034
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:15,539
<i>Put stones in his pockets
to weigh him down,</i>

1035
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,625
<i>and then dragged
him into the Hudson.</i>

1036
01:19:17,626 --> 01:19:18,959
What?

1037
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,629
<i>He was alive, Allen,</i>

1038
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:24,506
<i>until Lucien made him drown.</i>

1039
01:19:27,135 --> 01:19:29,845
Who are you?
Is he part of this business?

1040
01:19:29,846 --> 01:19:31,513
Leave him alone, Dad.

1041
01:19:31,514 --> 01:19:33,974
I paid your bail.

1042
01:19:33,975 --> 01:19:36,560
Don't talk to me like that.

1043
01:19:36,561 --> 01:19:38,395
Yes, sir.

1044
01:19:38,396 --> 01:19:43,396
The car leaves
in five minutes.

1045
01:19:52,369 --> 01:19:57,369
The libertine circle
has come to an end.

1046
01:20:03,171 --> 01:20:08,171
Go back to the beginning.

1047
01:21:14,075 --> 01:21:17,036
<i>Breathe in</i>

1048
01:21:17,037 --> 01:21:19,747
<i>Breathe in</i>

1049
01:21:28,882 --> 01:21:33,882
"Cook's County
Hospital of Chicago."

1050
01:21:46,232 --> 01:21:51,232
"David Kammerer."

1051
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,195
<i>He would leave me
alone in the house.</i>

1052
01:23:15,196 --> 01:23:16,238
I was gonna die there.

1053
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:17,322
No, you weren't.

1054
01:23:17,323 --> 01:23:18,407
Yeah, I know it.

1055
01:23:18,408 --> 01:23:23,036
No, Mom. Stop.

1056
01:23:23,037 --> 01:23:26,707
Hey. I'm okay now.

1057
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:31,708
I'm your mother and I'm okay.

1058
01:23:32,338 --> 01:23:36,633
But you're not.

1059
01:23:36,634 --> 01:23:41,597
I'm in over my head.

1060
01:23:41,598 --> 01:23:46,598
Someone I know killed a man.

1061
01:23:47,312 --> 01:23:49,897
And...

1062
01:23:49,898 --> 01:23:51,440
I don't know what to do.

1063
01:23:51,441 --> 01:23:53,984
He wants my help and I don't
know if I should give it to him.

1064
01:23:53,985 --> 01:23:58,780
I don't know if it's right.

1065
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:01,492
It's just a mess.

1066
01:24:01,493 --> 01:24:04,536
You let him go.

1067
01:24:04,537 --> 01:24:06,246
What?
Don't help him.

1068
01:24:06,247 --> 01:24:08,457
I can't, Mom.
He's my best friend.

1069
01:24:08,458 --> 01:24:11,460
Listen to me.

1070
01:24:11,461 --> 01:24:16,423
The most important thing your
father ever did was fail me.

1071
01:24:16,424 --> 01:24:21,424
You understand?

1072
01:24:51,334 --> 01:24:53,919
<i>He loved you.</i>

1073
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,589
<i>And the truth is, once,</i>

1074
01:24:57,590 --> 01:25:02,135
<i>you loved him back.</i>

1075
01:25:02,136 --> 01:25:03,345
What about
what I need?

1076
01:25:03,346 --> 01:25:05,847
<i>But the secret
ate away at you.</i>

1077
01:25:05,848 --> 01:25:09,851
I was a kid, and you dragged
me into your perverted mess.

1078
01:25:09,852 --> 01:25:12,479
<i>So in Chicago,
you tried to kill yourself.</i>

1079
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,065
How can you say that?
You know that's not true.

1080
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:16,817
He <i>rescued you.</i>

1081
01:25:16,818 --> 01:25:19,319
I will never give up on us.

1082
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,697
<i>He saved your life.</i>

1083
01:25:21,698 --> 01:25:26,698
You're pathetic.

1084
01:25:34,419 --> 01:25:39,419
<i>You needed him
as much as he needed you.</i>

1085
01:25:45,972 --> 01:25:49,933
Now I know how you felt.

1086
01:25:49,934 --> 01:25:54,934
When?

1087
01:25:55,189 --> 01:26:00,189
When you wanted to die.

1088
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:09,699
Do it.

1089
01:26:15,168 --> 01:26:20,168
Do it.

1090
01:26:41,569 --> 01:26:43,487
Ah!

1091
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:59,461
Some things,

1092
01:26:59,462 --> 01:27:02,756
<i>once you've loved them,</i>

1093
01:27:02,757 --> 01:27:07,636
<i>become yours forever.</i>

1094
01:27:07,637 --> 01:27:12,637
<i>And if you try to let them go</i>

1095
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:18,772
<i>they only circle back
and return to you.</i>

1096
01:27:18,773 --> 01:27:23,773
<i>They become part
of who you are.</i>

1097
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:33,199
"Or they destroy you."

1098
01:27:37,291 --> 01:27:38,834
You can't show this to anyone.

1099
01:27:38,835 --> 01:27:40,335
Then tell the truth, Lu.

1100
01:27:40,336 --> 01:27:41,420
You weren't even there.

1101
01:27:41,421 --> 01:27:46,421
It's your truth. It's fiction.

1102
01:27:48,136 --> 01:27:53,136
You wanted him gone, too.
You sent him to me.

1103
01:27:54,892 --> 01:27:56,893
Please.
You'll kill me with that.

1104
01:27:56,894 --> 01:27:58,186
Allen. No.

1105
01:27:58,187 --> 01:28:01,064
Allen! Don't. No!

1106
01:28:01,065 --> 01:28:02,649
Don't!

1107
01:28:16,873 --> 01:28:20,542
Um...

1108
01:28:20,543 --> 01:28:21,960
Allen Ginsberg.

1109
01:28:21,961 --> 01:28:26,961
He'll be with you in a minute.
Please have a seat.

1110
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:39,700
Mr. Ginsberg,
he's ready for you.

1111
01:29:39,789 --> 01:29:44,789
Mr. Ginsberg?

1112
01:29:45,628 --> 01:29:50,628
How did you expect us
to react to this?

1113
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:57,138
No, please, tell me.

1114
01:29:57,139 --> 01:30:02,139
Professor Steeves says that you
submitted it as your final.

1115
01:30:03,813 --> 01:30:06,022
Well, then let me tell you.

1116
01:30:06,023 --> 01:30:11,023
It's smutty and it's absurd.

1117
01:30:11,445 --> 01:30:16,445
But you finished it.

1118
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:19,619
You have taken incompletes
in two classes

1119
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,080
and you are on
academic probation.

1120
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:24,583
There are rules
that you agreed to

1121
01:30:24,584 --> 01:30:26,543
upon acceptance
into this university

1122
01:30:26,544 --> 01:30:30,672
and you managed to break and
you just keep breaking them.

1123
01:30:30,673 --> 01:30:32,966
You don't seem
to have much respect

1124
01:30:32,967 --> 01:30:35,468
for this institution.

1125
01:30:35,469 --> 01:30:38,138
So, you may either

1126
01:30:38,139 --> 01:30:41,057
retract this fiction
as your final

1127
01:30:41,058 --> 01:30:44,311
or you may choose
to be expelled.

1128
01:30:44,312 --> 01:30:49,312
What Will it be?

1129
01:30:55,072 --> 01:30:59,284
Fine.

1130
01:30:59,285 --> 01:31:03,330
Consider me expelled.

1131
01:31:03,331 --> 01:31:08,331
No, this remains with us.

it would never come for you</i>

you haven't changed</i>

1157

<i>You're looking rough
and living strange</i>

1158

<i>And I know you got
a taste for it, too</i>

1159

huh, did you say?</i>

1166

that song at the Death Disco</i>

1168

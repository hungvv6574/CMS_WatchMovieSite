1
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:17,084
Jacob!

2
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:19,085
What are you up to?

3
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,530
Watch this guys!

4
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,991
Fire!

5
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,113
Hey!

6
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:17,164
- Hey get down!
- Fuck!

7
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:25,385
Jacob!

8
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:28,345
Jacob!

9
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,420
We're talking about school
suspension this time.

10
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:07,090
Six months at Rawlins.

11
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,143
Sheriff Armstrong says if you
cooperate he might consider.

12
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:11,444
I was the only one.

13
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:15,702
- Don't bullshit me.
- I don't rat on my crew.

14
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:22,363
Look at me!

15
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:31,475
You almost dragged
your brother in all this.

16
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:35,405
Is that what you wanted?

17
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,506
Take responsibility Jacob.

18
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:53,908
Alright.

19
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,090
- It's gone.
- Fuckin' asshole!

20
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:22,911
Jacob!
- Let me go!

21
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:24,751
Jacob!

22
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:27,392
Step back, Jacob!

23
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,323
How am I supposed to ride?

24
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,433
By getting your act
together, that's how.

25
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:37,823
Mom gave it to me, and I hate you...

26
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:41,155
so fucking much.

27
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,395
'The fuck you lookin' at?

28
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:07,799
Look I didn't mean
to push you like that.

29
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:48,494
I will take
ownership for my actions.

30
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:51,435
And the consequences
of those actions.

31
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,006
Again.

32
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:59,406
I will take ownership for my actions.
And the consequences of those actions.

33
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:01,797
You've got something to say, son?

34
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,768
We're all ears.

35
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,038
'Just been here first week, I'm gonna
cut you some slack, alright?

36
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:21,039
Son, you got it easy
on this side of the fence.

37
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
You understand?

38
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,800
You get to go home at night,
sleep in your warm snuggly bed.

39
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,980
But you best start giving a dam.

40
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:33,490
Else you'll wind up over there
in Juvie with the big boys.

41
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:37,091
'You sure as hell ain't going
home to your mommy and daddy.

42
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,251
You'll be locked up.

43
00:06:39,252 --> 00:06:42,753
Crying and pissing
yourself to sleep every night.

44
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:45,032
On the ground.

45
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,033
Gimme 50.

46
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:52,334
Now!

47
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:56,604
Again.

48
00:06:56,605 --> 00:07:01,476
I will take ownership for my actions.
And the consequences of those actions.

49
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:03,275
Again.

50
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:08,417
I will take ownership for my actions.
And the consequences of those actions.

51
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,220
Come on, let's go.

52
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:39,931
In your bed.

53
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:53,663
Hey, go back to sleep, alright?

54
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,940
Triple-D's, holy shit!

55
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,160
Hell, I'd give her the "D".

56
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:58,341
Like that one?

57
00:09:58,342 --> 00:10:01,271
Hey, put that shit away.

58
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:05,392
It's all good. -He's my fucking
brother, get up you're going home.

59
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:09,483
I wanna stay with you guys.
- I said no, go!

60
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:14,993
'Hear about that kid Ray Martin
got stabbed in Juvie last year?

61
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,994
Fuckin' died, man.

62
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:23,454
Who's next?
- Me go home.

63
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:25,456
Sorry, little man.

64
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:29,276
Let me have some.
- Get your own bag!

65
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:35,846
He's gotten way faster.
- Oh yeah.

66
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:38,207
Yeah, he has.

67
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:46,708
You should totally race again.
- Yeah, I know.

68
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,798
Holy shit look, more at Linden.

69
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,798
Hey girls!

70
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,449
More at Linden.
- God dam!

71
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,449
'Things I would do to that.

72
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,450
You talk to her or what?

73
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,200
I don't know.

74
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,730
Show us your tits!
- WTF Lance!

75
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,730
Talk to the ladies it's all good.

76
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,941
They're leaving, great going!

77
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:09,961
Come on don't be like this, come back.
- Fucking idiot, dude.

78
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,172
Gimme a sec.

79
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:15,262
Well, well, well.

80
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:18,492
Hey.
- Hi honey.

81
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:21,013
What are you trouble makers up to?

82
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,933
Just hanging out.
- Yah, hangin' out.

83
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,125
It's all we're doing, I swear.
- Where's your dad?

84
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,945
Pff! 'Fuck if I know.

85
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:36,886
You know, you're getting yourself
quite a reputation around here.

86
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,886
Come on Jacob.
- Hey, Jacob.

87
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:45,287
Hey, whatever.

88
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:53,279
Dude, she's hot. -Shut up.
-It's his aunt.

89
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:16,301
Get over here and sit down.
- I'm not hungry.

90
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,461
You gotta eat somethin'.

91
00:12:18,462 --> 00:12:21,143
Don't make me get up outa this chair.

92
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:40,695
Here.

93
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,946
Come on.

94
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:50,537
Dad was out in Galveston today.
- Wes.

95
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:55,428
I'm taking another
crack at the place.

96
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:59,818
God, destroyed it for a reason.

97
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:06,379
We're gonna move there.
- Wes, eat your dinner.

98
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,719
I'm not moving there.

99
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Sit down.

100
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:21,291
Dick!

101
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:24,592
What was that?

102
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:38,414
How many times you' gonna
play that stupid song?

103
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:41,814
Leave your brother alone.

104
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:47,525
Wes, come on, sit up.

105
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:48,103
Hey, Wes, get up.

106
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,374
Come on.

107
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:53,155
Wes, let's go.

108
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,096
Hurry up.

109
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,216
Alright, let's go.

110
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,260
It's all you.

111
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:39,092
Look, you're the one who
wanna be part of the crew.

112
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:44,283
He ain't gon' do it.
- Shut up.

113
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:10,456
Holy shit, he did it.

114
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:15,337
Shit.
- Come on, come on.

115
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,817
We gotta go.

116
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:26,918
Hey, stop right here.

117
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,479
Jacob.
- Let's go, Wes, come on.

118
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,780
Go, go, go.

119
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:45,962
Come on, speed up.

120
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:49,582
Stop.

121
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:57,423
Call the cops Jenks.

122
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:21,146
Look, you can't tell anyone, okay?

123
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:23,147
No one.

124
00:17:27,098 --> 00:17:30,947
It's okay, I swear.

125
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:34,448
I won't let anything happen to you.

126
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:36,449
Hey.

127
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:39,829
You did good, alright.

128
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,529
You're gonna stop crying.

129
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,730
Go to sleep.

130
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:56,242
Jacob.

131
00:17:57,392 --> 00:18:01,302
What if we really went
to Galveston like Mom wanted?

132
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:04,273
I'm not going anywhere.

133
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:20,829
"Would you like to try
our new 'quiet' burger.

134
00:18:20,842 --> 00:18:24,795
- No thanks Ted, I'll just have
an order of crazy fries.".

135
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:27,677
- Hey, you want ham or peanut butter?
- Ham.

136
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,128
"Watch out, there's enough
rat poison in this dip-cone ".

137
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,819
I want some.

138
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
Hey, you asked for ham.

139
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:24,325
Who is it?

140
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,148
Hi boys!

141
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:50,769
I'm Mrs. Roberts and this is
Officer Gardner, how are you doing?

142
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:54,559
It's yours?

143
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,250
No.

144
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:05,270
Well, how about I leave it here
just in case it is.

145
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,570
Whatever.

146
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:09,571
Is your dad home, boys?

147
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:11,571
Why you all here?

148
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:13,982
Let's go inside, come on.
- What do you want?

149
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,013
It's alright.

150
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,546
Look, I told you, yo'all
can't be here, okay?

151
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:48,467
Look, my dad will be back later,
you can come back then.

152
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:05,500
Can I talk to you for a second?

153
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,150
Let's go in here, come on.

154
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,231
Come on.

155
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:20,901
- You can't do this.
- No.

156
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:24,493
Where do they take me, Jacob?

157
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:30,272
I need you to get in the car.

158
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:32,543
Enough.

159
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,544
Come on Jacob, okay.

160
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:37,105
- Come on, you'll be alright.
- Jacob.

161
00:21:37,155 --> 00:21:39,135
It's alright let him go.

162
00:21:45,746 --> 00:21:48,666
Pam, open up.

163
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:52,356
Where is he?

164
00:21:52,357 --> 00:21:55,616
- Calm down.
- Wes, get down here.

165
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:58,797
- Hollis, he's asleep.
- What do you think you're doing?

166
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,138
- You think that was my idea?
- CPS just dumped him on me.

167
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:06,778
And you need to start
getting your shit together.

168
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:08,809
I can't keep playing
baby sitter for you.

169
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,186
I can take care of my boys.

170
00:22:10,187 --> 00:22:12,775
I'm just taking Wes for
a little while.  That's all.

171
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,770
- I can take care of my kids.
- Really, can you?

172
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:21,711
Rebecca would be so
heartbroken and you know it.

173
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:27,612
She loved those boys way too much to see
you abandon them the way you did.

174
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:30,731
You told them.

175
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:32,850
That's what this is about.
You told that case worker?

176
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,051
Back up.
Back up Hollis.

177
00:22:35,283 --> 00:22:37,788
I didn't say a damn word.

178
00:22:41,984 --> 00:22:44,934
Just calm down.

179
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,560
- What did they say?
- Go to bed.

180
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:30,281
- When is he coming back?
- Go to bed Jacob.

181
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:04,605
Hollis!

182
00:24:04,606 --> 00:24:06,726
I ain't troublin' no one.

183
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:08,207
Your neighbors are complaining again.

184
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,631
You gotta turn that music down
and go back inside, son.

185
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:14,007
It's a free country
I can do what I want.

186
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:15,766
Come on man, don't cause
any more trouble, we don't

187
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:18,048
wanna bring you in again
if we don't have to.

188
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,249
It's you?

189
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,649
Huh?

190
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,451
Fuckin' ugly coward.

191
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,930
Hey, you got something
to say to me, Harrold.

192
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:43,441
- You say it to my face.
- Hollis! Hollis!

193
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:46,251
Hollis, that's enough.

194
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:50,343
Going to have to sleep this off.
Come on, let's go.

195
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:53,302
Get your hands off me.

196
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:56,323
- Come on.
- No.

197
00:24:56,324 --> 00:25:00,274
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me.

198
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,755
I'm going!

199
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:08,036
I'm going.

200
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:46,101
My co-worker had it,
sorry about that.

201
00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:51,842
Now.

202
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:56,783
You know I can't be letting a 10 year old
boy go unsupervised like you've been doing.

203
00:25:57,003 --> 00:26:02,994
And trust me, a 13 year old kid on probation
is not our idea of a good care taker.

204
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:06,794
Well.

205
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:12,865
The judge has allowed
you to keep Jacob.

206
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:16,825
But you gotta go to the court
appointed counselor once a week.

207
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:19,955
Make every single court date.

208
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:21,956
Hm.

209
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,247
And stop drinking.

210
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:33,197
We'll give it a month
and revisit the situation.

211
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:36,508
You're just lucky judge
Bradley is a big baseball fan.

212
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:39,579
He said he went to all your games.

213
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,370
Look I know that you and your
family have been through a hard time.

214
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,150
It seems to me that...

215
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,651
you could use a little help.

216
00:26:56,612 --> 00:26:59,560
So you look to me and your
sister-in-law because

217
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:02,632
we're just trying to help
you out, you understand.

218
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:08,123
Hollis!

219
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:22,634
This is just temporary.

220
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:24,636
You know that.

221
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:28,906
It's not like last time, okay?

222
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:36,647
You been practicing your moves?

223
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:41,678
Hum.

224
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:47,659
You're better than me.

225
00:27:58,451 --> 00:28:01,040
Alright, come here.

226
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,041
Here we go.

227
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:07,742
You be good.

228
00:28:08,682 --> 00:28:11,373
- Alright?
- Ok.

229
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:16,783
I love that.

230
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:20,784
Go to bed.

231
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:51,688
Aunt Pam?

232
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,279
Aunt Pam?

233
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,350
- Your okay?
- Can you sit with me until I fall asleep?

234
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:07,851
Yeah of course.

235
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:27,063
You want me to read you a story.

236
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:31,054
Or I could actually make one up.

237
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:37,695
You can just sit in that chair.

238
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,659
"I wanna come home."

239
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,210
- Turn it down there!
- You turn it down.

240
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,561
- I wanna come home
- Move.

241
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:31,723
- You there?
- Aha!

242
00:30:38,524 --> 00:30:41,914
You remember when Carmichael won 24 motos?

243
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:45,085
Like before you were even born?

244
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:50,245
And like, after he hurt his knee,
he won all 24 again.

245
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:52,246
Yeah.

246
00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:56,256
He's like an American
hero you know.

247
00:30:56,257 --> 00:30:58,257
I mean who doesn't
respect that guy?

248
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:03,937
"Bookstore is closing soon."

249
00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:05,937
- I gotta go.
- Wes.

250
00:31:06,138 --> 00:31:07,939
<i>What?</i>

251
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:11,309
I'm gonna make it right, okay?

252
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,590
Okay.

253
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,800
Who's that?

254
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:23,901
Jacob.

255
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:29,442
Alright, kid, come on.

256
00:31:35,463 --> 00:31:38,932
<i>You know Ricky just has to drive,
he wasn't afraid of the work.</i>

257
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:42,693
<i>He always trained harder than anyone
else, he's a role model for young ones.</i>

258
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:45,593
<i>He shows them you get out of life
whatever you put into it.</i>

259
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:48,595
<i>But you can't hide in a motocross
world, that's crazy.</i>

260
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:50,798
<i>Every time he goes out
there he's thinking about</i>

261
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:54,485
<i>nothing else but cross that
finish line first.  And he does.</i>

262
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:14,613
- Go!
- Awesome.

263
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,390
Oh nice little job!

264
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:32,611
- That dude is awesome.
- Oh yeah!

265
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:38,902
Go Jacob.

266
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,281
Jacob!

267
00:32:42,282 --> 00:32:45,022
- You alright man.
- Take the helmet off.

268
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:48,402
- You took that corner way too fast.
- No shit.

269
00:32:48,403 --> 00:32:50,404
Come on get up.

270
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,373
Faster.

271
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:56,774
I wanna go again.

272
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:59,144
- Are you sure?
- Yes, fuckin.

273
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,795
I turned too quick.

274
00:33:05,136 --> 00:33:08,765
- So, you talked to Lorne yet.
- Yeah, I talked to her yesterday.

275
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:11,816
- What did she say?
- I don't know.

276
00:33:11,817 --> 00:33:13,926
- You on date?
- Yeah.

277
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:16,326
Since when?
- Since yesterday.

278
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,247
Where did you guys go?
- We really didn't go anywhere.

279
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,177
There's your house but
- What do you mean nowhere?

280
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,468
- No where.
- Wait.

281
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,168
So you haven't been on a real
date yet, like your dating.

282
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:29,288
Yes it's been one day,
how can we go anywhere?

283
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:32,699
- You're not dating her then.
- Take her to your house.

284
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,079
- Have you gotten anywhere yet.
- Nope.

285
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,721
- I would have done it in the first 20min.
- Shut up man.

286
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:44,872
- Anyway she invited me to this
kid's party Saturday night
- It's a rich kid's party.

287
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:50,051
- It's nice, like it?
- Yeah.

288
00:33:50,052 --> 00:33:51,852
Was this 250?

289
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:56,092
- Yeah.
-How much?
- Way too much. That's how much.

290
00:33:56,093 --> 00:33:57,627
My mom is baking a chocolate
cake tonight, for

291
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,983
Tim's birthday if anyone
wants to come over.

292
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:03,613
I can't, my parents wanna
have some bullshit big talk.

293
00:34:03,614 --> 00:34:05,434
That sucks.

294
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:08,594
I thought Tim and your mom broke up.

295
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:12,806
She took him back, fucking dick,
treats her like crap.

296
00:34:14,806 --> 00:34:17,996
You remember that one time when your
mother kicked me outa the house?

297
00:34:17,997 --> 00:34:22,697
Your mom wouldn't take shit from
no one, she was so fuckin cool.

298
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,367
Look Jacob, I'm sorry man.

299
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:28,768
Whatever, just go.

300
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:38,459
Hey, do you hear Bailey's
renovating that bowling alley?

301
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,859
- Yeah?
- Yeah man.

302
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,871
- Saturday night specials, baby.
- We're the worst in the league.

303
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:50,831
Me, you, Rebecca.

304
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:53,691
Janey Donovan.

305
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,841
That girl had an ass on her.

306
00:34:55,842 --> 00:34:58,992
Every time she grab that pink little
ball and bowl walk up to that line.

307
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:01,432
I'm about hurt myself.

308
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:05,163
I still got that last place
trophy Rebecca made us.

309
00:35:05,164 --> 00:35:07,754
She always said we're the
best to be the last.

310
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:10,424
Yeah.

311
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:16,035
She sure did

312
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:28,257
Mind if say something?

313
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:35,497
Why don't you sell this place, man?

314
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:38,368
She'd want you to let it go.

315
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:44,139
This ain't the dream home she
thought it was gonna be you know.

316
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:58,660
You owe me a 6-pack.

317
00:35:58,661 --> 00:36:01,991
Shiyea' who's helpin who here boy?

318
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:05,182
Seriously where's my saw at?

319
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:26,615
Hey Jacob!

320
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:29,846
Wes here?

321
00:36:32,476 --> 00:36:36,837
I don't think it's a good idea
that you all hang out right now.

322
00:36:41,758 --> 00:36:45,687
Look, I'm gonna win a bike
race next month.

323
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:48,439
You gonna see me at nationals this year.

324
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,518
You know who Ricky Carmichael is?

325
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,518
I don't.

326
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,769
That's really great!

327
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:59,040
Your mom would be real proud of you.

328
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:04,401
Look, can I at least come
in hang out with him?

329
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:11,742
Not today  I'm sorry.

330
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:35,415
Come on.

331
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:38,456
Hey Jacob get in here.

332
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:57,349
What's wrong?

333
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:05,649
You wanna go get some
ice-cream after the game.

334
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,419
We can celebrate.

335
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,281
Celebrate what?

336
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:18,002
I got the back deck finished finally.

337
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:25,353
- Fuck Houston.
- Watch your language.

338
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,636
Don't go in my room.

339
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:58,907
If you change your mind let me know.

340
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:00,728
Dad!

341
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:26,321
My best friend at school
he told me a joke.

342
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:30,442
Yeah?
What is that?

343
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:33,912
You got 30 cows and 28 chickens.

344
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:39,243
- How many didn't?
- How many didn't?

345
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:41,244
I don't know.

346
00:39:43,295 --> 00:39:48,814
There are 30 cows and 28 chicken.
How many didn't?

347
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:53,616
Didn't what?

348
00:39:56,976 --> 00:39:59,986
- That's the punch line?
- No.

349
00:39:59,987 --> 00:40:05,077
There are 30 cows and 28 chickens.

350
00:40:05,078 --> 00:40:07,427
I don't know what you're saying.

351
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:09,987
I wanna know the joke.

352
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:15,408
There are 30 cows, twenty
'eight' chicken.

353
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:20,329
There's only 30 cows,
28 chickens, okay.

354
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:24,218
There are 30 cows, twenty
of them 'ate' chickens.

355
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:28,855
Ahh!
20 cows ate the chickens.

356
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:38,442
"I must confess he said that
I found it very difficult to row".

357
00:40:38,443 --> 00:40:41,582
For so long a time,
though I assure you.

358
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:44,453
I did my best and did not
spare my strength.

359
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:48,253
I noticed that though the wind
blew strong in my face,

360
00:40:48,254 --> 00:40:51,394
the current continued
to carry us out".

361
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:59,385
Aunt Pam, you should
probably go to bed.

362
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:02,686
Yah you're right.

363
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:08,477
- I love you.
- Love you.

364
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,049
- Hey.
- Hey.

365
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,510
Shhh, get your shoes on.
Let's go.

366
00:41:39,142 --> 00:41:43,042
Wes don't be a pussy, let's go.

367
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:52,443
He's getting cosy.

368
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:54,644
Lucky him.

369
00:41:56,094 --> 00:41:58,493
Hey, that could be us
in a few seconds.

370
00:41:58,494 --> 00:42:01,235
So gross.

371
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:04,665
Katy! Katy?

372
00:42:05,515 --> 00:42:07,626
No shit?

373
00:42:21,258 --> 00:42:24,427
Have you been in that
old bookstore on 12th?

374
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:27,168
There's like this whole
section on pirates.

375
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,398
And that weird guy Max was there.

376
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:33,089
He would show me these
old rap records.

377
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:38,559
She's just trying to buy your love
and your too dumb to realize it?

378
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,600
You'll like aunt Pam, she bought your bike
helmet and took care of us when dad left.

379
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:46,050
You're just jealous cause
she took me to Six Flags.

380
00:42:46,051 --> 00:42:51,262
As if I could give a shit about
Six Flags, your stupid pirate bookstore.

381
00:42:55,413 --> 00:42:58,433
She's not your mom.

382
00:43:06,074 --> 00:43:07,725
You miss her?

383
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:14,025
I miss dad.

384
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:53,901
Did you grab the field trip slip?

385
00:44:07,763 --> 00:44:10,633
Huh, I'm sorry uh.

386
00:44:10,634 --> 00:44:13,513
I'm really late I've a 5:30
with Carla Raines.

387
00:44:13,514 --> 00:44:18,155
I'm sorry Mr. Wilson she had
to leave she waited 45min for you.

388
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,895
Call us back in the morning.
We'll re-schedule, okay?

389
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,996
- Yes ma'am.
- Okay.

390
00:44:34,727 --> 00:44:37,687
I just saw the case,
it kinda spoke to me.

391
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:39,807
- Well.
- Said "buy me!".

392
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:43,028
- Looks nice.
- It's badass cheap.
- It's a good purchase.

393
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:46,568
Wait Anders.  Are you're talking about that
girl you were with last night, or that gun?

394
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:48,869
- That gun.
- She was a bargain.

395
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:53,749
From the bargain bid, she was a little
husky, she was a good deal for him.

396
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,890
Very funny.

397
00:44:56,691 --> 00:44:59,270
You know Danny that new kid
at the barber shop.

398
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:03,511
Just got himself a Smith & Wesson
model 10.  It's a beaut' man.

399
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:05,611
- I might be better at this than him.
- Hell yeah.

400
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:09,892
Hey Capes, watch where you point
that thing, we gotta kid in here.

401
00:45:09,993 --> 00:45:14,083
- Are you talking about Jackie-boy?
- Uh.

402
00:45:14,903 --> 00:45:17,514
Jackie-boy, are you a kid?

403
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:21,693
- You ever held a gun?
- Why man, I own no guns.

404
00:45:21,694 --> 00:45:23,894
He's gotta learn sometime, right?

405
00:45:23,895 --> 00:45:26,704
- We gotta make a man outa him.
- That's not the way to do it.

406
00:45:26,705 --> 00:45:30,725
- Alright, get outa that armpit boy.
- Come on Jackie-boy, you're up.

407
00:45:30,726 --> 00:45:32,325
Have a seat.

408
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:34,546
Do it Jackie-boy.
Come on.

409
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,927
It ain't even loaded, man.

410
00:45:37,987 --> 00:45:40,635
Alright Jacob, grab that
with your right hand,

411
00:45:40,648 --> 00:45:42,807
now you cradle the butt right
here with your left hand.

412
00:45:42,857 --> 00:45:45,208
"Cradle the butt".

413
00:45:45,258 --> 00:45:48,917
This is an advice that'll
work all year round now.

414
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:51,898
You keep this tight like that,
push it tight.

415
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:55,578
Now when you go in ready to fire
you just drop that in like that, okay?

416
00:45:55,579 --> 00:45:57,879
"Booo", squeeze it don't pull.

417
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,469
That's enough, give it back Jacob.

418
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,719
Dad it's fine.

419
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,200
Come on man, he's already got a record.
- Alright.

420
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:07,570
- Alright.
- Go hang out in your room.

421
00:46:07,571 --> 00:46:10,161
- Alright Jacob.
- Night Jackie-boy.

422
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:13,482
- One last.
- No, I'm good.

423
00:46:17,613 --> 00:46:19,732
These are the precious moments.

424
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:23,842
- They don't come back.
- These are the precious moments.

425
00:46:23,843 --> 00:46:26,013
You're right.

426
00:46:26,014 --> 00:46:30,534
What, I'm serious

427
00:46:35,805 --> 00:46:38,446
Alright, come on.

428
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,926
It's time to get up.

429
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:45,286
Hey, get up, get dressed.
Put your shoes on.

430
00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:48,256
I need you ready in 10 minutes, okay?

431
00:46:48,257 --> 00:46:50,857
'Serious Jacob.

432
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:05,329
Just hold. 37 hold.

433
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,430
Ready!

434
00:47:20,432 --> 00:47:24,602
Come on, Wes.

435
00:47:25,693 --> 00:47:27,513
Go, go, go.

436
00:47:29,963 --> 00:47:31,693
Hold on, Wes.

437
00:48:08,149 --> 00:48:10,989
Wes, hey.

438
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,679
That was really good!

439
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,340
- You saw the game?
- Yeah, whole thing.

440
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,991
How are you doin' Hollis?

441
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:25,131
Alright.

442
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:28,761
That was really great.

443
00:48:29,162 --> 00:48:31,621
- Thanks.
- Hm.

444
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:34,123
That was really good, man.

445
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:39,632
Alright, we better get going, we're gonna
meet some of the families for pizza.

446
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:44,713
Hey, we can meet you guys there,
we don't got anything goin' on.

447
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:48,334
Maybe I d meet your team, hm?

448
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:51,525
I don't think that's a good idea.

449
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:54,725
What do you mean?

450
00:48:54,726 --> 00:49:00,055
I don't think that's a good idea right now
with everything that's been goin on, okay?

451
00:49:00,056 --> 00:49:03,726
Just because some damn court saying
you play mommy for a few weeks.

452
00:49:03,727 --> 00:49:06,227
- Don't mean I get...
- Not in front of the boys, okay?

453
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:15,959
I'm his father.

454
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:27,340
Alright, come here.

455
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:29,741
Gimme a hug.

456
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:36,131
I'm real proud of you,
and I love you.

457
00:49:36,132 --> 00:49:38,972
You know that right?
- M-hm.

458
00:49:45,053 --> 00:49:49,253
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

459
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:53,594
Okay, hey, you be good.

460
00:49:55,775 --> 00:49:58,905
Alright, come on kiddo.

461
00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:11,694
Easy in this corner here,
you slow in that corner.

462
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,194
- I don't know about that but
- You're going outside, then you take inside.

463
00:52:15,195 --> 00:52:17,295
- Come on man let me see it.
- Shut up.

464
00:52:17,296 --> 00:52:20,295
- Hey, you see that Carmichael move?
- That was awesome.

465
00:52:20,296 --> 00:52:22,935
- Let me see it.
- Chill out.

466
00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:25,156
- He's so fricking fast.
- Stop.

467
00:52:25,157 --> 00:52:29,396
- You fuckin dick.
- Oh shit, Lance.

468
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:32,597
Shhhhit!

469
00:52:32,598 --> 00:52:35,288
Come on.
- It's over let's go.

470
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:38,849
- Get off him.
- You got it come on.

471
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:45,450
You're lucky.

472
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:50,440
Your friend Lance here
takes full blame.

473
00:52:51,721 --> 00:52:55,780
I don't wanna see you boys
back in this park ever.

474
00:52:55,781 --> 00:53:00,522
This is a public place for little
kids, not a bunch of teenage punks.

475
00:53:05,923 --> 00:53:08,183
Alright, go on.

476
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:14,093
Nathan, except you get back over
here, and sit down.

477
00:53:14,094 --> 00:53:16,683
Lance you too.

478
00:53:16,684 --> 00:53:19,085
Rest of you get outa here.

479
00:53:31,106 --> 00:53:35,026
Lance's parents are getting a divorce.

480
00:53:35,027 --> 00:53:37,626
That fuckin sucks, man.

481
00:53:37,627 --> 00:53:42,197
Yeah, Charlotte told me Lance's dad
was having an affair with Nathan's mom.

482
00:53:42,198 --> 00:53:43,594
How the hell would Charlotte know?

483
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,830
Her mom ***.
She probably knows everything.

484
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:50,689
Fuckin hate cops.

485
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,630
- Man, your dad's gonna kick your ass.
- Shut up.

486
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:11,311
That's not like mom's but.

487
00:54:11,312 --> 00:54:13,313
Hm.

488
00:54:19,353 --> 00:54:21,074
What?

489
00:54:22,374 --> 00:54:25,053
You washed my uniform?

490
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,055
It's on your bed.

491
00:54:30,855 --> 00:54:33,815
Where did you get the shiner?

492
00:54:33,816 --> 00:54:36,106
Some kid at the park.

493
00:54:36,116 --> 00:54:38,496
You hit him back?

494
00:54:40,937 --> 00:54:42,887
Good.

495
00:54:46,307 --> 00:54:48,918
Where did you get the girl make up?

496
00:54:50,298 --> 00:54:52,668
Andrew's sister.

497
00:54:55,649 --> 00:54:57,878
She used to tell us about that...

498
00:54:57,879 --> 00:55:00,180
kid from the Burger Palace.

499
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,820
He got his face bashed in so bad in
Juvie, he couldn't talk for a month.

500
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,470
It's why he's got the weird scar.

501
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,621
Hm.

502
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:17,292
I saw the kid who got stabbed
and died like two months ago.

503
00:55:18,822 --> 00:55:23,123
Well, I guess it's best you
stay out there then, uh?

504
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:27,274
Hey.

505
00:55:28,474 --> 00:55:31,004
You gotta do better.

506
00:55:40,225 --> 00:55:44,436
The qualifier for nationals
is in two weeks.

507
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:50,107
Good.

508
00:55:56,068 --> 00:55:58,907
Hey, we need the video camera

509
00:55:58,908 --> 00:56:03,609
- Yeah Lance, get some clothes on.
- Just open the door?

510
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:09,140
Hey man, you're grounded?

511
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,289
You come out?

512
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:14,991
My brother's taking us to the track.

513
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:20,690
- Hey man, where's your mom?
- Shit, I don't know.

514
00:56:20,691 --> 00:56:25,511
- So you wanna come or...
- I said I don't wanna fucking go,
now take the camera.

515
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:27,712
Jesus.

516
00:57:30,382 --> 00:57:35,482
Alright, I'm gonna be right
back here to pick you up, okay?

517
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:28,230
What do you want Pam?

518
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,090
I need to talk to you.

519
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,391
It's important.

520
00:58:38,212 --> 00:58:45,433
So, I got offered a job,
a couple days ago in Houston.

521
00:58:48,133 --> 00:58:53,353
And I've been giving
it a lot of thought.

522
00:58:53,354 --> 00:58:56,654
And I'm gonna take it.

523
00:58:57,474 --> 00:59:00,884
You remember how much we all wanted
to get out of here when we were kids?

524
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:04,435
And you guys always had Galveston.

525
00:59:07,316 --> 00:59:13,766
So Wes's lawyer told me that
you missed counseling.

526
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:17,226
<i>So she's advising me that it is...</i>

527
00:59:17,227 --> 00:59:19,367
in Wes's best interest...

528
00:59:19,368 --> 00:59:21,887
that he come with me to Houston.

529
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:24,848
Get out of my house.

530
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,888
Get out!
Get out!

531
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:31,179
Wait, Hollis.

532
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:37,129
<i>Jacob's gonna end up in Juvie and
you know it, and then what?  Wes too?</i>

533
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:40,490
Next time you come back over
here, you'll be bringing him home.

534
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:42,590
I just want what's best for him.

535
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:45,311
Travis left 'cause
you didn't want kids.

536
00:59:45,312 --> 00:59:47,911
You never wanted kids, Pam.

537
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:50,952
Why the hell are
you tryin' to take mine?

538
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:11,785
Dad!

539
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:40,550
<i>Hi you've reached Pam...
and Wes.  Leave us a message.</i>

540
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:45,209
Hey Wes, this is Jacob.

541
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,411
Just call me back okay?

542
01:01:08,138 --> 01:01:09,873
Look at this jackass.

543
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:13,735
You're gonna win this shit, man,
the cat's in the bag.

544
01:01:15,483 --> 01:01:18,663
I heard about Robert Ramirez, he put
some kid in the hospital yesterday, dude.

545
01:01:18,664 --> 01:01:23,668
He wasn't in the hospital but,
I think he's messed up pretty bad.

546
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,544
They took Robbie in handcuffs.
- Shit.

547
01:01:27,545 --> 01:01:29,537
'You seen it?

548
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:39,629
Have you seen Wes lately?

549
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:41,729
Nope.

550
01:01:49,328 --> 01:01:51,579
You got this, man.

551
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,980
You'll win the whole race.

552
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:01,318
I have to.

553
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:15,492
- You've seen my belt?
- No.

554
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:16,652
Damn.

555
01:02:21,865 --> 01:02:24,884
Find that nice tie mom got you?

556
01:02:24,885 --> 01:02:27,904
Yes, it's right here.

557
01:02:29,005 --> 01:02:31,805
I don't know how to tie it.

558
01:02:31,806 --> 01:02:35,246
- She always did for me.
- I know.

559
01:02:36,147 --> 01:02:38,283
Come here.

560
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:42,870
Lift up your chin.

561
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:44,871
Here you go.

562
01:02:57,743 --> 01:02:58,927
Here.

563
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,671
It's good.

564
01:03:07,032 --> 01:03:09,488
<i>I'm not dragging you in here with me.</i>

565
01:03:10,576 --> 01:03:13,208
<i>You boys are.</i>

566
01:03:14,096 --> 01:03:18,857
<i>I'm not threatening you with
anything, I'm trying to keep what.</i>

567
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:22,593
<i>like you said there are children and
I gotta keep every other weekend.</i>

568
01:03:25,509 --> 01:03:30,362
- Come on.
- What 'they say? Dad where's Wes?

569
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,545
Jacob.

570
01:04:00,467 --> 01:04:02,835
We'll get him back.

571
01:04:13,948 --> 01:04:15,774
Wes!

572
01:04:15,775 --> 01:04:18,875
What are you doing here?
- Why you never call me back?

573
01:04:18,876 --> 01:04:21,725
- What's that?
- I don't know.

574
01:04:21,726 --> 01:04:25,005
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I don't know.

575
01:04:25,006 --> 01:04:28,195
Look, I'm gonna race next week.

576
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:30,195
Alright?

577
01:04:30,196 --> 01:04:33,469
I'm gonna win for you and dad,
whole town's gonna see it.

578
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:37,756
- Okay.
- I need you to be there, okay?

579
01:04:37,757 --> 01:04:39,756
You gotta tell Pam.

580
01:04:39,757 --> 01:04:41,237
Wes?

581
01:04:43,562 --> 01:04:45,454
Let me go.

582
01:05:06,191 --> 01:05:09,431
Hey mom's still at her bridge club,
you wanna come in for a cold one.

583
01:05:09,432 --> 01:05:12,695
I gotta get back.

584
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,159
Everything's gonna work
out just fine, man.

585
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,559
What 'you worried about.

586
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,543
Yeah.

587
01:05:22,775 --> 01:05:24,309
Put some clothes on.

588
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:27,944
You scaring the kids.

589
01:05:49,073 --> 01:05:52,338
You alright with riding this one?

590
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:57,065
Well, come on.
Get in.

591
01:06:08,486 --> 01:06:10,035
<i>If you're just pulling
in at the front gate</i>

<i>We got race number 3 loading

<i>Open amateur class for 85cc

597
01:06:28,423 --> 01:06:32,748
<i>Everyone's trying to earn their way to the
Texas amateur all-star amateur nationals.</i>

598
01:06:32,749 --> 01:06:36,523
<i>Top 12 qualifiers, and today's
qualifying race.</i>

599
01:06:36,524 --> 01:06:39,523
<i>Again race number 3 at the starting line.</i>

600
01:06:39,524 --> 01:06:42,948
<i>Right now race number 3 is on...</i>

601
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:10,021
Yeah Jacob.

602
01:07:10,022 --> 01:07:12,015
Jacob wooo.

603
01:07:24,786 --> 01:07:30,807
The 45 are about to enter the first
turn here at cow-boy Badlands MX park.

604
01:07:34,827 --> 01:07:39,703
<i>Again the top 12 qualify for
the Texas amateur all-star.</i>

605
01:07:44,296 --> 01:07:48,480
<i>Jacob Wilson now starts to put up a
little bit of pressure running up front.</i>

606
01:07:52,488 --> 01:07:54,608
Jacob.

607
01:07:55,109 --> 01:07:58,233
<i>Gary Owens also appears.</i>

608
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:06,116
<i>Couple of laps in, here we go with
Gary Owens, Jacob Wilson and Jason.</i>

609
01:08:05,817 --> 01:08:06,600
Come on.

610
01:08:06,601 --> 01:08:09,321
<i>All three frontrunners here...</i>

611
01:08:13,118 --> 01:08:15,848
<i>And Jacob Wilson now
takes over the lead.</i>

612
01:08:15,649 --> 01:08:16,805
Good, good, good.

613
01:08:16,806 --> 01:08:19,968
<i>We gonna have Gary Owens
on our thrilling...</i>

614
01:08:24,506 --> 01:08:29,315
<i>Owen makes the pass,
puts Jacob Wilson over the berm.</i>

615
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:47,092
Is Wes here?

616
01:09:49,206 --> 01:09:50,414
No.

617
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:57,928
Come on.

618
01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:01,865
Hey, you were great.

619
01:10:12,973 --> 01:10:15,222
Okay.

620
01:10:15,886 --> 01:10:18,215
Anything else I can get you boys?

621
01:10:18,216 --> 01:10:20,998
- I think that's it, thank you.
- You're welcome.

622
01:10:20,999 --> 01:10:22,996
- And a coke.
- Yeah sure.

623
01:10:25,802 --> 01:10:26,906
Here you go.

624
01:10:29,002 --> 01:10:34,284
Your mom would be real proud of you.

625
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,902
Proud of a reject Juvie kid?

626
01:10:43,575 --> 01:10:46,272
Close your mouth when you eat.

627
01:10:48,873 --> 01:10:52,019
- Real nice.
- Hyder.

628
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,846
So?

629
01:10:55,847 --> 01:10:59,780
- How is school boys?
- I hate school.

630
01:10:59,781 --> 01:11:01,779
It's fine.

631
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:05,870
This whole thing's a joke.

632
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:09,170
Dad of the fucking year over here.

633
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:13,352
- Not here.
- Why not uh?  Everyone
knows CPS took your kid.

634
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:15,352
Whole town knows.

635
01:11:15,353 --> 01:11:18,143
- Shut your mouth now.
- They don't know about Galveston.

636
01:11:18,144 --> 01:11:21,304
- That's enough.
- He fucking left us.

637
01:11:21,305 --> 01:11:23,765
- Stop.
- Don't tell me what to do.

638
01:11:23,766 --> 01:11:27,966
It wasn't my responsibility
to take care of everything.

639
01:11:27,967 --> 01:11:31,598
Take care of Wes while
you boozed up down there.

640
01:11:31,599 --> 01:11:33,600
Alright, come on.

641
01:11:35,056 --> 01:11:39,420
3 weeks dad, 3 whole
weeks you were gone.

642
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:43,501
Admit it, you wanna
drink yourself to death.

643
01:11:43,502 --> 01:11:46,752
Cause when Duncan found you, you were
gonna leave us for good, weren't you?

644
01:11:46,753 --> 01:11:50,323
- Let's go.
- We're not leaving.

645
01:11:50,324 --> 01:11:53,795
- Enough now.
- Now what are we supposed to do uh?

646
01:11:53,796 --> 01:11:56,746
How are we supposed to get him back?

647
01:11:56,747 --> 01:12:01,167
This is all your fault.
This whole thing is your fault.

648
01:12:01,168 --> 01:12:04,818
You wanna play that game?
You really wanna go there?

649
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:08,058
Take a hard look at yourself, son.

650
01:12:08,059 --> 01:12:10,050
Come on, let's go.

651
01:12:10,051 --> 01:12:13,972
Get your hands off me.

652
01:12:13,973 --> 01:12:16,813
Don't touch me.

653
01:12:29,682 --> 01:12:32,065
Fuck all of you.

654
01:12:37,932 --> 01:12:39,901
Come on.

655
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:46,343
I left money on the table.
I'm sorry about this.

656
01:14:21,727 --> 01:14:24,503
One of these .

657
01:14:42,832 --> 01:14:45,885
Get another one.

658
01:14:50,392 --> 01:14:51,408
Get it.

659
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,446
Nice one.

660
01:14:59,258 --> 01:15:01,811
- Let me see that thing.
- No, you'll burn yourself.

661
01:15:01,812 --> 01:15:03,808
- Come on, give me
- Stop.

662
01:15:05,809 --> 01:15:09,799
- Hyder, stop.
- Would you give me the friggin lighter.

663
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,970
Jacob let me do it.

664
01:15:13,371 --> 01:15:16,302
Don't hit anyone, Hyder.

665
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:19,657
Just shut up.

666
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,305
The retard's gonna hit his own face.

667
01:15:30,306 --> 01:15:34,349
- Shut up you asshole.
- Holy shit no more house arrest.

668
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,743
Gimme the bat, let me
show you how it is done.

669
01:15:38,744 --> 01:15:40,939
Alright.

670
01:15:44,861 --> 01:15:46,494
Hold that for me.

671
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:47,738
Fuck you.

672
01:15:48,818 --> 01:15:52,371
- Stop being such a little bitch.
- Lance stop motherfucker, quit it.

673
01:15:52,483 --> 01:15:54,240
- Obviously it's you.
- Fuck you.

01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,135
- Don't be a pussy just hold on.
- Stop Lance, this isn't funny.

675
01:15:57,136 --> 01:16:00,245
- Get it away from me.
- Stop Lance.

676
01:16:00,246 --> 01:16:01,303
Fuck you.

01:16:04,308 --> 01:16:06,600
What the fuck is he doing?

678
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,801
What the hell?

679
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:12,003
Cut it out man.

680
01:16:28,615 --> 01:16:30,628
Jacob, what are you doing?

681
01:16:30,629 --> 01:16:32,726
- Stop Jacob.
- Leave me alone.

682
01:16:32,727 --> 01:16:35,716
- Will you stop?
- Fuckin go away.

683
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:38,899
- Stop.

684
01:16:40,571 --> 01:16:42,349
Get the fuck off me.

01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:44,773

686
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:50,635
- Get the fuck off me.
- Get off of Jacob.

687
01:16:50,636 --> 01:16:52,552
Get off him.

688
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:08,980
I was supposed to protect him.

689
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,989
She's taking him to Houston.

690
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:17,536
Fuck that bitch.

691
01:17:18,557 --> 01:17:21,141
Come on, man, get up.

Let's get outa here.

Yeah.

695
01:17:46,321 --> 01:17:48,329
Alright.

696
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,902
I saw your probation report
signed on your bed.

697
01:17:51,903 --> 01:17:56,819
Mr. Dominguez said that you'll be back
at Barker sooner than you thought.

698
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,815
I'm real proud of you.

699
01:18:00,794 --> 01:18:03,029
You hear what I said?

700
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:05,027
Yeah.

701
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,611
What?

702
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:19,012
I don't know, you just...

703
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:22,061
You look like her sitting there.

704
01:18:27,442 --> 01:18:30,366
We made a great team didn't we?

705
01:18:30,367 --> 01:18:32,366
The four of us.

706
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:16,509
Hey Wes, get up.

707
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,855
Come on.

708
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:21,000
What are you doing here?

709
01:19:21,001 --> 01:19:23,687
Hurry up, pack your things let's go.

710
01:19:23,688 --> 01:19:25,683
Why?

711
01:19:26,546 --> 01:19:28,330
We're leaving.

712
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:30,779
What?

713
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:34,004
Hurry up, get your shoes.

714
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:40,442
- Man, what's taking him so long.
- I don't know.

715
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:42,739
- "In and out".
- Shut up.

716
01:19:43,459 --> 01:19:46,015
- Don't mess with that man.
- Shut up.

717
01:19:49,345 --> 01:19:51,489
- Lance knock it off.
- Shh.

718
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:53,883
Put it back.

719
01:20:01,325 --> 01:20:03,345
I can't go anywhere.

720
01:20:03,346 --> 01:20:06,405
It's not a choice, Wes.

721
01:20:06,406 --> 01:20:08,407
Grab your books.

722
01:20:11,952 --> 01:20:14,469
Hurry up, get your shoes.

723
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:18,794
Hey where's your jacket,
the really good jacket?

724
01:20:25,177 --> 01:20:26,813
Holy shit.

725
01:20:28,734 --> 01:20:30,430
Lance.

726
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:34,296
Cut it out, Roger.

727
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:37,393
Roger, put it back.

728
01:20:38,177 --> 01:20:39,713
What?

729
01:20:45,563 --> 01:20:47,612
The fuck was that?

730
01:20:54,478 --> 01:20:56,767
I'm going up there.

731
01:21:00,128 --> 01:21:03,624
- You stay down here.
- Stay down.

732
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:06,218
- Quiet.
- Don't fuck up come on.

733
01:21:15,981 --> 01:21:18,509
Where the fuck did you get that?

734
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,647
Your dad's house.

735
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:28,041
Go, go.

736
01:21:41,413 --> 01:21:43,199
She's asleep.

737
01:21:46,749 --> 01:21:48,248
- Drop the bat.
- Lance.

738
01:21:48,249 --> 01:21:51,840
- Sit the fuck down.
- What the hell are you doing, Lance?

739
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:54,175
- Put that gun down.
- Are you okay, man.

740
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,595
- Oh shit Hyder.
- Is he okay, roger?

741
01:21:56,596 --> 01:22:00,083
- Well, I hope he's okay, bitch.

742
01:22:03,445 --> 01:22:06,972
- This bitch hit Hyder.
- No, I didn't know it was him.

743
01:22:06,973 --> 01:22:08,665
Where the hell did you get a gun?

744
01:22:08,666 --> 01:22:12,057
- Stop talking.
- Lance.

745
01:22:12,058 --> 01:22:14,820
- What are you doing?
- She's gonna call the cops,
man, we're all going to Juvie.

746
01:22:14,821 --> 01:22:16,926
- I'm not calling anybody.
- Sit the fuck down.

747
01:22:16,927 --> 01:22:19,098
- Jacob.
- Lance, chill out.

748
01:22:19,099 --> 01:22:21,319
Shut the hell up, sit back.

749
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:24,428
Lance I got it chill out.

750
01:22:25,496 --> 01:22:26,804
Okay.

01:22:27,053 --> 01:22:30,032
- What are you doing.
- I'm sorry.

752
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:32,673
What are you doing, Jacob stop.

753
01:22:32,674 --> 01:22:34,844
Stop that, stop fighting him.

754
01:22:34,845 --> 01:22:38,666
Quit moving, quit moving.

755
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:42,096
Quit moving, lay the fuck down.

756
01:22:42,097 --> 01:22:44,778
It's okay, it's okay.

757
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:47,558
What are you doing?

758
01:22:47,559 --> 01:22:50,480
You think it's okay what you did?

759
01:22:50,481 --> 01:22:53,253
You gonna wake the fuckin neighbors.

760
01:22:54,129 --> 01:22:55,313
Lance!

761
01:22:55,361 --> 01:22:58,902
You're a fucking bitch,
breaking a perfectly good family.

762
01:22:58,903 --> 01:23:01,196
- Cut it out, man.
- ...outa here, I don't feel good.

763
01:23:01,197 --> 01:23:03,914
- Just chill out.
- Get the fuck over there.

764
01:23:03,915 --> 01:23:06,507
- Let it go.
- You're breaking up a family.

765
01:23:06,508 --> 01:23:08,702
You have a clue how fucked up that is?

766
01:23:08,703 --> 01:23:10,194
Do you?

767
01:23:12,152 --> 01:23:13,686
Why don't I shoot you now, huh?

768
01:23:13,687 --> 01:23:17,605
- Lance stop! We're fucking leaving.
- You think you're so tough?

769
01:23:17,606 --> 01:23:20,299
- Lance, stop.
- Please.

770
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,920
- You fucking bitch.
- Lance, hey.

771
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:25,823
Calm down.

772
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:29,091
Get off me.

773
01:23:29,192 --> 01:23:32,533
- Lance.
- Get off me.

774
01:23:32,534 --> 01:23:35,115
Get off of him...

775
01:23:46,342 --> 01:23:47,814
Shit!

776
01:23:49,799 --> 01:23:52,953
Get up, cops are coming.

777
01:23:57,461 --> 01:23:59,162
Let's go.

778
01:24:13,003 --> 01:24:15,967
What's going on?

779
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:20,057
Wow, hey, say that again?

780
01:24:33,045 --> 01:24:34,310
Pam!

781
01:24:50,783 --> 01:24:53,796
- What the hell happened?
- It wasn't Jacob's fault.

782
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:58,560
He was trying to protect
everybody, and Lance was just...

783
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:02,712
I got the boy off to the town
hospital, he's gonna be fine.

784
01:25:02,713 --> 01:25:06,016
You have any idea where
these boys might have gone?

785
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:07,761
I don't know.

786
01:25:08,761 --> 01:25:11,514
The detectives out there want you
both to come at the station.

787
01:25:11,515 --> 01:25:13,606
Are you kidding me Walter?

788
01:25:13,607 --> 01:25:16,491
My kids are out there, scared and alone.
I'm not going to any of your dam station.

789
01:25:16,492 --> 01:25:20,557
- When they find them,
they're bringing them in.
- They're fucking kids.

790
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:28,388
- What's he doing?
- He's just staring at me.

791
01:25:30,648 --> 01:25:32,072
Let's go.

792
01:25:42,152 --> 01:25:45,149
Hyder!  Hey, stop!

793
01:25:49,438 --> 01:25:50,558
Stop.

794
01:25:51,238 --> 01:25:53,151
Hey, Hyder.

795
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:56,196
Stop, where are Wes and Jacob?

796
01:25:56,197 --> 01:25:58,190
Uh? Where are they?

797
01:25:58,191 --> 01:26:00,892
The beach.

798
01:26:24,189 --> 01:26:25,209
Hey, how long?

799
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:29,976
Has to be about at least another 30
minutes before it gets back over here.

800
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,092
Okay, we'll be back.

801
01:26:33,593 --> 01:26:34,439
Let's go.

802
01:26:43,243 --> 01:26:45,905
You remember when mom used
to take us here to wait?

803
01:26:52,523 --> 01:26:55,889
We start over in Galveston.

804
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:58,540
Just like she wanted.

805
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:04,974
It will be like .

806
01:27:04,975 --> 01:27:06,973
The Swiss family Wilson or something.

807
01:27:14,018 --> 01:27:16,570
I'll take care of you, okay?

808
01:27:22,509 --> 01:27:24,069
Come here.

809
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:50,373
Walk in on the left boys.

810
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,445
Are you OK?

811
01:28:15,589 --> 01:28:16,703
Yeah.

812
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:25,628
- Hey, you see 2 boys get on
- Get on, you need to get on.

813
01:28:25,629 --> 01:28:28,416
- 2 boys 10 and 13?
- You need to get on.

814
01:28:33,184 --> 01:28:36,757
- 2 boys 10 and 13, did they go on.
- Yes, they're on there somewhere.

815
01:28:39,774 --> 01:28:41,270
Wes.

816
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:44,376
Jacob.

817
01:28:45,647 --> 01:28:46,864
Wes.

818
01:28:48,752 --> 01:28:50,242
Jacob.

819
01:28:56,298 --> 01:28:58,076
Wes.

820
01:29:04,286 --> 01:29:06,052
You alright?

821
01:29:06,053 --> 01:29:08,566
Uh? Are you OK?

822
01:29:10,087 --> 01:29:11,864
I got you.

823
01:29:13,425 --> 01:29:15,081
I got you.

824
01:29:20,979 --> 01:29:22,171
Are you OK?

825
01:29:27,694 --> 01:29:30,173
Come here.

826
01:29:37,064 --> 01:29:39,818
It's okay, shhh.
- I'm sorry.

827
01:29:42,258 --> 01:29:46,415
I screwed up, me.

828
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:49,733
I never should have left you boys.

829
01:30:36,795 --> 01:30:39,269
Look at me.

830
01:30:41,261 --> 01:30:43,902
Look at me.

831
01:30:48,215 --> 01:30:50,720
I love you more than anything.

832
01:30:51,408 --> 01:30:53,970
You understand me?

833
01:30:59,315 --> 01:31:05,932
Everything is going to be okay.

834
01:31:44,043 --> 01:31:49,121
Wes, let me out I feel sick.

835
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:05,575
You're okay?

836
01:32:09,052 --> 01:32:11,894
Stay with dad, okay?

837
01:32:17,179 --> 01:32:21,029
Stay with him, understand?

838
01:32:23,957 --> 01:32:28,533
Promise me you'll take care of him.

839
01:32:42,538 --> 01:32:47,613
Alright boys, come on.

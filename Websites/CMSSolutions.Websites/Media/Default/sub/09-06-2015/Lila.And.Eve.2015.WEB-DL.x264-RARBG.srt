1
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,416
God, grant me the serenity

2
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:56,427
to accept the things
that I cannot change...

3
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:59,661
Nah, man. back off.
I'm about to be there.

4
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:02,473
Yo, she's not feeling you
like that, dude.

5
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:06,409
The courage to change
the things that I can...

6
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:07,993
Nah, it's Stephon.
You know what I'm saying?

7
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:09,460
Just tell her I said I'm coming,

8
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,819
and everything's
gonna be all good.

9
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:23,668
And the wisdom to know
the difference.

10
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,939
I'm gonna return Ben's dish.

11
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:02,121
And he said
he'll take me to school.

12
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,255
He said he'd take me
the rest of the week

13
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,623
so you could rest, okay?

14
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,116
Okay.

15
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:08,228
Mom.

16
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,464
You should take this.
Wear it.

17
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,937
No.
No, no, Justin.

18
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:15,480
You don't have to do that.
Mnh-mnh.

19
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:18,280
- I promise it will help.
- Justin, no.

20
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,193
You go to school.
It's okay.

21
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:22,068
It's okay.

22
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:53,272
Please, help me.

23
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,697
And before you eat
another piece of cake,

24
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:57,858
open your brother's gift.

25
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,546
Mmm.

26
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:01,997
Nice wrapping, Justin.

27
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:03,438
Cool, right?
Mm-hmm.

28
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:06,072
Well, you did use
a lot of tape, dude.

29
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:13,243
A new watch?

30
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,315
What do I need with a new...

31
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,170
It's real nice.

32
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,027
- It's real shiny.
- Mom helped pick it out.

33
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:26,305
It's kind of
from the both of us.

34
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,539
Okay, I get it.

35
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,353
I was late again,
so a new watch.

36
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:32,426
That's not it.
Open my gift.

37
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,530
Okay.

38
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:38,988
- No.
- Good looking out, ma.

39
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:41,671
Look again.
Look again.

40
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:53,799
- Oh, man!
- Ooh!

41
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,434
- Come on!
- The city got new ones,

42
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:56,962
so I got a really good one
second-hand.

43
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,863
Stop playing.
Come on, now.

44
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:01,983
Oh, man.
This is great.

45
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,493
It has a little camera, too.

46
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:05,700
So when you go off to college,
Mom will get us another computer

47
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,312
so we can see you
<i>and</i> talk to you.

48
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,547
I thought you might like it.

49
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,517
And we could put it right here.

50
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,654
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,589
I thought you got it
just for me.

52
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,065
I did get it for you.

53
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,956
Yeah, but it's like
I got to sign for it

54
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,680
before I can use it
or something.

55
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:23,047
Dude, come on now.

56
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:29,492
All I'm saying is
I'm a man now.

57
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:47,463
I feel good.

58
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:48,937
Well...

59
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:52,763
Not exactly good, I guess.

60
00:04:53,987 --> 00:04:56,722
I ran into this old picture
of Charles

61
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,848
in the back of a drawer.

62
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:04,856
It felt good, the memory,
instead of painful.

63
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:08,645
He's a cutie.

64
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:12,701
If you want the truth,
that is one sweet face.

65
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:17,749
So I feel like
I'm getting there.

66
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:20,461
I'm getting to accept
God's will.

67
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,006
Oh, and I brought y'all some of
my lemon squares for the break.

68
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,163
They were his favorite.

69
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:27,390
Thank you, Patrice.

70
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,137
Go ahead, girl.

71
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:34,466
So, we're mothers.

72
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:38,137
Our maternal instinct
is to protect our child.

73
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:40,643
And when the worst happens,

74
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:44,133
when that child is murdered,

75
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:47,393
we feel guilt, depression,

76
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:49,848
we feel we failed.

77
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:55,087
We lose our homes, our minds,
and sometimes our lives.

78
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,149
So get a sponsor.

79
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:02,928
Find someone
that you can talk to,

80
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,565
Get out, get a hobby,

81
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:10,145
get to acceptance somehow

82
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,041
so that you can get on
to living, right?

83
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:20,798
Now, I think I see a new face.

84
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:32,465
I'm Lila Walcott.
I'm... here.

85
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,238
I work for the city.

86
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:38,569
I was a clerk in public records.

87
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:40,532
I...

88
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:44,020
Now I'm on leave.

89
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,216
My son Stephon was m...

90
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,171
Step back, please, ma'am.
Ma'am?

91
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,721
- Stephon...
- I need you...

92
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,918
- Stephon!
- You can't come in here.

93
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,227
It's alright.
You don't have to say it.

94
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,795
You take your time.

95
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,265
Stephon?
Stephon, are you with us?

96
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,281
Can you hear me?

97
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:05,633
STEPHON !

98
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:09,113
I'm not gonna say that word.

99
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,396
You shouldn't say it.
It's okay.

100
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,591
I hear y'all, but, um...
Stephon is dead, and I...

101
00:07:20,393 --> 00:07:22,388
I want to...

102
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:26,936
You want him back.

103
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,680
Finish, Lila.

104
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:35,327
You want... what?

105
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,084
To thank y'all for inviting me.

106
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,593
You're welcome.

107
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:06,148
Did you get a hobby yet?

108
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,191
Your son's dead,
and they tell you

109
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:10,489
to start collecting stamps
or something.

110
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,058
Well, they're just trying
to help.

111
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,487
Yeah, it's funny
how everyone wants to help

112
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:15,608
when there's nothing
they can do.

113
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,959
I keep getting cards, you know?

114
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:21,918
First from the detective
and the reverend.

115
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:23,697
Just got another one in there.

116
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:27,271
Maybe that could be your hobby,
collecting cards.

117
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:29,083
Or getting advice.

118
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,576
Oh, yeah.

119
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,829
I had this interior-design job.

120
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:36,569
And my boss said to me,
real nice,

121
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,250
"you can have another kid."

122
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,314
I think I heard that one.

123
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,588
"Well, at least you have
another son."

124
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,187
Like I had one to spare.

125
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:47,151
Telling you, man.

126
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:49,683
Talk is meaningless.

127
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,303
Tell me about yours.

128
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:56,657
Then I'd be talking.

129
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:58,141
You know,
they said to get a sponsor,

130
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,775
someone to talk to,
and, uh, if you're interested...

131
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,798
In being yours?

132
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:09,133
That's... that's sweet,
but not smart.

133
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:11,816
This is... this whole thing
is not my scene.

134
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,631
Just being here makes me feel
fucking useless.

135
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,277
Well, wait a minute.
Maybe give it a chance.

136
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:19,295
I really feel like
I can talk to you.

137
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,292
Ah.

138
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:32,934
Here's my number, but it's
not me you should be calling.

139
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,229
Well, I've called the police,
but...

140
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,748
What about you?
Did they find the person...

141
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:38,461
They barely even looked.

142
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:40,621
My little girl,

143
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:44,082
she wasn't real to them.

144
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:46,318
So you know how it is.

145
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:48,815
We think about her all the time,
but nobody else does.

146
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,183
They don't think about us.

147
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:54,227
Hell, they don't even<i> see</i> us.

148
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:57,661
I'll keep on it.
I'll keep calling.

149
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:01,075
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

150
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:26,816
- Ma'am?
- You know what? I've had a seat.

151
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,727
Now I've had enough.
I've been waiting for an hour.

152
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,198
Is detective Holliston even here?

153
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:31,310
Ma'am, I paged him.

154
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:33,026
Would you like
to leave a message?

155
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:34,866
Detective Holliston!

156
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:36,095
Can I help you?

157
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,943
I called about my son's case,

158
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:40,238
and no one got back to me,
so I thought I'd come down.

159
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,251
Uh, wh-wh-what case
is it again?

160
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:46,715
Y-you don't...
You don't remember me?

161
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:48,051
Sure, I do.

162
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:49,967
It's just I've got
a lot to keep track of.

163
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:51,229
Tell me again.

164
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:52,362
- Ms. Walcott.
- Yeah.

165
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:53,808
- You're here for an update.
- If you wouldn't mind.

166
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,237
Uh, we canvassed the neighborhood,
but, sorry to say, nothing yet.

167
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:57,528
We're just gonna
have to keep looking

168
00:10:57,553 --> 00:10:58,690
till we get the break
we need, ma'am.

169
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,208
My son was just walking
down the street.

170
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,097
I have another son.
What am I supposed to do?

171
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:04,331
If it were me,
I'd move.

172
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,709
Ms. Walcott.
Ms. Walcott, listen.

173
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,604
There's more.
Just, uh...

174
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:11,752
Can I speak to you
for a minute?

175
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:16,314
Here's what we know.
We attained a lot.

176
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:19,944
Uh, essentially, every corner
is a piece of property.

177
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,014
And every piece of property
has a landlord.

178
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,728
You work the corner,
you pay rent.

179
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:25,051
We see it a lot.

180
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:28,202
This guy ray,
he was freelancing.

181
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:29,825
They warned him,
they didn't warn him,

182
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,880
we don't know.

183
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,747
What we do know is
that somebody driving by

184
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:36,025
in a black S.U.V. took him out.

185
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,395
Who did?
Who... who are they?

186
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,424
Nobody will tell us anything.

187
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,573
We see it a lot, too.

188
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:44,836
We need evidence.

189
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,479
One lead,
one name.

190
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:50,352
- Without that...
- You'll forget all about it.

191
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,268
So, I went to the police.

192
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:06,291
And they don't know anything,

193
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,964
and they're not trying
to know anything.

194
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:13,577
I can't stop thinking about it,
you know?

195
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:16,545
I mean, this is something
that goes way past

196
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,228
any kind of pain I ever felt
or experienced.

197
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:25,043
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

198
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:28,037
I just...

199
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:33,756
I wanna...

200
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,230
- We all know what you want.
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:38,133
You want to hold him again.

202
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:40,164
Yeah.
You want your son back.

203
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:43,352
- That's right.
- You want the ones responsible.

204
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:45,035
You want peace.

205
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,325
You want to hear his voice.

206
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,561
You want a good night's sleep.

207
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,300
You want them to know
how it feels.

208
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,452
I mean, we all live here, right?
And we shut it out somehow.

209
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:58,621
But I can't anymore.

210
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:00,979
Can you?

211
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:04,045
God, grant me the serenity

212
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,118
to accept the things
that I cannot change,

213
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,221
the courage to change
the things that I can,

214
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,538
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

215
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:15,550
Wisdom to know the difference.

216
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,046
Age doesn't make a man, Stephon.

217
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,881
Well, you treat me like
I'm 8 years old.

218
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,111
A... a real man
keeps his word

219
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:41,389
and he is where
he's supposed to be

220
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:43,517
when he's supposed to be.

221
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,572
That's what I know.

222
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,267
Fine.

223
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,410
I'll call next time if you want.

224
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,592
I do want.

225
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:54,933
Because I know you don't want me

226
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,797
to go out there looking for you.

227
00:13:56,822 --> 00:13:58,340
Like that would ever happen.

228
00:13:58,365 --> 00:13:59,424
Yeah.

229
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:02,079
Yeah, and wipe your mouth,
Jay-z.

230
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:04,424
Wipe all the cake
off your mouth.

231
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:06,507
Jay-z.
Oh.

232
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:09,802
Thank you.

233
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:13,626
Thanks, ma.

234
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,004
� After this time �

235
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,774
� I feel you �

236
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,804
Here I am,
reporting for sponsor duty.

237
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:49,199
- Thanks for coming.
- Uh-huh. I know.

238
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:51,035
I mean it.

239
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:54,267
Just came to see
if you're okay.

240
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,552
Yeah. no.

241
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:58,952
I-I don't know
what I am.

242
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:04,607
Well, it's like
a hospital in here.

243
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:06,440
- Mm.
- Needs a...

244
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:11,253
cheer this place up
with some color and strength.

245
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:13,552
Like Tina Turner strength.

246
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,855
Although that sister did put up
with some serious bullshit.

247
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,016
- Mm.
- You seen Ike?

248
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,581
Girl, he's a little skinny man.

249
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:22,098
Like Somalia skinny.

250
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,618
I mean, the first time
he raised his hand,

251
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:27,127
she should have
just broke him in two.

252
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,464
Used them legs on him.

253
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,306
So, you went
to see the police?

254
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:38,948
Mm-hmm.

255
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,134
Feel better?

256
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:46,391
I feel... forgotten.

257
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:49,349
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

258
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:52,919
Well, I'll give you a tip.

259
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:55,339
Stop cleaning.

260
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:57,745
Oh, well, that goes back
to when I was a little girl

261
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,680
and I would hear
my folks fighting.

262
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:00,959
I'd straighten up and clean

263
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:02,488
as a way
of making things better,

264
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:04,851
feeling in control.

265
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,333
You know what they said?
Get a hobby.

266
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:07,448
Why don't you
fix the place up?

267
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:09,148
Shit, give it a facelift.

268
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:11,783
You know, I used to be
an interior decorator.

269
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:13,901
I can help you.

270
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:15,444
I don't know.

271
00:16:15,469 --> 00:16:17,551
I'm going back to work
next week part time.

272
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,137
I don't know if I want
to be spending money

273
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:20,692
fixing this place up.
Oh, please.

274
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:23,067
It won't cost nothing
to pull up this nasty-ass carpet

275
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:24,557
and burn it with the trash.

276
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:28,086
It was here when I moved in.
I never much liked it, but...

277
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:30,032
Let's pull it up.

278
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,763
You know, sometimes,
they got some real nice

279
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:34,212
hardwood floor underneath here.

280
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,366
Right here in the corner.

281
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:38,359
I don't know why Justin
keeps his book bag...

282
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,165
See? It's already peeling up
here in the corner.

283
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:55,249
Oh my god.

284
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,256
Oh, my god.

285
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:04,583
You know, maybe he was...
Maybe he was scared.

286
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,974
Maybe he was angry.

287
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:10,353
Maybe he just wanted
to protect you.

288
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:12,778
Why...
Why would...

289
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:15,333
Why... Why would he do...
Do something like that?

290
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,616
What is he supposed to do?

291
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:20,184
His big brother gets killed,

292
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,469
and the guys who did it,
they're still out there.

293
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:24,905
Well, I can't do anything
about that.

294
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,752
But what if you could?

295
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:28,873
Would you?

296
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,014
Of course I would.
Who wouldn't?

297
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:40,559
You know, with my little girl,
it was just like you.

298
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:44,973
They told me I couldn't
do anything, to wait.

299
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,724
So I waited.

300
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:53,539
And nothing happened.

301
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,881
Come on.

302
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:05,220
What?

303
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:07,002
Trust me.

304
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:09,549
Justin's asleep in his bed.
He's safe.

305
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:12,635
Let's go for a ride.
I want to show you something.

306
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,398
It's over there, right?

307
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:27,457
That's where Stephon was...

308
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,354
And they got another dealer
out there just like that.

309
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,162
He's got to be working
for somebody.

310
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,930
Denzel's on the trail
of a kidnapper in this one.

311
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:40,954
I got my own movie to go to.

312
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:42,461
Who are these friends?

313
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:44,005
You met them before.

314
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,623
There's some I haven't met.

315
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,518
Oh, and you're never
gonna meet those.

316
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,536
Yeah.

317
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,130
They'd call this house
day and night

318
00:18:50,155 --> 00:18:52,156
when you were in eighth grade.

319
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:55,543
Hi.
Can I please speak to Stephon?

320
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,680
So, what's up with you
and that neighbor Ben, huh?

321
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,081
The plumber man.

322
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,575
Alright.
Alrighty.

323
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,904
These friends
you're meeting tonight,

324
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:03,808
is any of them
your regular girl?

325
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,957
Nah-ah. They all know
who my regular girl is.

326
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:07,787
Oh, please.
I'm not falling for that one.

327
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,424
That's just so whack.

328
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,211
Whack?
You...

329
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:13,822
- Whack!
- Please don't start using my words.

330
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:15,812
Alright. have fun.
What time is it?

331
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:17,122
Please. I'm 18.
Come on.

332
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:21,337
I don't care if your 18.
11 o'clock, please, Stephon.

333
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,167
- Peace, Just.
- See you, Stephon.

334
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:28,199
Alright.
You, me, and Denzel, baby.

335
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,076
Yeah.
Like always.

336
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,907
Detective said he needs a name.

337
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:38,650
Let's get one.

338
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,233
"Let's get one"?
Let's go home.

339
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:41,623
No.

340
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:45,538
At the meeting, you started
to say what you wanted.

341
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:55,299
I just want justice for the
ones who took my son.

342
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,301
So let's get it.

343
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:06,601
I just can't go over there
and ask.

344
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:09,448
It's a street.
It's crowded.

345
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,686
You know what?

346
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:14,434
Everyone goes home sometime.

347
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:30,133
That's him.

348
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:34,601
Hey.
The twins ain't here.

349
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:36,970
I got the food.
I'm coming home.

350
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:39,680
What makes you think
he'll tell us anything?

351
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,616
No. no.
What if someone...

352
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,187
- We can't!
- We won't.

353
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:47,318
Not unless we have to.

354
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:50,216
If I want to eat my french fries
on the way home, I'm gonna.

355
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:52,517
No.
What are you gonna do?

356
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:55,166
I guess I'll get
my Tina on.

357
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:04,427
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

358
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:05,802
Yo. Yo.

359
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:08,230
Don't come up on nobody
like that.

360
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:09,880
Just got a question.

361
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:13,218
- Do I know you?
- No, but you know Ray.

362
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,506
What's it to you if I do?

363
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,695
What you want from me, huh?

364
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,386
A name.

365
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,444
The corner that you work,
there was a drive-by last month.

366
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:23,352
Someone's responsible.
That name.

367
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:25,010
Look.
Get the fuck out my face.

368
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,768
I want a name!

369
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,840
Is this a joke?

370
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:31,496
I want a name!
Give me that name right now

371
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:32,917
or I swear I'm gonna shoot...

372
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:34,041
Oh!

373
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:36,311
Ohh!
Ohh!

374
00:21:37,498 --> 00:21:39,367
What did you do?

375
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:40,957
What was I supposed to do?

376
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:43,365
You saw.
He came right at me.

377
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,728
He's somebody's child.

378
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,011
He tried to kill us!

379
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:51,086
Come on.
Let's go.

380
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:52,537
Go!

381
00:21:57,752 --> 00:21:59,383
All we wanted was a name.

382
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,967
But we did get one,
didn't we?

383
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:02,754
Donelle Peete.

384
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,333
I mean, it's not the right name,
but it's a lead.

385
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,691
And his phone.

386
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:08,457
His phone's gonna have
more names.

387
00:22:08,482 --> 00:22:10,451
We can leave a tip
for that detective.

388
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:11,662
He'll know my voice.

389
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:14,511
He didn't know your face!
He won't know your voice.

390
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,427
Look. I know
you're freaked out right now.

391
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,452
But I know you feel lighter.

392
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:36,498
Stephon.

393
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:39,895
Wake up.

394
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,507
Wake up.

395
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:45,996
Don't leave me yet.

396
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,599
You hear me?
You don't leave me yet.

397
00:22:48,874 --> 00:22:50,851
You don't leave your mama yet.

398
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:52,702
Okay?

399
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,776
Now wake up.

400
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,348
You wake up, Stephon.

401
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:02,984
You hear me?

402
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:04,824
You hear me?

403
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:07,297
You breathe.

404
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:12,828
Wallet's gone, watch isn't.

405
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,474
Rolex.

406
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,927
The shooter left a Rolex?

407
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,681
The dummy also left
a pocketful of pills

408
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:20,736
containing a felonious substance.

409
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:22,503
Felonious?

410
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:24,390
I catch you with that
big-word dictionary again,

411
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:26,236
I'm gonna beat you
to death with it.

412
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:27,942
Where the hell's forensics?

413
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:30,130
You know the drill.
It's the ghetto.

414
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:32,758
That means they get here
when they feel like it.

415
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,226
Can't blame them.
It's a simple ATM case.

416
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:37,641
Insert gun, pop, pop, pop,
extract cash.

417
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,660
He took a cellphone
and left the drugs?

418
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,981
And no shell casings anywhere.

419
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:44,790
- Got to be a revolver.
- No, I got it.

420
00:23:44,815 --> 00:23:46,524
It's the conductor
of the symphony orchestra,

421
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,954
and he hid the casings
in his opera cape.

422
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:50,100
Smart ass.

423
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,495
Columbo got it done.

424
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,930
Yeah, Columbo's old as shit.

425
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,932
No. that's what
he wants you to think.

426
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,100
So while you're busy
making fun of him,

427
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,451
he's solving the crime.

428
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:59,069
No, no, no. I-I get the
whole theme of it,

429
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:01,509
but I'll be the first one to tell
you, the shit don't hold up.

430
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:03,484
Saw it on TV Land last night.

431
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:06,710
Lots of, uh, guys in plaid
jackets and wide-ass ties.

432
00:24:06,735 --> 00:24:08,045
Is that what you do
when you're not on the job?

433
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,747
TV Land?

434
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:10,966
Don't act like you don't know.

435
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,941
You know-
You know the married life.

436
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:16,161
Like a broken record.
Where the hell's forensics?

437
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:23,868
I'm headed out to school.

438
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,742
I know you're angry
about your brother.

439
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,145
And I am, too.

440
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,265
But, Justin, you will not ever
put your hand on a gun.

441
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,058
You hear me?

442
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,562
- I hear you. but...
- I want your word.

443
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:38,876
It's like I told Stephon,
a man keeps his word.

444
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:40,692
- You got it. But I don't know...
- Just go.

445
00:24:40,717 --> 00:24:42,215
And bring home lots of books
in your backpack

446
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,214
because other than school, you
won't be leaving home for awhile.

447
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,146
Got to stay calm.

448
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:01,875
What about the cash?

449
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:04,714
I don't want to have
anything to do with it.

450
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,784
Me neither.

451
00:25:07,481 --> 00:25:10,712
Maybe slip it in the
donation box at the meetings.

452
00:25:12,452 --> 00:25:14,272
I guess we shouldn't waste it.

453
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:15,920
You don't have to worry.

454
00:25:15,945 --> 00:25:18,064
There was nothing in the papers.
They're not looking for us, Lila.

455
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:20,420
But the gun,
it's still...

456
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:22,954
I told you. I'm gonna
take care of everything.

457
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,641
I got it.

458
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:32,533
Did you see
who that call was from?

459
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:35,311
It was a text.

460
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:36,412
What did it say?

461
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:38,167
It said,
"We said J.J.'s.

462
00:25:38,192 --> 00:25:40,848
Usual time. Saturday.
Leo."

463
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,773
Well, that's from
whoever he works for.

464
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:46,035
So, if we go this Saturday at
the same time Donelle was there,

465
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,735
we might find the one
who killed Stephon.

466
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,856
Mm.
Go.

467
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,082
Shit.

468
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:10,283
You have a moment, ma'am?

469
00:26:12,164 --> 00:26:14,091
Sorry.
Do you have company?

470
00:26:14,729 --> 00:26:16,912
Uh, I just haven't picked up.

471
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:19,124
Come on in.

472
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:20,806
Doing some work
on the house, huh?

473
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,467
Yeah.
"Get a hobby," they said.

474
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:25,392
Assholes.

475
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:27,318
Look.
I won't keep you long.

476
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:30,357
I-I just need to take a look
in Stephon's room.

477
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,301
Standard procedure.

478
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:35,180
Oh, come on.
It's right in there.

479
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,663
- Right here.
- Okay. okay.

480
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,082
Like I said, I usually
pick up better than this.

481
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:46,713
Eh, it's okay.
I was a teenager once.

482
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,491
- Albeit, a long time ago.
- Mm.

483
00:26:50,098 --> 00:26:52,405
Can I get you
something to drink? Coffee?

484
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,634
No, thanks.
I'm fine.

485
00:26:54,731 --> 00:26:56,046
Well, I have something
on the stove.

486
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,229
I'll be right back.

487
00:26:57,254 --> 00:26:58,768
Okay.

488
00:27:42,718 --> 00:27:44,353
Thank you, ma'am.

489
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:48,024
You know, I... I saw he liked
to play Splinter Cell.

490
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:50,106
I play that with my nephew
sometimes.

491
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:53,140
I just got it for him. He never
had a chance to play it.

492
00:27:55,101 --> 00:27:56,361
Alright, well.

493
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:58,819
We'll be in touch if
there are any developments.

494
00:27:58,844 --> 00:27:59,894
What were you looking for?

495
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,640
You... said it was about
the corner and the rent?

496
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:06,864
Well, there's certain
evidence-gathering protocol.

497
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:09,577
Like I said, procedure.

498
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:11,129
That's it?

499
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,877
You didn't come here to
investigate anything for real?

500
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:18,365
You're just here to check off
a box by his name?

501
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,795
No, ma'am.

502
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,699
I treat every case
they give me the same.

503
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,937
That's why I follow
the same protocol.

504
00:28:23,962 --> 00:28:25,644
Make sure nothing important
gets missed.

505
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,869
Next time, call first.

506
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:30,715
Don't just show up
to a person's house.

507
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:39,650
I like that.
"Call first."

508
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,777
You got potential.

509
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:44,672
Let's get to work.

510
00:28:44,697 --> 00:28:48,292
� You can walk
into a line of fire in summer �

511
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,952
� Say hoo, hoo �

512
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:57,469
� You got everyone wanting to
know how you do what you do �

513
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,939
� You say
you're starting to sweat �

514
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:05,149
� And the temperature drops �

515
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:11,255
I always loved home-design
magazines and shows.

516
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,598
That's something
I always wanted to do, but...

517
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:16,063
� Well, I'm out here
giving it all I've got �

518
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,292
I don't need more
than one guess.

519
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:21,250
First, I got pregnant.
Then he wanted to marry me.

520
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:23,026
And by the time
Stephon rolled around,

521
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,347
he didn't even know my name.

522
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,564
Home design didn't
even matter after that.

523
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:28,733
You know what I mean?

524
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:30,000
Same type of thing
happened to me.

525
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,188
Except the first time he told me
he didn't want my baby,

526
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:34,212
I told him to go fuck himself,

527
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:36,444
wasn't his anyway,

528
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,921
Then I went and had a pizza.

529
00:29:51,842 --> 00:29:53,125
Hey, Ben.

530
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,327
You feeling alright?

531
00:29:54,352 --> 00:29:55,580
Mm-hmm.

532
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:57,083
Justin said this would be
a good time

533
00:29:57,108 --> 00:29:59,256
to come for my chairs.

534
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:01,022
Hungry?
We got plenty.

535
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:04,055
Are you sure?
I've seen you eat.

536
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,131
Is it okay?

537
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:08,669
Uh, yeah. it's fine.
I'll fix you a plate.

538
00:30:08,694 --> 00:30:10,429
Alright, then.

539
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,055
Justin, how you doing?

540
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,802
I've got an art project
to work on.

541
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:18,529
What?
You just gonna leave?

542
00:30:18,554 --> 00:30:20,245
Oh, alright.

543
00:30:20,948 --> 00:30:23,873
Boy.
Mm-mm-mm.

544
00:30:23,898 --> 00:30:26,869
This looks good,
if I do say so.

545
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:28,382
Well, I didn't make it.

546
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:30,840
Um... oh.

547
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:33,308
This is one of your dishes.
Alright.

548
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,833
My mother taught me this.

549
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,416
Since it's just me,

550
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:39,937
I don't usually want
to make a whole pot.

551
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:42,039
Well, it's very nice of you.

552
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,607
I haven't felt much
like cooking, so...

553
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:46,621
Mm, well.

554
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:50,590
It looks like you've been pretty busy
working hard on this house.

555
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,152
Just let me know
if you need a hand.

556
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:54,641
I can manage just fine.

557
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:58,148
I didn't mean anything, Lila.

558
00:31:01,284 --> 00:31:04,241
I'm sorry.
My nerves are just shot.

559
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:06,029
I just...

560
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,660
I'm gonna go back
to group tomorrow.

561
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:10,057
I don't know what else to do.

562
00:31:11,474 --> 00:31:13,322
I don't know why
things are like they are,

563
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:15,804
why people do what they do.

564
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:19,805
All I know is,
is you'll find your way.

565
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:23,570
Till then, remember to eat.

566
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:25,546
I'm gonna cut this...

567
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:29,628
and give you
a piece of this to eat.

568
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:31,498
There.

569
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:33,369
You got to eat.

570
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:34,881
- Mm.
- See?

571
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,245
- Feel better?
- Mm-hmm.

572
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,715
Uh-huh.

573
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:42,607
Guess we finally had that dinner
I've been nagging you about.

574
00:31:42,632 --> 00:31:43,826
Mm-hmm.

575
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:46,225
I kept asking because...

576
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:48,161
Maybe I shouldn't say.

577
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:50,433
No, no.
No, go ahead.

578
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:54,587
I kept asking because
Stephon told me to.

579
00:31:55,388 --> 00:31:59,567
He said your thing with Denzel,
it wasn't gonna last.

580
00:32:06,045 --> 00:32:07,303
Oh.

581
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:08,830
Thanks for that.

582
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:10,659
Mm-hmm.

583
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:12,569
Yeah.

584
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:18,510
And for helping with Justin,
for everything, 'cause...

585
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:25,107
I work out in the yard a lot.
They're kind of rough.

586
00:32:27,265 --> 00:32:29,349
No, they're not.

587
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:33,799
Okay.
Well, you take care.

588
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:35,280
Okay.

589
00:32:35,305 --> 00:32:37,019
See you soon.

590
00:32:43,455 --> 00:32:45,262
- Hey, Lila. Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

591
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:46,760
Now, did you find a sponsor?

592
00:32:46,785 --> 00:32:48,217
Oh, Patrice said
she was interested.

593
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:49,864
But I have someone.
Eve.

594
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:52,281
That's okay. Look.
Um, hey, Patrice?

595
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,670
Lila just wanted to let you know
that she found...

596
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,209
Hey, I'm sorry.
I can't talk right now.

597
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,277
I got to get home and get
to making my lemon squares.

598
00:32:57,302 --> 00:32:58,651
What's your hurry, Patrice?

599
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,585
Charles is coming home.

600
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,865
He was coming home earlier,
but you know how boys are.

601
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,591
Out there with his friends.

602
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,783
So, I got to get home,
and I got to get ready.

603
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:09,579
Well, did you stop taking
your medicine?

604
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:11,641
Yeah.
I didn't need it anymore.

605
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,813
I found the answer.

606
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:16,973
I found it right here
in the bible.

607
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:20,831
Who raised up his only son
in 3 days?

608
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:23,033
That's what got me.

609
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:25,806
Because if he could raise up
his son,

610
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:27,774
he could raise up mine.

611
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,204
So, that's when
I started to pray.

612
00:33:30,668 --> 00:33:33,506
And I knew my prayer
would be answered.

613
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:36,765
- 3 days, 3 years.
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:40,806
I got to let
the others know.

615
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:43,175
Charles is coming home.

616
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,908
Charles was, uh,
at a barbecue,

617
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,657
and he was trying
to break up a fight,

618
00:33:47,682 --> 00:33:49,077
and he got killed

619
00:33:49,102 --> 00:33:50,799
3 years ago today.

620
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:54,262
Birthdays, anniversaries,
they're the worst.

621
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:55,289
Oh, I'm good today.

622
00:33:55,314 --> 00:33:57,014
Patrice, do you think
you can stay for the meeting?

623
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:57,865
No.
You know what?

624
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,396
This has happened to her before?

625
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:03,943
Not just her.
No, we all have our bad times.

626
00:34:03,968 --> 00:34:06,076
So we look in
on each other,

627
00:34:06,101 --> 00:34:10,080
we, um, we stay over
if we have to.

628
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:12,301
So I'm gonna make sure
that she gets home tonight.

629
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:15,069
And tomorrow,
I will take her...

630
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:20,054
If I lost it,
would I even know it?

631
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:25,385
Am I gonna end up
just like her?

632
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,613
If you stay inside

633
00:34:27,638 --> 00:34:29,599
and you keep it
all in like her,

634
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:31,804
it festers.

635
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,198
You got to do something
about your feelings.

636
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,181
I try to sleep, but...

637
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:46,600
My mind keeps going back
to that corner every time.

638
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:56,989
You been thinking about this?

639
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:59,323
I never stop thinking
about it...

640
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:04,277
About that damn diner
and who he was gonna see there.

641
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,719
I want to see him.

642
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,905
See if he's the one
that took my son.

643
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:15,970
It's Saturday.

644
00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:21,334
In two hours,
it's the usual time.

645
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,775
I think you have to go.

646
00:35:25,528 --> 00:35:27,902
It wouldn't just be for me.

647
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:32,935
I need it just as
much as you do.

648
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:37,984
Then maybe
we can help each other.

649
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:49,583
I guess this is a stakeout.

650
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:53,472
What do cops do
during stakeouts?

651
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:56,453
- Sleep.
- Hmm.

652
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:02,507
In the movies, they talk
about their families.

653
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,696
Is that my cue?

654
00:36:13,122 --> 00:36:15,688
My boyfriend's name is Mello.

655
00:36:16,636 --> 00:36:19,529
He comes from
the land of JELL-O,

656
00:36:19,938 --> 00:36:22,969
� With pickles for his toes
and a cherry for his nose �

657
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:25,985
� And that's the way
my story goes. �

658
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,941
� My boyfriend's name is Billy, �

659
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:31,221
� He come from good, old Philly
with a cherry on his nose �

660
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:33,203
� And 10 big, fat toes, �

661
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:35,358
� And that's the way
my story goes. �

662
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,975
� I gave him back his peaches, �

663
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,762
� I gave him back his pears, �

664
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,491
� I gave him back his 50 cents �

665
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:43,138
� And kicked him
down the stairs �

666
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:49,591
So, your mom taught you that,
too, huh?

667
00:36:49,616 --> 00:36:51,619
- Yeah.
- Mm.

668
00:36:52,468 --> 00:36:55,203
Your little girl
used to do that?

669
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,865
Yeah.

670
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:00,714
I never told anyone,

671
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:03,340
but I always wanted
a little girl.

672
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,790
There they are.

673
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:28,348
Think they killed anybody?

674
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:31,281
I think they killed Stephon.

675
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:32,923
We don't know that.

676
00:37:35,423 --> 00:37:37,412
You know how I feel.

677
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:39,508
We just talk to them.

678
00:37:39,705 --> 00:37:43,187
- Now, last time...
- Last time, you messed up.

679
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:46,801
That's what I was gonna say,
okay?

680
00:37:46,826 --> 00:37:48,403
Last time,
I messed up.

681
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:50,155
So, this time,
it's all you.

682
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,675
If you want to go,
we'll go.

683
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,117
If you want to talk to them,
we'll talk to them.

684
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:55,624
If we get a name for that cop, I'll...
I'll leave the tip.

685
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,373
But it's all you.

686
00:37:58,279 --> 00:37:59,927
I'm going home.

687
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:10,082
You think <i>they're</i> going home?

688
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:38,697
Yeah!
Hey, bro.

689
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:41,148
I'm whupping the shit out
this motherfucking game, dawg.

690
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:43,177
Ain't nobody fucking with me.

691
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:45,700
I'm about to get the
last cherry and shit.

692
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:48,284
Hey, I know he's been
talking to you, boy.

693
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:50,785
Shit.
I'm the greatest, cuz.

694
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:53,122
Got to level 180
on candy crush.

695
00:38:53,147 --> 00:38:55,136
- Beat that shit.
- I only see one of them.

696
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:57,463
Maybe the other one's
in the car.

697
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:02,552
Better call Saul, bitch.
Get the fuck over there.

698
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:06,371
Hey, bro, I told you
we was being followed.

699
00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:08,152
Look at this shit.

700
00:39:08,585 --> 00:39:09,976
Alright, bro.

701
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:12,864
What you want, a scooby snack
or some shit, man?

702
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:15,211
Bro, I'm just saying.
You always trying to act like

703
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:17,153
I'm not paying attention
and shit.

704
00:39:17,178 --> 00:39:19,956
Bah!
Call it correct.

705
00:39:20,082 --> 00:39:21,685
We saw you at the diner.

706
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,014
Saw you following us and shit.

707
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,798
You have fun?

708
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,666
What the fuck do you want, man?

709
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:32,493
I want to know who did the
drive-by on one of your corners.

710
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:35,990
Oh, you do, huh?

711
00:39:36,034 --> 00:39:37,301
Is that all?

712
00:39:37,326 --> 00:39:40,039
I mean, that's why you came
all the way down here for?

713
00:39:40,064 --> 00:39:41,943
Nah. nah.
You see?

714
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:44,452
There's something
you ain't telling me.

715
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,792
You know something about
who shot Donelle, bitch?

716
00:39:49,225 --> 00:39:51,413
Who's Donelle to you?!

717
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:54,601
Answer the motherfucking question.

718
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,358
You first.

719
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,383
Yo, yo.

720
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:09,259
What the fuck
is wrong with you, bro?

721
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:10,967
Sorry.

722
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:14,278
The Greek party was so sick,
son.

723
00:40:14,303 --> 00:40:17,144
I had to make another run.
Who we got here?

724
00:40:17,169 --> 00:40:19,041
We got a fucking procedure,
Bradley.

725
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:20,644
I told you don't be rolling up
all quick like that.

726
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,775
Alright, chill, man.
Why're you always sweating me, man?

727
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,225
All the business I bring you.

728
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,196
Dude, I bring you
all the campus green, son.

729
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:28,167
You keep plenty for yourself.

730
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,358
Oh, shit!

731
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:30,994
No, no, no, no!
Aww!

732
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,667
Give it to me
Let's go!

733
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:35,398
No! No!
Let's ask. Let's ask!

734
00:40:35,423 --> 00:40:36,888
Okay, you got it.
But hurry.

735
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:38,938
Tell us what we want to know,
and your brother gets a doctor.

736
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:40,670
Fuck you.
Get him one right now.

737
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:43,434
Donelle's corner.
The drive-by. That name.

738
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:45,185
Was it you or was it him?
Don't say, shit, man.

739
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,876
Better say something or you're
gonna hear his last breath.

740
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,566
It's a sound
you never stop hearing.

741
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:49,746
Fuck!
Alright!

742
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:51,544
It was Alonzo T.

743
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:54,507
He runs the south side
for Handro and them.

744
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:56,249
Teo.

745
00:40:59,577 --> 00:41:01,619
Fucking bitch.

746
00:41:11,598 --> 00:41:13,637
Come on. we got to go
if we're gonna make it.

747
00:41:13,662 --> 00:41:15,153
Let's go!

748
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:22,002
You know,
maybe you found the serenity

749
00:41:22,027 --> 00:41:24,272
to accept the things
you cannot change,

750
00:41:24,297 --> 00:41:28,359
and maybe you gained the courage
to change the things you can.

751
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:32,438
But finding the wisdom
to know the difference

752
00:41:32,463 --> 00:41:33,790
is the real challenge,

753
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:37,618
because the grief of your loss
can be so debilitating,

754
00:41:37,643 --> 00:41:40,576
it can cloud your judgment.

755
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,982
And that goes
for the Olsen twins.

756
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:54,256
Ashley here has no wallet,
no cash, no cellphone. And

757
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:55,575
unlike Mary-Kate here.

758
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,039
And what should we call
the one down here?

759
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:59,373
Humpty Dumpty?
Opie?

760
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:02,752
I'm gonna ask for overtime.

761
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,351
If they're gonna task us
and keep sending us out,

762
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:05,737
I mean, that's unfair.

763
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:07,380
They didn't send us.

764
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:10,458
I heard it was a revolver.
Something about it.

765
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:11,744
I called in and
asked for it.

766
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:13,321
I knew it.
I knew it.

767
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:15,602
What are you doing?
You volunteering us now?

768
00:42:15,627 --> 00:42:16,655
That's not procedure.

769
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,902
Since when have you stopped
following procedure?

770
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:22,178
Revolver again,
no cellphone again.

771
00:42:22,203 --> 00:42:24,221
- Kid have any drugs on him?
- Yeah.

772
00:42:24,246 --> 00:42:25,734
Enough to make it
the best fucking prom ever.

773
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:27,327
So what?

774
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:31,065
Ballistics comes back, it's gonna
be the same shooter as Donelle.

775
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,145
- We're gonna be ready.
- They won't give a shit upstairs.

776
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:35,023
Our task force is not
gonna get another task

777
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:36,702
for these motherfuckers.

778
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:38,337
A series of related shootings.

779
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:40,084
They're gonna give a shit.

780
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:42,321
Yeah.
Of course they will.

781
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:44,544
Somebody just killed Opie.

782
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:51,223
- Justin?
- Yeah?

783
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:55,051
- Justin?
- I'm in the bedroom.

784
00:43:01,437 --> 00:43:03,749
What do you...
What do you think you're doing?

785
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,583
- I cleared out his stuff.
- Where... Where is everything?

786
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:07,726
In the attic.

787
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,213
Who said you could do this?

788
00:43:09,238 --> 00:43:10,921
This is my room.
And I can't...

789
00:43:10,946 --> 00:43:13,820
No. no.
This is my house.

790
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:14,891
Alright?

791
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,154
So you bring it
all back now.

792
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:19,009
- Now!
- No!

793
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:20,801
I can't look at his stuff
every day!

794
00:43:20,826 --> 00:43:23,559
I'm sick of it!
He is not coming back, mom!

795
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:24,813
He's...

796
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:39,660
Lila, I'll send him home
if you want.

797
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:42,251
But he wants to stay
on my couch.

798
00:43:45,262 --> 00:43:48,080
Alright.
Um, tell him...

799
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,425
Tell him alright.

800
00:43:51,844 --> 00:43:53,975
Tell him I'm sorry.

801
00:44:00,873 --> 00:44:02,479
Here I am,
hurting over memories,

802
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:05,441
and he's having to look at it
every night.

803
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:09,019
Look... don't blame
yourself too much.

804
00:44:09,044 --> 00:44:12,200
It was like he was trying to put
his brother away for good.

805
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:13,620
No. unh-unh.
No.

806
00:44:13,645 --> 00:44:16,622
He kept Stephon's watch
as a reminder.

807
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:19,169
You ever keep anything?

808
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:23,266
Of course.

809
00:44:25,297 --> 00:44:27,785
I kept some clothes,

810
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:31,458
some pictures.

811
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:36,834
- And on my phone, I...
- I know what you're gonna say.

812
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:39,142
I know what you're gonna say
'cause I do the same thing.

813
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:41,682
I even paid the bill
so I could...

814
00:44:43,455 --> 00:44:46,616
<i>Yo, it's Stephon.
You know what to do.</i>

815
00:44:47,111 --> 00:44:48,591
Hear how he's trying
to be cool?

816
00:44:48,616 --> 00:44:51,357
Yo, it's Stephon.
You know what to do.

817
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:55,054
It sounds to me like he's
trying to tell us something.

818
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,420
We already have a name.

819
00:45:02,445 --> 00:45:04,378
Exactly.

820
00:45:07,632 --> 00:45:10,875
And I know to find him.

821
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:46,046
Look what they did!

822
00:45:55,913 --> 00:45:58,271
You don't think
I know who you are?

823
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:03,569
You think you can just show up
like no one would know?

824
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:08,148
We said no reporters.

825
00:46:08,177 --> 00:46:10,954
Oh.
I'm not a reporter.

826
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,837
Then who are you?

827
00:46:15,055 --> 00:46:18,174
I'm from a grief support group
for mothers.

828
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:19,941
And, um...

829
00:46:21,934 --> 00:46:26,345
I just wanted to leave
a card, just in case.

830
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:27,851
Oh.

831
00:46:30,368 --> 00:46:31,941
Thank you.

832
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,723
The family wanted to send
along a thank-you card,

833
00:46:39,748 --> 00:46:41,124
and he didn't leave an address.

834
00:46:41,149 --> 00:46:44,572
So we decided
to call the florist.

835
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,510
Alonzo, yes.

836
00:46:48,535 --> 00:46:50,841
Business address is fine.

837
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,654
Promiseland, Atlanta?

838
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,750
What's that?

839
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,863
Oh, a night club.

840
00:46:58,974 --> 00:47:00,584
Okay.

841
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:05,488
We're going to a night club.

842
00:47:05,513 --> 00:47:08,858
Ugh.
It's been so long.

843
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,027
I almost forgot
how to do this.

844
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:13,863
You're stepping out.
Might as well step out in style.

845
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:15,631
What do you think?

846
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,224
You look good!

847
00:47:19,342 --> 00:47:21,470
- Almost as good as me.
- Almost is good enough

848
00:47:21,495 --> 00:47:22,814
'cause I don't want to look
like no hoochie.

849
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,587
Oh! Really?
It's like that?

850
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:27,384
Your hair looks good.

851
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:29,701
- You like it? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

852
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:31,039
Chopped it myself.

853
00:47:31,064 --> 00:47:33,382
Used to be down to my ass,
but...

854
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:35,885
After my girl passed,
I just took a scissor to it.

855
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:37,053
Now I kind of like it.

856
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,876
Looks good.

857
00:47:39,507 --> 00:47:40,423
Alright.

858
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:41,557
- Let's take a picture.
- Okay.

859
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,092
Alright.
Ready?

860
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:44,594
Mm-hmm.

861
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,935
Oh!

862
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:55,262
That's a good one. Okay.
Do another one.

863
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:57,400
- Okay, okay. One more.
- Different pose.

864
00:47:59,157 --> 00:48:00,583
� Living in our prime �

865
00:48:00,608 --> 00:48:02,044

00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:27,231
� Living in my prime �

877
00:48:38,412 --> 00:48:41,203
How do we know
if Alonzo's even here?

878
00:48:41,228 --> 00:48:42,467
We don't!

879
00:48:42,492 --> 00:48:44,222
You got Teo's phone?

880
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:45,785
Um...

881
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,748
Alonzo isn't on here.

882
00:48:52,177 --> 00:48:54,343
But there's a Zo.

883
00:49:03,895 --> 00:49:05,202
Yo.

884
00:49:05,227 --> 00:49:07,817
Who's calling me on Teo's phone?

885
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:09,422
Hello?

886
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:11,714
That song.

887
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,016
You're in my club.

888
00:49:14,149 --> 00:49:16,115
The fuck?

889
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,321
� Hey, hey �

890
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:19,678
� No, no �

891
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:22,262
(Put your phone down)

892
00:49:58,462 --> 00:49:59,512
looks like They're leaving.

893
00:49:59,537 --> 00:50:01,917
No.
No, not tonight.

894
00:50:01,942 --> 00:50:03,529
Look at her.

895
00:50:03,554 --> 00:50:05,502
Lila, don't worry.

896
00:50:05,527 --> 00:50:07,636
I got this covered.

897
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:09,672
Trust me.

898
00:50:13,431 --> 00:50:16,343
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

899
00:50:16,395 --> 00:50:17,932
Excuse me.

900
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:20,062
Okay.

901
00:50:21,286 --> 00:50:23,323
Mm, god.
How far along are you?

902
00:50:23,348 --> 00:50:24,842
Oh, 6 months.

903
00:50:24,867 --> 00:50:26,422
6 months?

904
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:29,725
You know what I remember about
being 6 months pregnant?

905
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,423
I wanted it all the time.

906
00:50:32,973 --> 00:50:35,048
My hormones are jumping.

907
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,693
Oh, nope.
Don't bend.

908
00:50:36,718 --> 00:50:38,898
- Do not bend.
- We got you covered.

909
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:43,272
- There you go.
- Did you ever go out to dinner...

910
00:50:43,297 --> 00:50:45,309
I know what
you're gonna say.

911
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,481
Before I even opened the menu,

912
00:50:46,506 --> 00:50:48,545
I would be dragging him
back home.

913
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,756
Where do you think
I'm going now?

914
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:51,352
I know what
you're gonna say.

915
00:50:51,377 --> 00:50:53,315
And, you look great.

916
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,058
I know.

917
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:58,151
I know you got responsibilities,
but you can take a night off.

918
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:01,381
Where am I?
I'm at your place.

919
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:03,192
That is such a typical answer.

920
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:05,694
Ah, it's such
a typical question.

921
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,897
Have you thought about a name
for the baby yet?

922
00:51:08,922 --> 00:51:10,399
No.

923
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,235
'cause when the time come,
you gonna look up at me,

924
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,571
and I'm gonna just go
with whatever name you say.

925
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,105
Mm.

926
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:22,848
What about you?

927
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,514
Of course I have.

928
00:51:25,554 --> 00:51:28,418
Y'all be obsessing
over that shit.

929
00:51:28,779 --> 00:51:33,082
Ain't like... ain't like it
matter what I think no way.

930
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:40,711
I want to name
the baby, Worthington.

931
00:51:40,842 --> 00:51:42,245
You hear me?

932
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:44,731
Baby, come on, now.
Stop ignoring me.

933
00:51:44,756 --> 00:51:47,239
Baby, come on, now.
That was funny.

934
00:51:49,035 --> 00:51:50,344
Ba...

935
00:51:52,698 --> 00:51:54,356
Hey, what's this all about?

936
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:58,290
Just another drive-by,
just another two people dead.

937
00:51:58,471 --> 00:52:00,892
One named Ray.
And one named Stephon.

938
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,219
Stephon was my son,
and...

939
00:52:03,408 --> 00:52:04,566
I want the one responsible.

940
00:52:04,591 --> 00:52:06,361
It was you, Leo said.

941
00:52:06,386 --> 00:52:08,059
Leo?

942
00:52:08,735 --> 00:52:10,355
Teo and Donelle?
That was you?

943
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,850
I'm the one
asking the questions.

944
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:15,099
- I want to know.
- Fuck what you want to know, bitch.

945
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:17,700
You come up in here a...
Fuck you.

946
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:19,168
Did you kill my son?
Tell me.

947
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,233
- I ain't telling you shit.
- Kill him!

948
00:52:20,258 --> 00:52:21,433
Tell me what I want to know.

949
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:23,700
Maybe I got something
I can tell you.

950
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:25,731
Maybe I can make it over there
and snap your fucking neck

951
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:28,134
- before you pull the trigger.
- Maybe I'll ask Maya.

952
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:30,486
Remember Maya?
Yeah.

953
00:52:30,511 --> 00:52:33,608
Didn't even cross
your selfish-ass mind, huh?

954
00:52:34,537 --> 00:52:35,730
Where is she?

955
00:52:35,755 --> 00:52:37,689
She's in the closet.
She's fine.

956
00:52:37,714 --> 00:52:38,954
She's carrying my baby.

957
00:52:38,979 --> 00:52:41,932
You killed my baby. You think
I fucking care about yours?

958
00:52:41,957 --> 00:52:43,655
Oh, you not
getting out of here alive.

959
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,535
You think I care
about getting out alive?

960
00:52:47,594 --> 00:52:51,187
Alright.
You want to hear?

961
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:53,670
I'll tell you.

962
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,884
Ray was working
one of my corners

963
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:59,896
without doing what was right.

964
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:03,379
So, told Teo and Leo
to go tell him what was what,

965
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:05,281
but they ain't never
get around to it.

966
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:07,876
Then Donelle sends me word that

967
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:09,648
Ray's out there dissing me.

968
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,052
I was in the neighborhood.

969
00:53:11,077 --> 00:53:14,557
I decided
I'd take care of it myself.

970
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:17,041
I warned the motherfucker.

971
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:23,080
Everything's gonna be
all good. you know?

972
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:25,930
Tell her to chill.
Stephon's gonna be there.

973
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,626
But you start letting shit go,

974
00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:31,034
pretty soon it will all be gone.

975
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,586
I wasn't exactly looking
for your son,

976
00:53:36,611 --> 00:53:38,447
but he was there.

977
00:53:39,034 --> 00:53:40,881
He's right there.

978
00:53:43,705 --> 00:53:47,623
So you ask me who's responsible
for that shit on the corner...

979
00:53:49,132 --> 00:53:50,094
It's you.

980
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:51,610
- What are you...
- You motherf...

981
00:53:51,635 --> 00:53:53,462
You let him run the streets.

982
00:53:53,713 --> 00:53:55,198
He shouldn't have been there.

983
00:53:55,223 --> 00:53:57,183
- Shoot him.
- He- He got in the way.

984
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,776
That shit's gonna happen when you
somewhere you ain't supposed to be.

985
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:00,947
Finish him right now.

986
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:02,606
So, it's you.
It's me.

987
00:54:02,631 --> 00:54:04,646
It's- It's-
It's my man Handro in Mayfield.

988
00:54:04,671 --> 00:54:06,083
It's the world.

989
00:54:06,085 --> 00:54:07,347
- Same shit's gonna happen tomorrow.
- Kill him. Kill him.

990
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:09,149
World's gonna keep on turning.

991
00:54:09,174 --> 00:54:11,555
Do you think
you can stop it?

992
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,592
Heh-heh-heh...

993
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:15,735
Man, who are you?

994
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,895
I'm just a mother.

995
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,486
Ow!

996
00:54:25,282 --> 00:54:26,573
Are you okay?

997
00:54:26,598 --> 00:54:28,224
Come on!

998
00:54:37,246 --> 00:54:38,391
Let's go.
No!

999
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:40,181
Let's go.

1000
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:49,582
It's terrible.
That poor girl.

1001
00:54:49,607 --> 00:54:51,604
Poor girl?

1002
00:54:52,362 --> 00:54:54,567
She knew how he got his money.
And she knew what he did to get it,

1003
00:54:54,592 --> 00:54:55,915
and she fucked him anyway.

1004
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,309
- Fucked him because of it, probably.
- She didn't deserve to get shot.

1005
00:54:58,334 --> 00:55:00,145
<i>We</i> didn't shoot her!

1006
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:02,786
And that shit's gonna happen if
you're where you shouldn't be.

1007
00:55:02,811 --> 00:55:05,448
Isn't that what Zo said?
Fucking asshole.

1008
00:55:05,473 --> 00:55:07,506
You wanted justice,
you got it.

1009
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:09,408
I don't feel better.

1010
00:55:09,433 --> 00:55:11,702
That's because it's not over.

1011
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:15,578
Alonzo said his man in Mayfield
was the one who ordered that hit.

1012
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,688
I don't care about
the man in Mayfield.

1013
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:21,156
Well, you have to.
Because it's all connected.

1014
00:55:21,994 --> 00:55:24,484
- You don't see that?
- No.

1015
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:26,623
No, I don't see.

1016
00:55:28,096 --> 00:55:31,152
I'm sorry, eve,
but I'm done.

1017
00:55:31,563 --> 00:55:34,207
This wasn't just about you,
remember?

1018
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:37,628
We were supposed to be helping
each other here.

1019
00:55:39,556 --> 00:55:40,508
What?
So, what?

1020
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,583
Now we just go back to our lives
like nothing ever happened?

1021
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:46,531
After all we've been through
and all that we've done,

1022
00:55:46,556 --> 00:55:49,290
you really think
that we can go back?

1023
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:55,383
I went into the closet
to change.

1024
00:55:55,721 --> 00:55:57,720
Someone grabbed me from behind.

1025
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:59,388
And I heard a voice real low

1026
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:02,591
said I'd be dead
if I made one sound.

1027
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:04,460
Can you give us any description?

1028
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:06,871
I didn't see.
I didn't want to see.

1029
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,052
All I can say...

1030
00:56:09,213 --> 00:56:11,529
Is that she sounded real mad.

1031
00:56:11,554 --> 00:56:13,530
She?
Did you say she?

1032
00:56:15,263 --> 00:56:18,027
Only a few crews
got women running with them.

1033
00:56:18,029 --> 00:56:19,180
Someone's moving in.
I'm telling you.

1034
00:56:19,205 --> 00:56:20,977
All we got to do now
is start running names, records.

1035
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,877
What are you talking...
This isn't a turf war.

1036
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:25,006
"She sounded real mad."
That ain't turf. It's personal.

1037
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:26,323
You always say,
"Work the evidence."

1038
00:56:26,325 --> 00:56:27,907
So where you getting that?

1039
00:56:27,932 --> 00:56:29,941
Call it a working theory.

1040
00:56:38,498 --> 00:56:39,821
What's this all about?

1041
00:56:39,846 --> 00:56:42,091
We're having a little outing.

1042
00:56:44,164 --> 00:56:45,856
Mm-hmm.

1043
00:56:48,425 --> 00:56:50,698
Well, this is
a really good idea.

1044
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:52,988
Well, I am so glad
that you're enjoying it.

1045
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,123
Oh. yeah.

1046
00:56:54,148 --> 00:56:56,946
Ooh, and I know someone else
who would, too.

1047
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:58,766
Hmm.

1048
00:57:00,274 --> 00:57:02,017
Excuse me.

1049
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,797
- Alright, I know you're still mad at me...
- What about tomatoes?

1050
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:08,014
But some of us from the group
are out to dinner.

1051
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:09,597
And going to a movie, too.

1052
00:57:09,622 --> 00:57:11,410
Dinner and a movie.

1053
00:57:11,412 --> 00:57:13,653
I know it's not your thing,
but

1054
00:57:13,678 --> 00:57:15,269
I thought
I'd just let you know.

1055
00:57:15,271 --> 00:57:16,475
So, holla back.

1056
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,699
Mnh-mnh.

1057
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:20,717
Did she,
"Holla back"?

1058
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:23,402
Well, I know
you all still say that.

1059
00:57:23,404 --> 00:57:26,210
No. no.

1060
00:57:26,512 --> 00:57:28,166
Lila, was that your friend Eve?

1061
00:57:28,191 --> 00:57:29,387
Mm-hmm.

1062
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,926
Any luck with getting her
to come back?

1063
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:32,728
I tried,
but you know how she is.

1064
00:57:32,753 --> 00:57:34,110
I-I've heard you mention her,

1065
00:57:34,135 --> 00:57:36,147
but I must have missed
meeting her.

1066
00:57:36,172 --> 00:57:37,853
Is she that new woman
from Decatur?

1067
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:40,153
No.
She lives in Midtown.

1068
00:57:41,735 --> 00:57:44,544
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

1069
00:57:44,786 --> 00:57:46,595
I know we're here to celebrate

1070
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:49,483
getting this lovely lady
out of the house.

1071
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:53,591
But I also want to make a toast
to her son, Mr. Justin,

1072
00:57:53,616 --> 00:57:55,737
the award-winning artiste.

1073
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:56,795
Mm!

1074
00:57:56,797 --> 00:57:57,974
Award?
Cheers.

1075
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:59,711
Wait a minute.
Award-winning?

1076
00:57:59,736 --> 00:58:01,062
What award?

1077
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,526
Um, nothing.
It's just a school thing.

1078
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:05,340
My art project won a contest.

1079
00:58:05,365 --> 00:58:07,110
Why didn't you tell her?

1080
00:58:07,135 --> 00:58:09,807
I couldn't. I mean,
I couldn't find the time to.

1081
00:58:09,832 --> 00:58:11,268
What do you mean,
you couldn't find the time to?

1082
00:58:11,293 --> 00:58:13,320
You could just say it.
How hard is that?

1083
00:58:13,345 --> 00:58:16,204
Real hard lately.
I never see you.

1084
00:58:16,229 --> 00:58:18,805
You're either working
on the house or with them.

1085
00:58:20,807 --> 00:58:23,114
So, when you get home...

1086
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:25,422
I'd like to see it, please.

1087
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:27,669
Show your mama.

1088
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,700
I wasn't sure how you'd feel.

1089
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,460
Do you like it?

1090
00:58:45,425 --> 00:58:47,507
I love it.

1091
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,900
I love you.

1092
00:58:57,528 --> 00:59:00,898
- I love you too, Mom.
- I love you so much.

1093
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,945
Hmm.

1094
00:59:12,899 --> 00:59:14,578
Hey.

1095
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,994
The mailman left me
some of yours.

1096
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:20,175
I had nothing to do...

1097
00:59:32,131 --> 00:59:34,883
Got the forensics.
No prints.

1098
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:38,006
Zo's phone was gone.
I got the records.

1099
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:40,473
Guess who his last caller
was from?

1100
00:59:40,498 --> 00:59:41,810
Teo Corlone.

1101
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,790
Teo's got a pretty good alibi,
what with being dead and all.

1102
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:47,747
So, the shooter has Zo's phone,
Teo, and Donelle...

1103
00:59:47,772 --> 00:59:49,221
What are you doing?
Don't touch my shit.

1104
00:59:49,246 --> 00:59:51,578
Yeah, you better put on
your jacket.

1105
00:59:53,398 --> 00:59:55,545
Oh, you finally
got a case big enough

1106
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,190
to get you face time
upstairs, huh?

1107
00:59:57,215 --> 00:59:59,370
Pretty-boy college kid getting
killed got his attention.

1108
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,466
So.

1109
01:00:00,491 --> 01:00:02,656
What's the latest with
the Bradley Tipton case?

1110
01:00:02,681 --> 01:00:05,386
Well, we do know it's the same
gun for all the shootings.

1111
01:00:05,411 --> 01:00:07,256
Phone records link them all.

1112
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:09,787
Alonzo to Leo,
Alonzo to Teo,

1113
01:00:09,812 --> 01:00:13,594
- Leo and Teo to Donelle, Donelle...
- All the varied permutations.

1114
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:16,010
He's been waiting to use
that $10 word.

1115
01:00:16,225 --> 01:00:17,424
Like I was saying,

1116
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:19,752
they all worked together,
now they're all dead.

1117
01:00:19,777 --> 01:00:21,875
The Alejandro organization
supplies the neighborhood,

1118
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,934
but, uh, but these guys,
they're local.

1119
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,317
It all points to a turf war.

1120
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:27,400
What?
No.

1121
01:00:27,425 --> 01:00:29,854
The physical evidence doesn't,
the crime scenes sure don't.

1122
01:00:29,879 --> 01:00:31,026
I don't know
what else it could be.

1123
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:32,502
And I got the D.A. calling me.

1124
01:00:32,527 --> 01:00:33,569
I got the press up my ass.

1125
01:00:33,571 --> 01:00:35,608
What would you have me
tell them, Holliston?

1126
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,733
Well, you can tell them no comment.
It's still under investigation.

1127
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:41,079
That your heart
goes out to the families.

1128
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,699
Turf war's our working theory.

1129
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,073
Help me out, Scaketti.

1130
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:47,247
I got it narrowed down
to two crews...

1131
01:00:47,272 --> 01:00:49,179
Quincy Corners and 16th street.

1132
01:00:49,204 --> 01:00:51,448
They're the ones who've had
women running with them.

1133
01:00:51,473 --> 01:00:53,256
Okay.

1134
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:55,859
That's good.
Keep me informed.

1135
01:00:57,537 --> 01:01:00,861
Inform me on how your
theories fit the details.

1136
01:01:00,886 --> 01:01:02,623
Say, with the wild shooting.

1137
01:01:02,648 --> 01:01:04,594
And with taking the phone
and leaving the drugs

1138
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,827
- and leaving a fucking witness.
- You got a better fucking theory?

1139
01:01:06,852 --> 01:01:07,706
Yeah.

1140
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:10,093
Somebody's trying to climb up the
ladder, but not for reasons you think.

1141
01:01:10,118 --> 01:01:12,160
Let's try climbing back down.

1142
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,105
- It's Alonzo's neighborhood, right?
- Uh-huh.

1143
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,488
He gives a franchise
to Leo and Teo.

1144
01:01:18,513 --> 01:01:21,258
Bradley, not-so-innocent
bystander.

1145
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,537
Leo and Teo bring on Donelle,
who replaces Ray.

1146
01:01:24,562 --> 01:01:27,832
And Stephon, wrong place
at the wrong time.

1147
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,531
And it's a woman.

1148
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,017
So, what woman?

1149
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:36,707
Jesus Christ.

1150
01:01:36,732 --> 01:01:37,759
Oh, shit.

1151
01:01:37,784 --> 01:01:39,220
Holliston.

1152
01:01:39,245 --> 01:01:42,297
Yo.  You heard what
the chief said just now.

1153
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:44,805
Turf war's our working theory.

1154
01:01:44,908 --> 01:01:46,735
Go home, man.

1155
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:52,974
So, don't forget that we have
that fundraiser for tomorrow.

1156
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,222
And if I can get
a couple volunteers

1157
01:01:55,222 --> 01:01:55,243
to maybe make some lemon squares
or some muffins...
And if I can get
a couple volunteers

1158
01:01:55,243 --> 01:01:59,858
to maybe make some lemon squares
or some muffins...

1159
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,149
Muffins.

1160
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:02,450
Thank you.
It'd be great.

1161
01:02:02,475 --> 01:02:04,659
Thank you, guys.
Hi, Lila.

1162
01:02:04,684 --> 01:02:08,190
Oh, and...
I think I see a new face.

1163
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:09,758
- Was it Nita?
- Mm-hmm.

1164
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,226
- Welcome.
- Welcome, Nita.

1165
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:14,917
You're welcome to share
if you'd like.

1166
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:28,564
I lost my two sons,
Leo and Teo.

1167
01:02:29,716 --> 01:02:33,039
They would tease each other,
but you could see the love.

1168
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,818
They would come and see me
every Sunday.

1169
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,357
That's nice.

1170
01:02:38,382 --> 01:02:41,125
I'm just a cashier,
but they bought me a house.

1171
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:43,395
But they... they loved
working with their hands.

1172
01:02:43,397 --> 01:02:45,376
They... they were
in construction.

1173
01:02:45,401 --> 01:02:47,951
They were dealers,
the news said.

1174
01:02:50,051 --> 01:02:52,407
We're here to support
each other.

1175
01:02:52,432 --> 01:02:55,991
Oh, we've suffered
too much to... to lie.

1176
01:02:56,016 --> 01:02:58,126
You don't think I've suffered?

1177
01:02:58,304 --> 01:02:59,769
Yeah.

1178
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,838
Yeah, you've suffered.
I...

1179
01:03:01,863 --> 01:03:04,549
You deserve our love and comfort.
I...

1180
01:03:04,574 --> 01:03:07,048
If you need any help,
I'll be glad to...

1181
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:10,879
I know we...
We have rules and all.

1182
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:13,589
And I want to do
the right thing,

1183
01:03:13,614 --> 01:03:17,473
but if you knew
what your boys were into,

1184
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:20,195
if you took one dime
from them, knowing,

1185
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:22,998
and you didn't do everything
you could to stop them...

1186
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,059
Patrice.

1187
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,344
She may deserve
comfort and support.

1188
01:03:28,707 --> 01:03:30,311
She doesn't deserve it from us.

1189
01:03:30,336 --> 01:03:31,797
I'm sorry,
but I agree with Patrice.

1190
01:03:31,822 --> 01:03:33,130
No.

1191
01:03:35,573 --> 01:03:37,367
She's a mother, too.

1192
01:03:37,392 --> 01:03:39,915
She's in pain just like us.

1193
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:42,248
I'm not sure we should judge.

1194
01:03:43,726 --> 01:03:45,558
We shouldn't.

1195
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:59,878
Ms. Walcott,
you got a few minutes?

1196
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:01,803
Talk about the case?

1197
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,291
There's a place nearby.
J.J.'s.

1198
01:04:04,316 --> 01:04:07,140
Sure.
I'll meet you there.

1199
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:24,517
Miguel Alejandro's crew
runs the whole south side.

1200
01:04:24,648 --> 01:04:26,439
In your area,

1201
01:04:26,464 --> 01:04:29,601
he had a guy named
Alonzo Troys running things.

1202
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:32,348
Alonzo leads to Leo and Teo.

1203
01:04:32,373 --> 01:04:33,652
They lead to Donelle.

1204
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:36,571
They all worked together,
and they're all dead.

1205
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:38,121
Bradley, the white frat boy,

1206
01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:39,606
he's just big
into dealing on campus.

1207
01:04:39,631 --> 01:04:42,100
We think it was a wrong place,
wrong time situation.

1208
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,546
That's been known to happen.

1209
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:50,172
Anyway,
Donelle takes over for Ray.

1210
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:54,700
So it all leads back to the corner
where Stephon was killed.

1211
01:04:56,989 --> 01:04:59,456
Now, there's something
I got to ask.

1212
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,025
Did Stephon know these guys?

1213
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:06,384
Who the hell you think you are,
asking me that?

1214
01:05:06,409 --> 01:05:08,904
Bringing me here to ask me that?

1215
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:11,022
That white cheerleader
you got posted up on your board

1216
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:13,189
and Bradley...
You ask their mothers that?

1217
01:05:13,214 --> 01:05:15,310
Or just ones like me?

1218
01:05:16,054 --> 01:05:18,313
He never knew them, never met them,
never had one thing to do with them

1219
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:20,801
till the day they murdered him.

1220
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:22,298
I'm just trying
to make sense of it.

1221
01:05:22,323 --> 01:05:24,246
You have no idea what
it's like to lose a child.

1222
01:05:24,271 --> 01:05:26,091
No idea.

1223
01:05:26,116 --> 01:05:27,995
I'm afraid I do.

1224
01:05:33,341 --> 01:05:35,441
I'm sorry about that.

1225
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:39,885
Well, if you have
nothing else to tell me,

1226
01:05:39,914 --> 01:05:42,054
I'm gonna go home.

1227
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:45,082
But, you know,
there is one other thing.

1228
01:05:45,545 --> 01:05:51,127
Um...
Alonzo's girl, Maya,

1229
01:05:51,959 --> 01:05:56,079
she, uh, identified
the shooter as a woman.

1230
01:05:56,858 --> 01:05:59,144
Said she sounded real mad.

1231
01:05:59,853 --> 01:06:02,223
No one's gonna believe that.

1232
01:06:04,899 --> 01:06:08,680
So, what's gonna happen
to the case now?

1233
01:06:08,705 --> 01:06:11,542
If it stops now,
nothing, probably.

1234
01:06:13,529 --> 01:06:15,356
If it happens again,

1235
01:06:15,381 --> 01:06:17,937
I'm gonna find
the one responsible.

1236
01:06:18,598 --> 01:06:20,446
I'm gonna have to.

1237
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,659
Leave more than that.

1238
01:06:23,454 --> 01:06:25,146
What?
It's 15%.

1239
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,251
We took up a booth.

1240
01:06:26,276 --> 01:06:28,801
You ever think about
what women go through?

1241
01:06:28,865 --> 01:06:30,369
Yeah.

1242
01:06:30,394 --> 01:06:32,383
Quite a bit lately.

1243
01:06:55,496 --> 01:06:56,564
- You're under arrest.
- Oh.

1244
01:06:56,589 --> 01:06:59,488
Oh, that's not funny.
Put it away!

1245
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,680
It's kind of funny.

1246
01:07:01,705 --> 01:07:04,721
I wanted to see how you'd feel
if I didn't show.

1247
01:07:05,066 --> 01:07:06,161
You were so scared.

1248
01:07:06,186 --> 01:07:08,323
Hell, yeah, I was scared.
That detective knows.

1249
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:10,109
That man don't know shit.

1250
01:07:10,134 --> 01:07:11,259
What you need
to be worried about

1251
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:13,194
is our man in Mayfield,
Alonzo's boss.

1252
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,130
It's time for me and Justin
to move away.

1253
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:17,859
Oh, Jesus.
You with the running.

1254
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:19,102
I need to think about Justin,

1255
01:07:19,127 --> 01:07:21,116
and the girls in the support
group will understand if...

1256
01:07:21,141 --> 01:07:24,281
The girls in the group
don't give a fuck about you.

1257
01:07:25,258 --> 01:07:27,025
I do.

1258
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,560
You want to run away?

1259
01:07:30,585 --> 01:07:32,246
Fine.

1260
01:07:32,758 --> 01:07:35,540
But we got to finish
what we started

1261
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:37,963
or they're gonna finish us.

1262
01:07:49,245 --> 01:07:52,263
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

1263
01:07:52,842 --> 01:07:55,348
You know, I think that once
we finish the renovation,

1264
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:58,316
that, uh,
we're gonna move.

1265
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:00,752
- Really?
- Yeah.

1266
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:02,835
I think it's something
we've got to do.

1267
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,682
I understand.

1268
01:08:08,813 --> 01:08:10,608
What about Ben?

1269
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,288
That's a good question.

1270
01:08:13,313 --> 01:08:14,908
I like him.

1271
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:17,006
I like him, too.

1272
01:08:18,248 --> 01:08:20,249
Stay down!

1273
01:08:24,904 --> 01:08:27,172
Aah!

1274
01:08:40,721 --> 01:08:42,276
Justin?

1275
01:08:44,584 --> 01:08:46,816
Somebody call an ambulance!

1276
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:54,573
Are you alright?

1277
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,617
Oh, Justin.
Justin. oh.

1278
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:17,752
Oh, Justin.

1279
01:09:18,047 --> 01:09:19,640
Justin.

1280
01:09:20,012 --> 01:09:22,210
- Oh, here, ma'am. Back here.
- Justin.

1281
01:09:22,235 --> 01:09:23,688
Justin.

1282
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,624
Hey, Mom.

1283
01:09:30,419 --> 01:09:32,665
Ms. Walcott?
About your son.

1284
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:35,076
He's got a broken kneecap,
but he's gonna be just fine.

1285
01:09:35,101 --> 01:09:36,485
Okay.
Okay.

1286
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,506
- What's up, big man?
- Hey.

1287
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,629
What'd I tell you about driving?

1288
01:09:39,654 --> 01:09:42,129
Oh.
Thanks for coming.

1289
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:45,703
Come on, now.
No need for that.

1290
01:09:45,984 --> 01:09:47,546
Let me get you
and Justin home.

1291
01:09:47,571 --> 01:09:51,520
You both can stay with me until
you can get things straight.

1292
01:09:52,196 --> 01:09:54,959
Justin,
you good?

1293
01:09:54,989 --> 01:09:56,884
- Yeah.
- Alright.

1294
01:09:56,909 --> 01:09:59,741
We gonna get you out of here,
get you home.

1295
01:10:00,872 --> 01:10:03,264
One child dead,
and...

1296
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:04,766
And then he threatens
the other child.

1297
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:06,562
I mean,
everyone's children, really.

1298
01:10:06,587 --> 01:10:08,286
Really.

1299
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:14,281
I am not going back
to feeling helpless.

1300
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,587
You know how you told me
you always like to

1301
01:10:20,612 --> 01:10:23,918
clean house,
whenever something bad happens?

1302
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,128
Your way of making it better,
right?

1303
01:10:26,153 --> 01:10:27,422
Yeah.
Being in control.

1304
01:10:27,447 --> 01:10:29,138
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

1305
01:10:29,163 --> 01:10:31,612
Well, let's finish the house...

1306
01:10:32,384 --> 01:10:35,367
In a way that will finish off
Alejandro.

1307
01:10:35,551 --> 01:10:37,965
Okay.
Where do we begin?

1308
01:11:28,378 --> 01:11:31,168
<i>Hey, it's me.
The trap is set.</i>

1309
01:11:31,193 --> 01:11:34,657
<i>Cheese is in place.
All we need is the rat.</i>

1310
01:11:34,682 --> 01:11:36,819
<i>Pick me up tonight.</i>

1311
01:11:52,466 --> 01:11:54,457
You got Patrice's ride, huh?

1312
01:11:54,482 --> 01:11:56,176
Mm-hmm.

1313
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,317
I got the address, maps,
everything.

1314
01:12:02,897 --> 01:12:04,830
Where'd you get this?

1315
01:12:04,855 --> 01:12:06,551
You know where I got it.

1316
01:12:06,576 --> 01:12:08,046
You were in my office?

1317
01:12:08,071 --> 01:12:11,093
Duh. it's the office
of public records.

1318
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:12,527
Did someone help you?

1319
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,079
No, I did it myself.
It was easy.

1320
01:12:14,118 --> 01:12:16,924
I mean, the computer did
most of the work, but...

1321
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,637
Come on.
We got to go.

1322
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:25,357
2121 Dogwood.

1323
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:34,816
I want you to look down
at Alejandro's house

1324
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:37,117
and tell me what you see.

1325
01:12:37,677 --> 01:12:39,464
A party.

1326
01:12:39,573 --> 01:12:42,445
Alejandro's out there,
and we're over here,

1327
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:45,408
and he doesn't even think
about what he does to us.

1328
01:12:46,687 --> 01:12:48,456
And that's what I mean.

1329
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:50,408
It's not you.

1330
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:53,204
It's the world
that's lost its mind.

1331
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:17,719
Stay down.

1332
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:20,499
Who the fuck calls me
on his own cell.

1333
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:25,207
- Who is this?
- Your friends already told you.

1334
01:13:25,232 --> 01:13:29,054
I met a few of them the other day
when I was taking my son to school.

1335
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:32,755
What did you expect?
You fuck with my people.

1336
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:37,140
And now you come here,
and you fuck with my family.

1337
01:13:37,165 --> 01:13:39,894
I'm gonna fucking
kill you myself

1338
01:13:39,919 --> 01:13:42,246
and your family.

1339
01:13:49,005 --> 01:13:50,969
You watch.

1340
01:13:51,325 --> 01:13:53,713
He's gonna go down tomorrow.

1341
01:13:53,836 --> 01:13:56,591
Wait. What're you going to doing
with the gun and the phone?

1342
01:13:56,616 --> 01:13:58,764
I'll take care of everything.

1343
01:14:16,717 --> 01:14:18,412
Mmm.

1344
01:14:19,424 --> 01:14:21,815
How're you, Mr. Homemaker?

1345
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,815
I'm good now that you're back.

1346
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:26,692
Patrice called.

1347
01:14:26,717 --> 01:14:29,966
The girl wanna come
to see you and Justin.

1348
01:14:30,096 --> 01:14:31,318
Maybe in a few days.

1349
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:33,672
Just so we can get our
act together. You know.

1350
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:35,489
Okay.

1351
01:14:35,926 --> 01:14:39,369
So.  Are we gonna
meet Ms. Eve this time?

1352
01:14:39,397 --> 01:14:41,799
We've met everyone
but your sponsor.

1353
01:14:41,824 --> 01:14:44,019
- What's up with that?
- Oh, what's up with that?

1354
01:14:44,044 --> 01:14:45,951
You know what.
Let me introduce you to her.

1355
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:48,483
'Cause everyone wants
to meet Ms. Eve.

1356
01:14:48,516 --> 01:14:50,995
Everyone wants to meet Ms. Eve.

1357
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,738
- Here she goes.
- Alright.

1358
01:14:56,115 --> 01:15:00,539
Woo, girl.
You're looking good.

1359
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:03,839
That's weird.

1360
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:09,169
No worries. I'll just meet her when she
comes and visit with the other girls.

1361
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,408
Are you coming to bed?

1362
01:15:18,784 --> 01:15:20,584
Almost as good as me.

1363
01:15:20,609 --> 01:15:21,708
Almost is good enough

1364
01:15:21,733 --> 01:15:23,186
'cause I don't want to look
like no hoochie.

1365
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,358
Oh! Really?
It's like that?

1366
01:15:25,769 --> 01:15:26,878
No tension.

1367
01:15:26,903 --> 01:15:28,764
- I like that one.
- Okay.

1368
01:15:29,179 --> 01:15:30,769
Hoochie?

1369
01:15:40,934 --> 01:15:43,208
We've met everyone but your sponsor.

1370
01:15:43,233 --> 01:15:46,375
- What's up with that?
- Lila, was that your friend Eve?

1371
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,104
I-I've heard you mention her,

1372
01:15:48,129 --> 01:15:50,134
but I must have missed
meeting her.

1373
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,924
Is she that new woman
from Decatur?

1374
01:15:51,949 --> 01:15:53,426
No.
She lives in Midtown.

1375
01:15:53,451 --> 01:15:55,990
When that child is murdered,

1376
01:15:56,015 --> 01:15:58,520
we feel guilt, depression,

1377
01:15:58,545 --> 01:16:01,403
We lose our homes, our minds...

1378
01:16:01,428 --> 01:16:02,656
Charles is coming home.

1379
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:04,250
This has happened to her before?

1380
01:16:04,275 --> 01:16:07,130
We all have our hard times.

1381
01:16:07,155 --> 01:16:10,257
If I lost it,
would I even know it?

1382
01:16:11,138 --> 01:16:13,662
Answer the motherfucking question.

1383
01:16:13,687 --> 01:16:15,623
You first.

1384
01:16:15,648 --> 01:16:17,428
She's not real then.

1385
01:16:17,453 --> 01:16:19,323
I'll take care of everything.

1386
01:16:19,348 --> 01:16:23,436
Her leather bag would be with me.
Would be with me, wowen.

1387
01:16:45,312 --> 01:16:47,299
This got to stop.

1388
01:16:48,272 --> 01:16:49,876
No more.

1389
01:16:52,813 --> 01:16:53,775
No more.

1390
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,413
No more what?

1391
01:16:57,253 --> 01:16:59,734
You asked for help
and you got it.

1392
01:16:59,759 --> 01:17:01,740
- Not any more.
- What do you want?

1393
01:17:01,765 --> 01:17:03,848
More advice.

1394
01:17:04,163 --> 01:17:05,609
Here's some advice.

1395
01:17:05,634 --> 01:17:08,771
You send some assholes
to the grave early.

1396
01:17:08,796 --> 01:17:10,957
- Don't sweat it.
- Shut up!

1397
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,256
What.
You gonna cry?

1398
01:17:14,513 --> 01:17:16,263
Over them?

1399
01:17:16,288 --> 01:17:18,003
They made their choice.

1400
01:17:18,028 --> 01:17:20,086
And they knew their day
was gonna come.

1401
01:17:20,111 --> 01:17:22,415
And when it comes,
are they sorry?

1402
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,046

No!

1403
01:17:24,226 --> 01:17:26,292
They still reaching for a gun
trying to aim it at us.

1404
01:17:26,317 --> 01:17:28,468
Stephon is dead.

1405
01:17:29,492 --> 01:17:31,221
He's dead.

1406
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:34,598
Killing is not going to
bring him back. And...

1407
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:39,028
And what we did...

1408
01:17:41,482 --> 01:17:43,722
It was wrong.

1409
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:53,823
You think it's over
for Alejandro.

1410
01:17:55,419 --> 01:17:57,283
He's coming.

1411
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:00,938
He's coming.

1412
01:18:00,963 --> 01:18:02,393
I mean.

1413
01:18:02,452 --> 01:18:05,759
- And he's not gonna stop coming.
- He's not gonna stop coming.

1414
01:18:05,907 --> 01:18:10,017
- Until he find you appends.
- ... suspends.

1415
01:18:10,171 --> 01:18:14,212
- And he said he's gonna kill Justin.
- ... Justin.

1416
01:18:14,877 --> 01:18:17,551
- I have to...
- finish the job.

1417
01:18:17,576 --> 01:18:20,039
Finish the job when...

1418
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:23,211
Move on.

1419
01:18:23,236 --> 01:18:25,384
Yes, so we can move on.

1420
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,551
- Together.
- Together.

1421
01:18:28,713 --> 01:18:30,124
No.

1422
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:36,662
I'm done after this.
I'm done after this.

1423
01:18:39,075 --> 01:18:41,079
It's not up to you.

1424
01:18:44,543 --> 01:18:47,217
The gun in Justin's bag.

1425
01:18:53,079 --> 01:18:54,915
Atta girl.

1426
01:18:55,182 --> 01:18:57,688
Who do you think
did all that?

1427
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,443
Go say your good byes.

1428
01:20:00,302 --> 01:20:06,367
I'll be back tonight. If you're here
before me, heat this up  -  Lila.

1429
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,037
You hungry?

1430
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:20,315
Nobody's home.

1431
01:20:44,981 --> 01:20:48,426
I talked to Patrice about
another dinner and movie night.

1432
01:20:49,676 --> 01:20:51,419
I have Patrice's car.

1433
01:20:51,444 --> 01:20:53,791
So, would I drive it and
pick up the rest of them?

1434
01:20:53,816 --> 01:20:55,048
Yeah.

1435
01:20:55,073 --> 01:20:58,706
Like I said. Anything you need...
Let me know.

1436
01:20:58,731 --> 01:21:00,276
Ben.

1437
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,333
Could you look after Justin for me
if you don't mind.

1438
01:21:05,358 --> 01:21:06,988
While I just...

1439
01:21:07,013 --> 01:21:09,234
go over to the house
finish some stuff.

1440
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:10,801
Sure.

1441
01:21:13,253 --> 01:21:15,408
Yeah, I can.

1442
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:32,657
Damn.

1443
01:21:32,682 --> 01:21:35,050
That bitch is right
across the street.

1444
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,022
Here she comes.

1445
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,353
If you don't do it,
I will.

1446
01:22:09,086 --> 01:22:13,064
I'm sorry sorry sorry...

1447
01:22:16,073 --> 01:22:17,464
He can't stop it.

1448
01:22:17,489 --> 01:22:19,276
- Yo, what the fuck is that?
- What the hell !

1449
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:20,676
Get out man!
Get the fuck out of here!

1450
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:21,956
Can't stop it now.

1451
01:22:21,981 --> 01:22:23,932
But I can stop you.

1452
01:22:23,957 --> 01:22:25,280
Put that shit out, man!

1453
01:22:25,305 --> 01:22:26,722
Get out!

1454
01:22:28,015 --> 01:22:29,636
AWW!

1455
01:22:47,975 --> 01:22:49,501
Lila.

1456
01:22:52,454 --> 01:22:56,748
I got you.
I got you.

1457
01:22:59,229 --> 01:23:02,571
It's gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

1458
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,460
Adhesive on a trim?
All flammable.

1459
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:10,029
Not exactly safe.
Especially when a gas go.

1460
01:23:10,054 --> 01:23:11,667
And right after
Alejandro's house get shot,

1461
01:23:11,692 --> 01:23:13,132
he just happens to
be at her house?

1462
01:23:13,157 --> 01:23:15,331
Come on.
Give me a fucking break.

1463
01:23:16,936 --> 01:23:18,733
Somebody's mother.

1464
01:23:18,993 --> 01:23:20,916
And you gotta
pull in a Dirty Harry.

1465
01:23:20,941 --> 01:23:23,803
Exploding stove.
Rigged house.

1466
01:23:23,828 --> 01:23:27,336
She gets out of the hospital tomorrow,
we bring her in, lean on her.

1467
01:23:27,361 --> 01:23:29,601
Then we take it upstairs.

1468
01:23:30,124 --> 01:23:32,460
You're my partner for a long time.

1469
01:23:33,463 --> 01:23:36,380
But you bring this upstairs,
you bring it alone.

1470
01:23:40,455 --> 01:23:42,381
It's good work, old man.

1471
01:23:42,644 --> 01:23:44,571
It's a real good one.

1472
01:23:49,807 --> 01:23:54,766
So. Before we eat this wonderful
cake that Patrice made,

1473
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:58,618
look at all these
donations for Lila.

1474
01:23:59,664 --> 01:24:01,028
Woo.

1475
01:24:01,053 --> 01:24:03,507
You all shouldn't
have done all that.

1476
01:24:03,615 --> 01:24:05,780
We thought you could
use a little cheering up.

1477
01:24:05,805 --> 01:24:07,791
Along with clothes and...

1478
01:24:07,816 --> 01:24:09,754
Well, everything you might need.

1479
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:11,370
Thank you.

1480
01:24:11,395 --> 01:24:14,167
I think I see a new face.

1481
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,550
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1482
01:24:22,279 --> 01:24:25,777
So. Why don't we
take our break.

1483
01:24:25,844 --> 01:24:27,228
Okay

1484
01:24:31,789 --> 01:24:34,045
I saw some of these things.

1485
01:24:34,292 --> 01:24:36,803
It was in your son's
room that time.

1486
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:38,474
Yeah.

1487
01:24:38,951 --> 01:24:42,717
Justin won an art contest so
the women want to see it.

1488
01:24:42,742 --> 01:24:44,855
So, I brought it here
today for the party.

1489
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,953
Lucky it didn't get lost
in the fire.

1490
01:24:46,978 --> 01:24:48,898
No.
I got it...

1491
01:24:51,617 --> 01:24:53,851
I'm gonna need you
to come in.

1492
01:24:54,909 --> 01:24:57,421
I already answered all the questions.
So.

1493
01:24:57,446 --> 01:25:00,018
We need you to
clear up a few things.

1494
01:25:01,868 --> 01:25:04,004
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

1495
01:25:04,029 --> 01:25:06,282
That fire.
Those shootings.

1496
01:25:06,307 --> 01:25:08,876
People got killed,
and...

1497
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,298
I'm sorry,
it's what it comes down to.

1498
01:25:13,323 --> 01:25:15,202
Nothing else.

1499
01:25:15,417 --> 01:25:16,736
You sure?

1500
01:25:16,761 --> 01:25:19,203
That's what it has
to come down to.

1501
01:25:19,332 --> 01:25:22,164
Who're you trying to convince?

1502
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:27,838
If you don't come with me now,
it's gonna be Ben coming with me.

1503
01:25:28,033 --> 01:25:29,982
And then Justin.

1504
01:25:30,394 --> 01:25:31,471
It's up to you.

1505
01:25:31,496 --> 01:25:34,445
Now. You know they have
nothing to do with this.

1506
01:25:39,757 --> 01:25:41,258
I'll go.

1507
01:25:42,579 --> 01:25:45,194
I'm willing to take
whatever happens.

1508
01:25:49,555 --> 01:25:50,910
What's this about?

1509
01:25:50,935 --> 01:25:52,715
It's okay, Mae.
I have to go with him.

1510
01:25:52,739 --> 01:25:53,904
If it's about the fire
and

1511
01:25:53,929 --> 01:25:55,799
all those shootings
that've been all over the news.

1512
01:25:55,824 --> 01:25:57,341
If that's what you want
to talk to her about

1513
01:25:57,366 --> 01:25:58,656
then there's something
you need to know.

1514
01:25:58,681 --> 01:26:00,302
Patrice. Patrice.
Let me go with him, okay.

1515
01:26:00,334 --> 01:26:01,910
Lila lives near me.

1516
01:26:01,935 --> 01:26:04,462
And she was having
a real hard time.

1517
01:26:04,487 --> 01:26:07,234
I think you don't
understand that or care but.

1518
01:26:07,259 --> 01:26:09,223
I look in on her
from time to time.

1519
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:10,533
Some of the nights
you're talking about,

1520
01:26:10,558 --> 01:26:11,711
I know I was with here.

1521
01:26:11,736 --> 01:26:14,397
- I've spent time with her too.
- So did I. We all did.

1522
01:26:14,422 --> 01:26:16,067
- Sidney in tears, we all were there.
- No!

1523
01:26:16,092 --> 01:26:18,333
- Dinner. We went to dinner last week.
- No!

1524
01:26:18,358 --> 01:26:19,484
You gave Cindy the lime.

1525
01:26:19,509 --> 01:26:20,902
I don't want
you all doing this.

1526
01:26:20,927 --> 01:26:22,084
Lila.
Stop.

1527
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:24,892
I'm not gonna let
you guys do this.

1528
01:26:25,033 --> 01:26:28,143
Lila.
We have to do this.

1529
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:45,676
A room full of grieving mothers.

1530
01:26:47,975 --> 01:26:50,021
Hell of an alibi.

1531
01:27:09,001 --> 01:27:10,370
I'll miss you.

1532
01:27:10,395 --> 01:27:12,323
Come on,
let's get in there.

1533
01:27:12,348 --> 01:27:14,682
- Take care of that leg, okay.
- Alright.

1534
01:27:14,707 --> 01:27:16,083
I'll see you soon, Ben?

1535
01:27:16,108 --> 01:27:18,070
Okay, let me know
where you end up.

1536
01:27:18,095 --> 01:27:19,189
- Alright.
- Okay.

1537
01:27:19,214 --> 01:27:20,622
Alright.

1538
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:33,261
Glad you're already
thinking about a visit.

1539
01:27:33,286 --> 01:27:36,242
I've been thinking
about a lot of things.

1540
01:27:36,267 --> 01:27:38,775
I'll be thinking about them too.

1541
01:27:39,358 --> 01:27:41,511
For a real long time.

1542
01:27:43,521 --> 01:27:45,955
And about you even longer.

1543
01:27:47,759 --> 01:27:49,972
I feel the same way too.

1544
01:27:49,997 --> 01:27:52,594
But,
I mean...

1545
01:27:53,095 --> 01:27:55,121
You're leaving, I mean,
we're just getting started.

1546
01:27:55,153 --> 01:27:58,866
I don't have any words of wisdom.
I wish I did.

1547
01:27:59,249 --> 01:28:03,755
All I know is that
you'll find your way.

1548
01:28:04,578 --> 01:28:06,899
And I hope you to.

1549
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,199
I'll keep an eye out
for you, ma'am.

1550
01:28:35,449 --> 01:28:37,191
Are you alright?

1551
01:28:39,785 --> 01:28:41,663
No, baby.

1552
01:28:43,647 --> 01:28:45,733
But, I'm gonna be.

1553
01:28:45,929 --> 01:28:47,882
I have you.

1554
01:28:49,547 --> 01:28:51,689
� My boyfriend's name is Billy, �

1555
01:28:51,714 --> 01:28:55,489
� He come from good, old Philly
with a cherry on his nose �

1556
01:28:55,514 --> 01:28:57,541
� And 10 big, fat toes, �

1557
01:28:57,566 --> 01:29:01,675
� And that's the way
my story goes. �

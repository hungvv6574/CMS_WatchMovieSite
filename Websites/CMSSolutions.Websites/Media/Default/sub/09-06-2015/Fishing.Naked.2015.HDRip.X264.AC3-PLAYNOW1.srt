1
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:28,398
ACT THREE FINALE.

2
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,447
FBI, KILLS BIGFOOT.

3
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:32,048
ACTION.
GET ON THE GROUND.

4
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,149
I'M NOT BIGFOOT.
GET DOWN.

5
00:00:33,249 --> 00:00:34,517
I'M NOT BIGFOOT. DON'T SHOOT.

6
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,086
GET DOWN.

7
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:40,011
WAIT A MINUTE, WHERE THE HELL
IS THE CREATURE?

8
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,190
OH, BOY.

9
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:36,195
WHAT THE HELL.

10
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,482
HEY, THERE, BUDDY?

11
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:40,617
LOOKS LIKE I CAUGHT
YOU IN THE MIDDLE.

12
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:42,717
OF YOUR MORNING BATH.

13
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,321
WELL, WHAT THE--NO, NO,
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

14
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:47,123
I'LL JUST HEAD FURTHER
DOWNSTREAM.

15
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:49,259
WHAT THE FUCK.

16
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,359
RUN.

17
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,613
HELP. HELP.

18
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,368
HELP.

19
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,203
BIGFOOT'S AFTER ME.

20
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:02,303
HELP.

21
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,350
BIGFOOT. RUN.

22
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,351
HEY, MAN.

23
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,352
I'M TYING A KNOT HERE.

24
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:17,353
DUDE, WE GOT TO RUN.

25
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:18,488
BIGFOOT'S COMING.

26
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:20,223
ACTUALLY,
YOU'VE GOT TO RUN.

27
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:21,458
I'M FIRST NATIONS.

28
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,226
I'VE GOT NO BEEF
WITH HAIRY MAN.

29
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,326
WHAT?

30
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,529
GET OUT OF HERE, MAN.

31
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,164
HELP.

32
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:30,264
BIGFOOT'S AFTER ME.

33
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,175
SON OF A BITCH,
THAT HURTS.

34
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,477
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

35
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,713
YEAH, WE REALLY GOT
HIM GOOD, BRO.

36
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:47,417
ONE LESS WEEKEND WARRIOR
IN OUR TROUT WATERS.

37
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:50,453
MAN, IS THIS SUIT
GETTING TIRED.

38
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:51,788
YEAH, I CAUGHT IT
ON A STICK.

39
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:52,856
I ALMOST RIPPED
THE WHOLE DAMN THING OFF...

40
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:54,457
...  ALONG WITH MY BALL SACK.

41
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:55,492
I THINK WE'RE
GOING TO NEED...

42
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,626
...       TO GET A NEW ONE.

43
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:57,727
NO, WE CAN PROBABLY
FIX IT UP...

44
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:59,229
...A FEW MORE TIMES.

45
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:03,366
MAN, THAT GUY
FUCKIN' LOST IT.

46
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,235
IT'S PRETTY AWESOME.

47
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:06,269
AND THAT LAST LINE
OF YOURS,

48
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,704
'YOU'RE TRESPASSING,'.

49
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,405
THAT IS HYSTERICAL, MAN.

50
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:10,607
YES.

51
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:14,022
YOU'RE A QUARTER WHITE,
MAN, LIGHTEN UP.

52
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,579
THERE'S NOT
GONNA BE ANY FISH...

53
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,515
...   FOR THE NEXT FEW HUNDRED
YARDS, AT LEAST.

54
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,849
YEAH, BUT I GOT HIM
WAY BEFORE THE MEAT HOLE.

55
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,217
SO WE'RE GOOD
FROM THERE UP.

56
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:22,585
COOL, BECAUSE
GRANDMA WANTS ME...

57
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,320
...       TO BRING HOME
A BUNCH OF FISH.

58
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,856
WHAT, NO CATCH
AND RELEASE, MR. PURIST?

59
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,857
NOT TODAY.

60
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,957
NOT TODAY.

61
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,912
DAVID?

62
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,502
DAVID.

63
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,602
ARE YOU HERE?

64
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,434
DAVID?

65
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:20,959
I HOPE HE REMEMBERS TO BRING
FISH BACK FOR OUR GUEST.

66
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,262
OH, SHIT.

67
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,497
DON'T LOOK AT 'EM.

68
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:42,532
WELL, THAT'S HIM.

69
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,434
THAT'S THE KID.

70
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,602
TELL HIM ABOUT BIGFOOT.

71
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,836
HEY, ART, WHAT'S UP?

72
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:48,671
NOW, TELL HIM
ABOUT BIGFOOT.

73
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:49,872
I'M SORRY, SIR.

74
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:50,974
WE JUST SAW A CRAZY GUY...

75
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:52,408
...   RUNNING DOWN THE STREAM.

76
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:53,643
YOU LOOKED PRETTY CRAZY.
YEAH.

77
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:55,411
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

78
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,713
STEVE JOBS.

79
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:57,780
OH, COME ON, KID.

80
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,982
THE CREATURE CHASED ME...

81
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,450
...    FROM HALF A MILE
DOWN THE RIVER.

82
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,287
WHAT'D YOU CALL HIM,
HAIRY MAN?

83
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,388
WHOA, MAN.

84
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,723
THAT'S ENOUGH.
TELL HIM.

85
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,391
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE RELEASE DAVID?

86
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:09,692
NO.
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO DOWN.

87
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,261
TO THE STATION...
I'M THE PRESIDENT...

88
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,895
...  OF FIRST FREAKING BANK,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

89
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:14,797
AND IF YOU GIVE US A FULL
REPORT, I'LL...

90
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,833
...     TELL HIM
WHAT YOU SAW OUT THERE.

91
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,401
I'M SORRY.
WE JUST SAW A CRAZY GUY...

92
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:21,271
...    MESSING UP OUR FISHING.
LET HIM GO.

93
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,406
ALL RIGHT,
PROBABLY SEEN A BEAR.

94
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:24,574
IT WASN'T A BEAR.

95
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:26,009
OKAY. IT WASN'T A BEAR.

96
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:28,878
YOU TWO, TAKE OFF,
AND I'LL GO FIND BIGFOOT.

97
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:30,013
HAIRY MAN.

98
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,514
HAIRY MAN.

99
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:33,716
I'LL GET YOU SOME
DRY CLOTHES, SOME FOOD,

100
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:37,469
AND MAYBE A SEDATIVE.

101
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,831
WHOA.

102
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,409
HEY, SARAH,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

103
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:34,644
NOTHING WITH YOU.

104
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,744
HI, DAVID.

105
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,581
SARAH.

106
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:40,681
BITCH.
DUDE.

107
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:42,118
SHE'S LIKE THE LAST
SINGLE GIRL IN TOWN.

108
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,419
THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE'S A BITCH.

109
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,069
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

110
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,625
GOD, IT WAS SUCH
A GOOD DAY TODAY, BRO.

111
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:50,993
WE SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF THAT TOURIST.

112
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:53,093
UH-HMM.

113
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,583
IT'S JUST LIKE
I WAS NEVER GONE.

114
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,605
WHAT?

115
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:04,807
IT'S COOL TO SCARE
A COUPLE OF TOURISTS,

116
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:06,075
BUT NEITHER ONE
OF US CAN AFFORD...

117
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,543
...    TO GET ARRESTED, AGAIN.

118
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,379
RELAX, MAN.
NOBODY KNOWS IT'S US.

119
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,014
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO GET CAUGHT.

120
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:14,384
RODNEY, YOU SHOULD
KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

121
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:17,153
THERE ARE NO SECRETS
IN THIS TOWN.

122
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:20,857
LOOK WHO'S TALKING, SLUT.

123
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:22,992
HOW'S FISHING TODAY?

124
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,160
PRETTY GOOD.

125
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,429
OKAY. RODNEY.
I HAVE FIVE FIRST TIMERS.

126
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,730
THRASHING ON THE RIVER TODAY.

127
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,166
AND I KNOW I STILL GOT
MORE FISH THAN YOU DID.

128
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,702
BULLSHIT.

129
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:35,705
YOU KNOW, GENIUSES,
IT IS FIRE SEASON.

130
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:36,839
DAVID, WHY DO YOU
HANG OUT WITH THIS PUNK?

131
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,040
HE JUST MAKES YOU STUPID.

132
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,542
I'LL BEAT YOU STUPID, RC.

133
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:41,711
SIT DOWN, RODNEY.
I'M JUST FUCKING WITH YOU.

134
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,811
HERE. WHAT IS THIS?

135
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,549
THAT WAS MY CHAI.

136
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:49,454
THANKS FOR THAT.
IT'S MOOSE URINE.

137
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,765
HI, GRANDMA OTTERTALE.

138
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:04,734
HI.

139
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,569
I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW MORNING.

140
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,171
I CAN'T.
HELPING MY DAD ALL DAY.

141
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,940
WHATEVER.
MORE FISH FOR ME.

142
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,642
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA GET BORED
WHEN YOU DON'T CATCH ANYTHING,

143
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,943
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO BE HOME EARLY.

144
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:16,043
NO.

145
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,217
DID YOU CATCH
ANY FISH?

146
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:22,585
OF COURSE.

147
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,554
DID YOU SEE
ANYTHING INTERESTING?

148
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:25,721
NO.

149
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:28,758
NOTHING OUT
OF THE ORDINARY. WHY?

150
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,794
I'VE SEEN AN ORB
LAST NIGHT.

151
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:32,795
YOU MEAN ONE OF
THE 'BRIGHT LIGHTS'

152
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:33,930
THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT...

153
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,231
...        AFTER SPENDING
TOO MUCH TIME...

154
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:36,599
...      IN THE SWEAT LODGE?

155
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:38,768
YES. IT WAS A GREEN ONE.

156
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,937
THEY ALWAYS COME FIRST.

157
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:43,239
NO ORBS, GRANDMA.

158
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:45,641
OKAY.

159
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,741
GOOD LUCK.

160
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,857
I BROUGHT HOME
A WHOLE BAG OF FRESH TROUT,

161
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,126
AND WE'RE EATING
FROZEN FISH STICKS.

162
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:06,545
THEY'RE FOR COMPANY.

163
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,782
WHAT COMPANY?

164
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,138
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

165
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:19,775
LOOKING FOR ORBS.

166
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,644
COME ON, GRANDMA.
YOU HAVE TO EAT.

167
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:22,845
BEFORE YOU TAKE
YOUR HEART MEDICINE.

168
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:25,648
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
YOU'RE SEEING ORBS.

169
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:29,285
I'M SEEING ORBS BECAUSE
SOMETHING IS GONNA HAPPEN.

170
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:31,921
EAT YOUR DINNER, PLEASE.

171
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,021
OKAY.

172
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,343
I GOT IT.

173
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,766
HEY, ART.

174
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,866
DAVID.

175
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,771
HELLO, LOUISE.

176
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:50,907
HEY, ARTHUR.
DO YOU WANT TO COME IN?

177
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,075
NO, THANKS. I HAVE A LOT
ON MY PLATE TONIGHT.

178
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,110
UH-HMM.

179
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,978
DID YOU SEE ANY ORBS?

180
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,547
NOT LATELY.

181
00:09:57,647 --> 00:09:59,282
I SAW A GREEN ONE
LAST NIGHT.

182
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:00,283
REALLY, WHAT TIME?

183
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:04,153
WHAT'S UP, ART?

184
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,956
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK...

185
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:09,692
...    BILL WAS HALLUCINATING
OUT THERE TODAY.

186
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,827
I DON'T KNOW.

187
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:12,828
CITY GUY,

188
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:14,330
NOT USED
TO THE FRESH AIR.

189
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,666
PROBABLY SAW A BEAR.

190
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,268
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT ALSO...

191
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:23,739
...      UNTIL HE MENTIONED
A HAIRY MAN, DAVID.

192
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,174
YOU SAW A HAIRY MAN?

193
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:26,609
NO, GRANDMA.

194
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,344
JUST SOME CRAZY TOURIST
HALLUCINATING.

195
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:29,679
THOUGHT HE SAW HIM.

196
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:30,980
HE PROBABLY DID...

197
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,715
...  BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY HERE.

198
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,052
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU
AND RODNEY DO ME A FAVOR...

199
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:39,889
...     AND JUST TAKE IT EASY
FOR A WHILE.

200
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:41,857
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO LAUNCH...

201
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,507
...    A FORMAL INVESTIGATION.

202
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,864
GOOD NIGHT, LOUISE.

203
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,232
GOOD NIGHT, ARTHUR.

204
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:53,135
COME AGAIN REAL SOON.

205
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,235
NIGHT, ART.

206
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,958
GOD, YOU'RE RUDE.

207
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,412
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

208
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:37,980
IT'S COLD.

209
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,115
SOMETHING'S GONNA BITE ME.

210
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:41,366
YOU ARE SUCH AS WUSS.

211
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:46,871
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

212
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,425
BITE YOU.
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE...

213
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,427
...       BUT TROUT AND ME,
THEY WON'T BITE.

214
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:52,695
NO.

215
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,413
I'M NOT BORED, RODNEY.

216
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,235
WOULD YOU PREFER
A SPONGE BATH, PRINCESS?

217
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:00,670
YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

218
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,371
GET IN THIS RIVER,
YOU STINK.

219
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,471
I DO NOT.

220
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,158
I CAN'T DO THIS.

221
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,685
WELL, HOWDY THERE,
STRANGER.

222
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:17,119
OH, HEY,

223
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:18,120
I'M SORRY.

224
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,955
I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

225
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,223
UH-HUH.

226
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,323
HOW ARE THEY BITING?

227
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:24,794
FEW LITTLE ONES.

228
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:26,162
NOTHING TO WRITE
HOME ABOUT.

229
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:29,832
YOU MUST BE USING
THE WRONG PATTERN.

230
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:31,734
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

231
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,469
WHAT? OKAY.

232
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:35,569
OF COURSE.

233
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,144
CADIS FLY?

234
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:43,813
REALLY?

235
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:46,015
DUDE, IT'S ALL NYMPHS
RIGHT NOW.

236
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,116
NYMPHS, HUH?

237
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:48,384
HERE.

238
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:52,137
LET ME SEE
WHAT WE HAVE HERE.

239
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,160
HERE WE GO.

240
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
THIS IS OUGHT TO DO IT.

241
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,298
YOU DO LIKE NYMPHS,
DON'T YOU?

242
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,415
I LOVE NYMPHS.

243
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,743
GIVE ME YOUR ROD.
WHAT?

244
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:16,846
YOU CAN'T CATCH A BIG FISH
UNLESS YOU'RE NAKED.

245
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:19,448
SO IF I DON'T GET ANYTHING
ON THIS NEXT CAST.

246
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,383
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
MY SKIRT OFF.

247
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:23,483
OKAY.

248
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,838
TOLD YOU.

249
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,142
YOU DO THIS OFTEN?

250
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,164
WHAT?

251
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:36,999
FISH NAKED.

252
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:40,936
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

253
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:42,538
HEY, I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T
CATCH YOUR NAME.

254
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:44,006
AMY.

255
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,442
COME ON OVER
AFTER YOU LOSE MY FISH.

256
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:50,707
NAKED HIPPIE CHICK TELLING ME
NOT TO LOSE MY FISH?

257
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,884
DAMN IT.

258
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,984
TOLD YOU.

259
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,195
ENJOY THE SHOW?

260
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:08,264
I WAS FISHING,
I WASN'T SPYING.

261
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:10,232
OH, RELAX, JEN.

262
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:12,001
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
SOMEONE WILL MASTURBATE...

263
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,202
...      TO THE THOUGHT OF
MY WET, NAKED BODY.

264
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:14,270
AMY.
I WAS...

265
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,972
...   RELAX, BOTH OF YOU.

266
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:19,408
TOTALLY INNOCENT ENCOUNTER.

267
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:21,076
NICE GEAR.

268
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:22,077
ALL RIGHT. COME ON.

269
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:24,177
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME.

270
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,198
LADIES FIRST.

271
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,327
HOME SWEET HOME.

272
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:39,328
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

273
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:40,362
WHAT'S THIS?

274
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,363
HOME.

275
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,032
SINCE WHEN?

276
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,100
OH, JEN AND I GRADUATED
LAST MONTH...

277
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,103
...AND DECIDED TO GO MINIMALIST
INSTEAD OF ENTERING THE MACHINE.

278
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:50,203
MINIMALIST, HUH?

279
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,408
SO, WHAT DID YOU TWO STUDY
TO DRIVE YOU OUT HERE?

280
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:54,610
AMY, PHILOSOPHY,
ME, MATHEMATICS.

281
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,314
AND I WANTED TO EXPLORE
MY ROOTS AS WELL.

282
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,249
NICE SATELLITE DISH.

283
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:01,984
IT'S JUST
FOR INTERNET ACCESS.

284
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:03,886
WE DON'T BELIEVE
IN TELEVISION.

285
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,986
OKAY. OKAY.

286
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:15,264
YOU GUYS AREN'T
EXACTLY ROUGHING IT.

287
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:16,999
NO ONE SAID YOU HAD TO BE
UNCOMFORTABLE...

288
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,133
...    TO COMMUNE WITH NATURE.

289
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:19,969
COMMUNING. YEAH.

290
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:22,789
YOU'RE JUST
A REGULAR POCAHONTAS.

291
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,509
OH, I LIKE YOUR LANDSCAPING.

292
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:28,510
OH, REALLY?

293
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,180
YOU LIKE OUR LANDSCAPING?

294
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,650
YEAH, I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE OUR LANDSCAPING.

295
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,118
OH, PLEASE.

296
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:38,683
I CAN HANDLE
YOUR LANDSCAPING.

297
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,195
I SAW THE FIRST STAR.

298
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:48,295
I GET TO MAKE A WISH.

299
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,367
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ALIEN USSES...

300
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,369
...    ON ANOTHER PLANET...

301
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:55,371
...      SOMEWHERE OUT THERE
LOOKING AT US...

302
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:57,907
...  AND WONDERING IF THERE ARE
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE UNIVERSE?

303
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,408
CLICHE.
I FEEL SO SMALL...

304
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,043
...   AND INSIGNIFICANT...

305
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:03,178
... WHEN I LOOK AT THE STARS.

306
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:05,278
CLICHE, CLICHE...

307
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,416
...       YOU ARE.

308
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,585
DON'T BE INSULTING.

309
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:11,020
I'M SERIOUS.

310
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,554
SO AM I.

311
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:15,658
WE ARE INSIGNIFICANT,
BUT WHO CARES?

312
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:17,393
WHEN YOU'RE INSIGNIFICANT.

313
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:22,253
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY HEAVY
RESPONSIBILITIES TO WORRY ABOUT.

314
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,535
WHAT?

315
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:29,104
LISTEN TO YOU, GUYS.

316
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,640
COME ON, I'M THE ONE
WITH A DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY,

317
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,442
AND YOU DON'T HEAR ME
GETTING ALL METAPHYSICAL...

318
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,210
... AND RUINING A PERFECTLY
DELIGHTFUL EVENING.

319
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,112
BE NICE.

320
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:39,448
OKAY. WHY DO YOU THINK
WE'RE HERE?

321
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:43,052
I DON'T KNOW,
AND REALLY, I DON'T CARE.

322
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:44,586
PHILOSOPHY IS CRAP.

323
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:46,221
IT'S NOT CRAP.

324
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,321
NOT CRAP.

325
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,559
YES, IT IS.

326
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,361
DON'T YOU GO TO SCHOOL
OR SOMETHING?

327
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,330
WHY SHOULD I?

328
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,565
I MEAN, YOUR DEGREES
AREN'T DOING YOU MUCH GOOD.

329
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:59,183
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

330
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,438
YOU'RE A LIAR.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

331
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:05,274
OH, SHIT, I GOT TO GO.

332
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:09,044
AW, DOES LITTLE DAVIE
HAVE A CURFEW?

333
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,380
I GOT TO GO CHECK
ON MY GRANDMA.

334
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,482
YOU HAVE TWO BEAUTIFUL.

335
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,684
HORNY WOMEN ALONE
IN THE WOODS.

336
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,120
AND YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO CHECK ON 'GRANDMA'?

337
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,989
WE'RE LONELY.

338
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,758
LOOK, IF I DON'T GIVE MY GRANDMA
HER MEDICINE, SHE WON'T TAKE IT.

339
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,153
SUIT YOURSELF.
I UNDERSTAND.

340
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,229
WE MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR YOU.

341
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,598
WE DON'T HAVE TO
TORTURE HIM THIS MUCH.

342
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:31,698
BUT IT'S SO FUN.

343
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,070
HE HAS TO TAKE CARE OF
HIS GRANDMOTHER.

344
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,672
OH, WAIT, I'M HORNY.

345
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:38,273
DAVID, WAIT A MINUTE.

346
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:40,342
DAVID, DAVID, WAIT A SECOND.

347
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:43,012
LOOK, I REALLY NEED
TO CHECK ON MY GRANDMA.

348
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,213
IT'S COOL.

349
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,781
AMY'S A TERRIBLE TEASE.

350
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:47,316
REALLY?

351
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,650
OKAY. ACTUALLY,
SHE'S NOT A TEASE.

352
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,586
SHE'D PROBABLY
FOLLOW THROUGH.

353
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:53,155
YEAH, THAT MAKES ME FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER.

354
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:54,523
DON'T WORRY,
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

355
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:56,258
JUST COME BACK
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

356
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:57,593
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH TOMORROW?

357
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:00,229
WE HAVE TO GO

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,385
SHE PROBABLY WON'T DIE
IF SHE JUST MISSES ONE.

364
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,733
OH, NO.

365
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,374
HEY, ART, WHERE THE HELL

00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,765

00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,257
HEY, ART,

00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,907
THINK YOU BETTER GET

377
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,876
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
YOUR ROBE?

378
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:22,744
I TOOK MY MEDICINE.

379
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:27,316
THAT'S GREAT, GRANDMA.

380
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,651
WHAT WAS ART DOING HERE
SO LATE?

381
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,520
HE'S JUST CHECKING ON ME.

382
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,455
I'M GONNA SLEEP

383
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:34,823
WHY?

384
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,675
I'M LOOKING FOR ORBS.

00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,802
ARE YOU SURE YOU NOT TAKING

386
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:47,836
YES.

387
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,505
SMELLS LIKE YOU ARE.

388
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,373
DID YOU GET ANY FISH?

389
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,473
YES.

390
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,359
JUST DOUBLE CHECKING.

391
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:59,381

392
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:01,481
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

393
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,550
FEEDING HAIRY MAN.

394
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,490
LET'S GO TO BED, GRANDMA.

395
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,661
I'M SLEEPING HERE TONIGHT
IN CASE ORBS COME.

396
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:15,297
GRANDMA, IT'S GONNA
BE COLD TONIGHT,

397
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:16,698
AND I WON'T BE
ABLE TO SLEEP...

398
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,234
...  IF I THINK YOU'RE OUT HERE
FREEZING TO DEATH.

399
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,147
I WON'T FREEZE
IF YOU GIVE ME.

400
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:22,355
MY BLANKET BACK.

401
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,455
COME ON.

402
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,926
SHIT.

403
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,416
YOU TREAT ME
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

404
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:36,667
I'M SORRY, GRANDMA.

405
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,835
YOU REALLY LIKE MESSING
WITH PEOPLE, DON'T YOU?

406
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:54,970
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

407
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,365
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
DAVID.

408
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,608
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GONNA
EXPLODE WHEN HE LEFT HERE.

409
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,677
IT'S GOOD TO KEEP
GUYS GUESSING.

410
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:02,778
GUESSING?

411
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:04,980
HE'S PROBABLY LYING IN BED...

412
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,615
...    IMAGINING THE TWO OF US...

413
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:10,370
...      IN THE THROES OF
CRAZY LESBIAN SEX.

414
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:14,346
I'D HATE TO LET
THE LITTLE GUY DOWN.

415
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,525
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

416
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,526
NICE TRY.

417
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,394
HEAD GAMES WITH GUYS, FINE,

418
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:20,963
BUT NOT WITH ME.

419
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:22,531
I GOT TO PEE.

420
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:26,535
YOU WANT TO EXPLORE
YOUR ROOTS WITH DAVID.

421
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,635
MAYBE.

422
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,807
SHE BETTER NOT BE THINKING
ABOUT EXPERIMENTING.

423
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:33,575
IT'S REALLY BAD ENOUGH I
HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUGS...

424
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:38,496
...    AND SNAKES,
AND OTHER CREEPY-CRAWLY SHIT.

425
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,031
I'M TIRED, AMES,
STOP MESSING AROUND.

426
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:58,533
I'M SERIOUS.

427
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,002
AMY, IT'S NOT POLITE...

428
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:03,622
...TO SHINE A LIGHT ON SOMEONE
WHEN THEY'RE PEEING.

429
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,722
THANK YOU.

430
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,584
WHEN DID YOU GET
THE GREEN FLASHLIGHT?

431
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:16,752
WHAT?

432
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:18,520
YOU KNOW.

433
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,057
THE GREEN LIGHT YOU WERE SHINING
ON ME WHEN I WAS PEEING.

434
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:24,059
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

435
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,029
YOU WEREN'T SHINING
A GREEN LIGHT ON ME?

436
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,531
I TOLD YOU
THAT WAS STRONG STUFF.

437
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:30,565
STOP MESSING WITH ME.

438
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:31,933
I DIDN'T SMOKE THAT MUCH.

439
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:34,303
I THINK YOU DID.

440
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:36,338
SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE NOT
MESSING WITH ME?

441
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,874
NO.

442
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:41,310
THAT IS SOME
GOOD LANDSCAPING.

443
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,410
MM-HMM.

444
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,403
WATCH THOSE RACCOONS, GRANDMA.

445
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:10,503
I MIGHT BE LATE.
OKAY.

446
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:11,907
YOU'LL TAKE
YOUR MEDICINE, RIGHT?

447
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,007
OKAY.

448
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:16,745
WHAT?

449
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,013
OH, AREN'T YOU GOING TO WISH...

450
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:20,082
...   YOU CAME FISHING
WITH ME YESTERDAY.

451
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:23,412
BETTER THAN SLAVE
LABORING WITH MY DAD?

452
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,500
OW.
GET OUT.

453
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,501
WHY?

454
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:40,902
GET THE FUCK OUT.

455
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,838
YOU'RE SMOKING HERB
WITH NOT ONE BUT TWO...

456
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,474
...  HOT, NAKED HIPPIE CHICKS
ALL DAY AND YOU ASK ME WHY?

457
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:47,709
YOU SHOULD'VE CALLED ME,
YOU ASSHOLE.

458
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:48,810
UGH.

459
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,911
OW, FRICK YOU, MAN.

460
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:50,912
YEAH, IT BURNS.

461
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,814
I DIDN'T HAVE A PHONE.

462
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:55,804
WELL, THEN
YOU SHOULD'VE FOUND ONE.

463
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,021
SERIOUSLY, DUDE,
WHAT THE FUCK?

464
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:01,957
YOU LUCKY BASTARD.

465
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:06,461
THAT'S LIKE--THAT'S LIKE
'PENTHOUSE' FORUM SHIT.

466
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,897
IT REALLY WASN'T
THAT EXCITING.

467
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:11,600
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T SEAL THE DEAL?
NO.

468
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,909
I HAD TO MAKE SURE
MY GRANDMA TOOK.

469
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:13,419
HER MEDICINE.

470
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,871
OH, MAN. YOUR PRIORITIES
ARE SO MESSED UP.

471
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:18,106
OKAY, WHATEVER.
NO.

00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,875
OKAY, WHERE ARE WE GOING?

473
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:21,176

476
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,683
OKAY. WE'LL GO TO SOUTH FORK.

477
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:30,986
SOUTH FORK?

478
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:33,855
THE FISHING SUCKS,
AND IT'S FULL OF TOURISTS.

479
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:35,090
EXACTLY.

480
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,959
TIME TO GENERATE
SOME MEDIA CRED.

481
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,478
OH, YOU'RE GOOD, YOU.

482
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,007
MAN, YOU ARE A MESS.

483
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,842
RC.
- YEAH, BOB.

484
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:55,610
HEY, RC, I'M KIND OF
HUNG-UP HERE.

485
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,945
COULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

486
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:58,647
YOU KNOW, BOB, PART
OF BEING A FLY-FISHERMAN.

487
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,649
IS LEARNING HOW TO GET
YOURSELF UNTANGLED THERE.

488
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,718
I'D CUT YOU LOOSE, BUT I'D BE
DOING YOU A DISSERVICE.

489
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:05,086
HEY, RC.

490
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:07,756
ANY LUCK TODAY?

491
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:11,511
MAN, THESE ARE GONNA BE
SO GREAT ON MUGBOOK.

492
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,161
NEVER MIND.

493
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,830
YEAH. HEY, IT'S GOOD TO SEE
YOU'RE NOT JOINED.

494
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,798
TO THE HIP WITH
THAT CRIMINAL, DAVID.

495
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:18,233
COME ON, MAN.

496
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,935
THAT WAS
A BULLSHIT CHARGE,

497
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:21,169
AND YOU KNOW IT.

498
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,170
YEAH, BULLSHIT CHARGE.

499
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,839
HE STEALS ART'S PATROL CAR.

500
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,873
AND DRIVES THROUGH
THE POST OFFICE.

501
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:26,775
AND THAT'S
A BULLSHIT CHARGE.

502
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,085
NO ONE SAW HIM.
YEAH, OKAY.

503
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:30,812
HEY, DAVID, WHEN ARE YOU
COMING BY THE SHOP?

504
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:32,714
I'M OUT OF
STIMULATORS, PARACHUTES.

505
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:34,206
WOOLY BUGGERS.
AND I'M LOW ON.

506
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:35,067
EVERYTHING ELSE.

507
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,785
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS?
OKAY.

508
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:38,885
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

509
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,954
HAIRY MAN.

510
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,194
OH, SHIT. DAVID, REALLY?

511
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,164
YOU MIGHT KNOW HIM
AS BIGFOOT.

512
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:51,099
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

513
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,901

SOUTH FORK RIVER.

518
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,744
WE GOT A PHOTO OF IT.

519
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:04,179
YES, THAT'S RIGHT, CHET.

520
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,748

521
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:08,917

TOURISTS THINK

530
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,570
HOLY SHIT.

531
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,305
NO.
- CHARLIE MURPHY.

532
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:32,741
CHARLIE MURPHY,
YOU WERE THE ONE RESPONSIBLE.

533
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,277
NOW THAT LOOKS LIKE A
VERY FANCY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.

534
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:37,112
WITH NO DUE RESPECT, SIR,

535
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:40,682
WHY IS THIS PHOTO SO BLURRY?

536
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:44,586
WELL, THE--I HAD ON
A REALLY WIDE LENS,

537
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,756
AND THE CREATURE.
THIS BIG HAIRY THING...

538
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,591
... LOOKED AND MOVED MORE LIKE
AN APE THAN A MAN.

539
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,560
HE WAS REALLY WAY UPSTREAM...

540
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,228
... AND I MIGHT HAVE HAD THE--
I MIGHT HAVE KNOCKED...

541
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:55,630
...   THE AUTO-FOCUS OFF
IN THE EXCITEMENT,

542
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,006
BUT WHAT I'M GONNA DO
IS I'M GONNA GET MY.

543
00:26:57,106 --> 00:26:57,650
REALLY LONG LENS,

544
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,234
AND I'M GONNA COME BACK
OUT HERE EVERY DAY...

545
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:01,069
...UNTIL I GET A BETTER PICTURE.
EVERY DAY?

546
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,737
NOW, WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO BE OUT HERE EVERY DAY?

547
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:03,905
TO GET A BETTER PICTURE.

548
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:06,657
WHAT A DOUCHE BAG.

549
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,725
HOW CLOSE ARE WE GETTING?

550
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:26,227
RIGHT UP AROUND THE BEND,
JUST CHILL.

551
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:28,129
NICE.

552
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,229
I SAID CHILL.

553
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,370
THEY WERE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM...

554
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,105
... JUST OFF THAT LITTLE PATH
BY THE ROCK.

555
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:38,306
WELL, THEY'RE NOT THERE NOW.

556
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,708
WHAT ARE YOU FELLAS
LOOKING FOR?

557
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:41,242
OH, AMY, JEN.
WE WERE JUST...

558
00:27:41,342 --> 00:27:43,078
... HOPING TO FIND HER NAKED
IN THE RIVER?

559
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:45,178
YES.
NO.

560
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,284
THIS IS RODNEY.
WHAT'S UP, LADIES?

561
00:27:49,384 --> 00:27:50,919
WOW.

562
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:52,320
A NEW FAN.

563
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,255
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
TOO DISAPPOINTED, RODNEY.

564
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:55,657
OF COURSE NOT.

565
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,258
YOU KNOW, DAVID,
THIS MAKES TWO STRIKES.

566
00:27:57,358 --> 00:27:59,094
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

567
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:00,996
WELL, YOU DIDN'T COME
BY YESTERDAY.

568
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,633
JEN AND I JUST HAD
TO SATISFY EACH OTHER.

569
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:07,035
JEN SAID YOU GUYS
WERE GOING INTO TOWN.

570
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:08,837
SILLY, SILLY BOY.

571
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,905
AND TODAY, YOU BROUGHT A FRIEND
WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION.

572
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:13,005
I'M RODNEY.

573
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:14,309
OKAY, I'M RODNEY.

574
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:16,144
AMY. AND THIS IS JEN.

575
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:17,846
NICE TO MEET YOU.

576
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:18,947
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THOSE LINES.

577
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,342
HAVE BEEN IN THE WATER YET.

578
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,284
SINCE YOU'RE NOT FISHING,

579
00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:26,104
YOU CAN HELP US
WITH OUR LAUNDRY.

580
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,956
I'M NOT REALLY
A LAUNDRY GUY.

581
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:29,958
OH, REALLY?
THAT'S TOO BAD.

582
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:34,648
I HAVEN'T TAKEN OFF EVERYTHING
I NEED TO WASH JUST YET.

583
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,081
NICE TO SEE YOU
HARDLY WORKING, RODNEY.

584
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:54,382
WELL, I'M KEEPING BUSY.

585
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,482
I SEE THAT.

586
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,154
DAVID UNDERSTANDS
HOW TO TREAT WOMEN.

587
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:02,957
WE CAN BE VERY GRATEFUL
TO MEN LIKE HIM.

588
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:04,325
HEY, DAVID.

589
00:29:04,425 --> 00:29:06,975
DO YOU MIND WASHING THIS, TOO?

590
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,401
MAY I HAVE MY VEST BACK?

591
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,501
NO.

592
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,570
SO, DAVID.

593
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,374
YOU'RE FIRST NATIONS, RIGHT?

594
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:20,375
MOSTLY.

595
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:22,844
MOSTLY?

596
00:29:22,944 --> 00:29:26,915
MY GRANDFATHER'S WHITE,
BUT I NEVER MET HIM.

597
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,183
WHY?

598
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:29,751
DAMN GIRL, YOU'RE NOSY.

599
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,019
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T HELP IT.

600
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,420
I WAS RAISED IN THE CITY.

601
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,322
I'M GUESSING
IT WASN'T THE PROJECTS.

602
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:37,759
WHAT TRIBE
DO YOU BELONG TO?

603
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,097
ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT MY HERITAGE.

604
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,966
DO YOU WANNA HEAR
MY STORY?

605
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,334
YEAH, PLEASE.

606
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:48,870
HERE WE GO.

607
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,372
MY GRANDFATHER
WAS A RODEO CLOWN...

608
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:54,409
...  WITH A PENCHANT FOR
FOUR-LEGGED COMPANIONSHIP.

609
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:59,080
HE MET AN UNTIMELY DEMISE
WHEN HE WAS CRUSHED BY A BULL.

610
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,381
MY MOTHER GOT KNOCKED UP...

611
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:02,951
...   BY HER UNIVERSITY
FIRST NATIONS T.A.

612
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,853
FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE.

613
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:06,254
AS SOON AS I WAS BORN,

614
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:08,857
THEY SPLIT
FOR AN ASHRAM IN FRANCE.

615
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:11,126
MY CHILDHOOD WAS TYPICAL.

616
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,895
TROUT FISHING
AND SWEAT LODGES.

617
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,131
EACH SPRING, WE'D MIGRATE DOWN
TO THE LOWLANDS...

618
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,966
... WHERE WE WOULD TRAP MOOSE...

619
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,101
...  AND DANCE NAKED UNDER
THE LUNAR ECLIPSES...

620
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:22,804
...  COMMITTING PAGAN ACTS
OF DEFIANCE.

621
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,240
PRETTY STANDARD
FIRST NATIONS STUFF, REALLY.

622
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,109
HE'S JERKING YOUR CHAIN, JEN.

623
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,344
DON'T MOCK HIM, AMY.

624
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:31,813
IT'S ALL TRUE.
RIGHT.

625
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,382
IT IS.
SERIOUSLY, IT'S ALL TRUE.

626
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:37,552
TRAPPING MOOSE?

627
00:30:37,652 --> 00:30:39,345
MY GRANDFATHER
WAS A RODEO CLOWN.

628
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:40,740
WHO GOT CRUSHED BY A BULL.

629
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,023
SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

630
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:46,394
I'M AFRAID
THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE.

631
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:48,494
THAT'S SO SAD.

632
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,125
YOUR LIFE IS THE WEIRDEST.

633
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,941
HEY, DAVID.

634
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,876
DAMN, YOU ARE SUCH A TEASE.

635
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:03,111
WOO.

636
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:05,313
GOD, YOU GUYS DID
A TERRIBLE JOB WASHING.

637
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:07,549
STILL SMELLS
LIKE A BAG OF ASSHOLES.

638
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:10,351
I DON'T THINK
IT'S YOUR CLOTHES.

639
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,187
I THINK SOMETHING
DIED IN THE WOODS.

640
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,287
GROSS.

641
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,967
DUDE.
- I TOLD YOU.

642
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:29,170
OH, SO YOU DON'T WANT US
FOR OUR BODIES, JUST OUR POT?

643
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,270
BOTH, PLEASE.

644
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,607
SO, WHAT ARE THESE ORB THINGS?

645
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,911
I DON'T KNOW.

646
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:38,847
LIKE I SAID,
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE.

647
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:41,149
IS IT LIKE 'CLOSE ENCOUNTERS'
KIND OF STUFF...

648
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:42,984
...       OR LIKE 'X-FILES'
KIND OF STUFF?

649
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:44,953
THEY'RE DESCRIBED
AS GLOWING BALLS OF LIGHT.

650
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:46,955
THAT MOVE THROUGH THE SKY.

651
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:48,156
WHAT COLOR ARE THEY?

652
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:50,291
WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED?

653
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:52,260
I THOUGHT AMY WAS SHINING
A FLASHLIGHT ON ME...

654
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,462
...    WHEN I WAS PEEING
AFTER YOU LEFT THE OTHER DAY.

655
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:56,631
SHE SAID
I WAS HALLUCINATING.

656
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:59,000
YOU THINK IT WAS AN ORB?

657
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,435
COULD BE.

658
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:03,171
BUT MOST PEOPLE
THAT CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN THEM.

659
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:06,040
ARE HALLUCINATING
ON A PRETTY REGULAR BASIS.

660
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,209
GREAT.

661
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:11,012
OH.

662
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:12,180
WOW.

663
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,916
I LIKE THESE.

664
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,317
MINE.

665
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:17,986
REALLY?

666
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:20,989
AMY LIKES TO GO COMMANDO.

667
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:23,925
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

668
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,360
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

669
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,961
GOT SOMETHING
OUT OF MY STUDIES.

670
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:29,063
A LITTLE MINOR
IN HORTICULTURE.

671
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:30,632
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
STICK AROUND FOR DINNER?

672
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:32,600
WE CAN GET BAKED
AND TELL UFO STORIES.

673
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,700
WORKS FOR ME.

674
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,543
THEN THE HAIRY.
GROTESQUE ARM...

675
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:47,233
... REACHED UNDER HER COVERS
TO HER MILKY WHITE BREAST.

676
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,351
SHE TRIED TO SCREAM OUT.

677
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:53,221
BUT WAS OVERCOME
BY HIS EXTRATERRESTRIAL LUST.

678
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:55,957
BEING TELEPATHICALLY
PROJECTED INTO HER MIND.

679
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,526
AND SHE GRATEFULLY...
OH, MAN.

680
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,094
THAT IS WORSE
THAN GHOST STORIES.

681
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:03,169
I HEARD AT MIDDLE SCHOOL
SLEEPOVERS.

682
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,518
IT'S KIND OF SPOOKY.

683
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,121
I GOT TO PEE.

684
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,267
HELLO, TRUSTY ROCK.

685
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,380
COME ON, GUYS,
A LITTLE PRIVACY.

686
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,285
JEEZ, LOUISE,
TURN OFF THE FLASHLIGHT.

687
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,157
HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT?

688
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:04,726
BETTER GHOST STORY
THAN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS.

689
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:07,295
I SAW AN ORB.

690
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:09,163
YOU DIDN'T SEE THE LIGHTS?

691
00:34:09,263 --> 00:34:11,263
NO, NO LIGHTS.

692
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:13,668
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN
HALLUCINATING AGAIN, SWEETHEART.

693
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:15,370
BULLSHIT. YOUR SHIT
ISN'T THAT GOOD.

694
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,238
I'M FREAKING OUT HERE.

695
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:18,639
WE'RE LIVING OUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

696
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,799
AND I'M GETTING BUZZED
BY ALIEN ORBS.

697
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,511
WAS IT THREATENING?

698
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:25,780
YEAH, IT HOVERED OVER ME
WHILE I WAS PEEING.

699
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,516
I'D HOVER OVER YOU PEEING,
WHILE YOU WERE PEEING.

700
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:30,451
SHUT UP, RODNEY.

701
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:33,354
I'M GOING TO BED.

702
00:34:33,454 --> 00:34:34,655
BEDTIME.

703
00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:37,274
ALONE.

704
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,153
NO, MAN, I'M GOOD.

705
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,610
DENIED, HUH?

706
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,745
THEY'RE CITY GIRLS.

707
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:02,250
WE'RE JUST NOT
REAL OPTIONS FOR THEM.

708
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,318
I'M NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP
THAT EASILY, BUDDY.

709
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:07,622
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT GIVING UP.

710
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:08,823
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

711
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:11,292
BOOM.
YEAH.

712
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:12,593
THAT'S GOOD SHIT.

713
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,263
SURE GOT JEN
ALL FREAKED OUT.

714
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,664
I DON'T KNOW.

715
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:19,434
I WAS WATCHING HER.
AND I DON'T THINK.

716
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,103
SHE TOOK
A REAL DRAG ALL NIGHT.

717
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,604
WHAT, YOU THINK
SHE FAKED IT?

718
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,374
SHE SEEMED LIKE
SHE WAS REALLY FREAKED.

719
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,276
SHE PROBABLY
JUST SAW AN OWL.

720
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,211
CHICKS ARE CRAZY.

721
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:31,212
YEAH.

722
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:33,312
I DON'T KNOW.

723
00:35:33,347 --> 00:35:36,322
GRANDMA SAID SHE SAW
ONE LAST NIGHT.

724
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,287
BRO, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

725
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,297
YOUR GRANDMA IS CRAZIER
THAN BAT-SHIT PANCAKES.

726
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,463
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR HAIRY MAN...

727
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,466
...    TO PAY OUR NEW FRIENDS
A VISIT.

728
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,668
MAN, JEN GETS
SCARED AGAIN...

729
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:56,637
... AND I THINK
SHE'S JUST GONE.

730
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,407
SO, YOU DON'T THINK
THE CHANCE OF A THREE-WAY...

731
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:01,809
...        IN THE WOODS
IS WORTH THE RISK?

732
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,909
THINK ABOUT IT.

733
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,646
HUH?

734
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:09,851
WELL, WHEN YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY, IT MIGHT WORK.

735
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:12,286
YEAH, YOU BET YOUR ASS
IT'LL WORK, MAN.

736
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:15,356
AS SOON AS THEY SEE HAIRY MAN.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SO GRATEFUL...

737
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:16,724
...     FOR YOUR PROTECTION,

738
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:19,494
THEY'RE GOING
TO BE LIKE, 'UHHHHH.'

739
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,762
AM I RIGHT?
OH, YEAH.

740
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:24,332
SQUID.

741
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,432
REALLY?

742
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,050
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

743
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,537
DID YOU CATCH
ANY FISH?

744
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,754
OH, SHIT.

745
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,591
DID YOU TRIP?

746
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:09,677
YES, GRANDMA.

747
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:11,946
I TRIPPED.

748
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:15,216
WHY THE HELL ARE YOU
SITTING IN THE DARK?

749
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,486
I'M WATCHING ORBS.

750
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:21,622
GREAT. MORE ORBS.

751
00:37:21,722 --> 00:37:23,722
NO, JUST ONE.

752
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:25,359
YOU SAW ANOTHER ORB?

753
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:26,661
MM-HMM.

754
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:30,198
I LIKE THE BLUE ONES.

755
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:32,567
WHAT TIME DID YOU SEE IT?

756
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,667
JUST A FEW HOURS AGO.

757
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:38,239
IT JUST ZIPPED BY
LIKE IT WAS SCARED.

758
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,441
A SCARED ORB?

759
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,210
MM-HMM.

760
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,540
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
WITH THE LIGHT ON.

761
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:52,553
SO, DID YOU AND RODNEY
GET LAID TONIGHT?

762
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:55,489
GRANDMA.

763
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:56,657
NO.

764
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:58,459
OH.

765
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,628
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

766
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:02,812
YOU BOTH COULD USE IT.

767
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,406
JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP TAKING
YOUR MEDS, LOUISE.

768
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:14,506
I WILL.

769
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,947
HEY, GRANDMA.
I JUST NEED TO ASK...

770
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,482
...  THE DOCTOR A COUPLE
OF QUESTIONS.

771
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:23,584
I'M FINE.

772
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:24,785
WHY DON'T YOU
FRESHEN UP...

773
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,420
...       AND I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE LOBBY?

774
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,922
FINE, I GET IT.

775
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:29,890
DON'T LET HIM COMMIT ME,
OKAY, SHARON?

776
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,990
I WON'T, LOUISE.

777
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,697
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER, DOC.

778
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:37,999
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE.

779
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:39,400
SHE'S GOING
TO OUT-LIVE US BOTH.

780
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,035
SO LONG AS SHE KEEPS
TAKING HER MEDS.

781
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:42,803
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT HER PHYSICAL HEALTH.

782
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:46,040
SHE'S STARTING TO LIVE LIKE
SHE IS IN THE OLD LEGENDS.

783
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,842
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

784
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:51,895
SHE SAYS SHE'S SEEING
ORBS AND...

785
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,515
...       ...HAIRY MAN.

786
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:56,350
ARE YOU SURE
SHE'S NOT SEEING THEM?

787
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,286
THERE HAVE BEEN
A FEW SIGHTINGS RECENTLY.

788
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:00,554
OH, SHE THINKS THAT SHE'S
THAT SHE'S SEEING THEM.

789
00:39:00,654 --> 00:39:02,523
SHE'S BEEN A LITTLE ECCENTRIC
SINCE I WAS A KID.

790
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:05,359
I'D ROLL WITH IT.

791
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:07,395
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO TO STOP IT?

792
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:11,699
I DON'T THINK SHE HAS
ANYTHING TO TREAT.

793
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:12,867
I TELL YOU WHAT.

794
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:14,702
IF ANYTHING CHANGES,
LET ME KNOW.

795
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:17,938
AND WE'LL EXPLORE
SOME OPTIONS.

796
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:19,340
OKAY.

797
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,408
THANKS.

798
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:22,508
OF COURSE.

799
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,687
I'M NOT CRAZY.

800
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,722
I NEVER SAID
YOU WERE CRAZY, GRANDMA.

801
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:36,590
BUT YOU THINK I AM.

802
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,426
YOU ARE SEEING
THINGS, GRANDMA.

803
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:39,727
UH-HUH.

804
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:41,529
HALLUCINATIONS
AREN'T REAL.

805
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,998
I'M NOT HALLUCINATING.

806
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:47,101
YOU ARE SEEING ORBS
AND TALKING TO HAIRY MAN.

807
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:48,502
UH-HUH.

808
00:39:48,602 --> 00:39:49,670
NO ONE ELSE IS SEEING ORBS.

809
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,405
OR TALKING TO HAIRY MAN.

810
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:53,741
HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK
TO ANYONE ELSE.

811
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:55,509
HE'S ON VACATION.

812
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:57,649
AND IT'S NOT MY FAULT...

813
00:39:57,678 --> 00:40:00,448
...     NO ONE TAKES THE TIME
TO LOOK AWAY...

814
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:01,849
...   FROM THEIR TV LONG ENOUGH...

815
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:05,619
...    TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND THEM.

816
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,655
HAIRY MAN IS ON VACATION?

817
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:09,056
UH-HUH.

818
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,059
DO ME A FAVOR,
ASK IF I CAN TALK TO HIM.

819
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,427
I DON'T THINK SO.

820
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:14,595
WHY NOT?

821
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:16,430
BECAUSE HE'S ON VACATION,

822
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,882
AND YOU'RE NOT RELAXED.

823
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,519
ALL RIGHT, GRANDMA.

824
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,519
AMY?

825
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,490
JEN?

826
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,652
AMY?

827
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:13,752
JEN?

828
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,879
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

829
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,716
WELL, THIS SUCKS.

830
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,005
THEY'RE PROBABLY
JUST OUT BANGING BANKERS.

831
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:32,940
WAY TO BE THE OPTIMIST.

832
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,141
I'M A REALIST.

833
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,110
WHATEVER, LET'S JUST GO.

834
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,611
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S GETTING LATE.

835
00:41:37,711 --> 00:41:38,679
THEY'LL PROBABLY
BE BACK SOON.

836
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:40,047
OR THEY JUST LEFT.

837
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:41,081
GUESS I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TAKEN SO LONG...

838
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:42,516
...   CATCHING ALL THESE FISH.

839
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:43,984
THAT'S WHAT
I TOLD YOU, MAN.

840
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,120
THAT'S LIKE TWO DAYS
WORTH OF TROUT, NOT DINNER.

841
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,549
OKAY, WHATEVER.
LET'S JUST GET.

842
00:41:47,649 --> 00:41:48,573
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

843
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,673
FINE.

844
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,464
THEY WERE DEFINITELY
HOPING TO FIND US BOTH NAKED.

845
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:57,898
SHIT, THEY'RE HERE.

846
00:41:57,998 --> 00:41:59,533
HIDE.

847
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:00,935
SERIOUSLY?

848
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:03,471
THEY'RE, LIKE, STANDING
IN THE WATER?

849
00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:05,573
OBVIOUSLY, LIKE, THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

850
00:42:05,673 --> 00:42:07,673
BRAS ARE NOT IN HERE.

851
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,877
OF COURSE I
CAN BELIEVE IT,

852
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:11,779
THEY'RE A COUPLE
OF PUNK-ASS JERKS.

853
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:13,013
HELLO, LADIES.

854
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,181
YOU STARTLED ME.

855
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,850
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

856
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,500
I JUST CAUGHT
SOME NICE FISH...

857
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:20,120
...     AND THOUGHT I'D BRING
THEM BY FOR DINNER.

858
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,756
NICE TIMING. WE JUST WENT
TO TOWN FOR GROCERIES.

859
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:25,693
SO, SEE ANY MORE ORBS
LAST NIGHT?

860
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,793
DON'T TEASE ME.

861
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,031
MY GRANDMA SAW
SOME LAST NIGHT.

862
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,968
SHE LIKES THE BLUE ONES.

863
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:35,536
THE ONE I SAW WAS BLUE.

864
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,005
REALLY?
YES, REALLY.

865
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:39,080
I DIDN'T SLEEP
A MINUTE LAST NIGHT.

866
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:39,958
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME.

867
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,675
I MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY
SEEN SOMETHING?

868
00:42:41,775 --> 00:42:42,877
I DON'T KNOW.

869
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,245
I JUST KNOW
MY GRANDMA SAW ONE.

870
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:45,779
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

871
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:47,548
LOOK, JEN,
WE WENT TO TOWN.

872
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,216
YOU'VE HAD YOUR PEDICURE
AND YOUR FACIAL.

873
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,218
WE'VE GOT GROCERIES,
EVERYTHING IS GOOD.

874
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,754
I'M TELLING YOU BOTH,
I SAW SOMETHING.

875
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:54,788
MAYBE YOU DID.

876
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:57,106
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS...

877
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,244
MAYBE SOMEONE'S
MESSING WITH US.

878
00:43:01,295 --> 00:43:02,630
AMY.

879
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,099
COME BACK HERE,
YOU LITTLE FUCKER.

880
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:09,364
OH, MY GOD. DON'T CHASE
THAT THING INTO THE WOODS.

881
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,018
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

882
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:26,118
SHE'LL BE BACK SOON.

883
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,510
SHE COULD BE DEAD
RIGHT NOW.

884
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,973
I'M PRETTY SURE
THE CREATURE...

885
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:49,983
...    IS IN MORE DANGER
THAN SHE IS RIGHT NOW.

886
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,750
I'LL KILL YOU.
OKAY, OKAY, I GIVE, I GIVE.

887
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,850
RODNEY?

888
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,322
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

889
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:03,123
BIGFOOT SUIT.

890
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,858
OW, OW, OW.
DIRTY BITCH. OW, OW.

891
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,208
THAT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG.

892
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,084
AMY?.

893
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,372
RODNEY HERE IS
PRETTY OUT OF SHAPE...

894
00:44:18,472 --> 00:44:20,472
...   FOR A YOUNG GUY.

895
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,012
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

896
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:26,347
LOOKS LIKE OUR
TWO NEW FRIENDS...

897
00:44:26,447 --> 00:44:28,349
...  WERE TRYING TO SCARE
THE HELL OUT OF US.

898
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:29,650
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

899
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,130
IT WAS A BAD IDEA.
I'M SORRY.

900
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:34,755
BAD IDEA? THAT IS
WAY BEYOND A BAD IDEA.

901
00:44:34,855 --> 00:44:36,724
OH, JEN, ACCORDING
TO RODNEY HERE,

902
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,659
WE SHOULD BE FLATTERED.
WHAT?

903
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,127
RODNEY WAS TAKING ONE
FOR THE TEAM AND HOPING...

904
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:41,895
...  HE MIGHT SCARE US BOTH
INTO DAVID'S ARMS.

905
00:44:41,995 --> 00:44:43,864
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

906
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:47,364
THAT IS THE DUMBEST IDEA
I'VE EVER HEARD.

907
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:49,870
YOU DON'T GET TO LAUGH.

908
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:50,971
I GUESS THAT'S SORT
OF FLATTERING...

909
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,073
...     IN A PREPUBESCENT
SORT OF WAY.

910
00:44:53,173 --> 00:44:54,408
THIS IS QUITE THE PLOT...

911
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:57,044
...    YOU HATCHED OUT
TO GET A LITTLE LOVIN'.

912
00:44:57,144 --> 00:44:59,647
WE JUST FIGURED SINCE JEN
SAW THAT ORB THE OTHER NIGHT.

913
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,747
WE'D GIVE IT A SHOT.

914
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:03,417
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
USING THE SAME GAG.

915
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:04,952
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

916
00:45:05,052 --> 00:45:06,353
YOU MEAN THERE ARE
OTHER BEAUTIFUL GIRLS...

917
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,155
...    OUT HERE IN THE WOODS?

918
00:45:08,255 --> 00:45:11,570
WE WISH. YOU GUYS ARE
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

919
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,295
I THINK YOU LIKE
DOING THAT.

920
00:45:15,395 --> 00:45:17,965
WE'RE SCARING FISHERMEN
OUT OF OUR FAVORITE WATERS.

921
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:20,100
AND ATTRACTING
THE MEDIA TO...

922
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,804
'BIGFOOT SIGHTINGS'
ON CRAPPY WATERS.

923
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:25,904
YOU'RE KIDDING?

924
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:29,977
OKAY, SCARING GIRLS
INTO SEX, STUPID.

925
00:45:30,077 --> 00:45:31,945
MANIPULATING TOURISTS,

926
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:34,045
FUCKIN' BRILLIANT.

927
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,399
IT'S WORKING, TOO.

928
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:39,820
WE WERE ON THE EVENING NEWS
A COUPLE OF NIGHTS AGO.

929
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,155
WE'RE REALLY CAREFUL
WHO WE CHOOSE.

930
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:42,723
MOSTLY BUSINESSMEN
FROM THE FRONT PLAINS...

931
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,092
...      BECAUSE THEY DON'T
WANT TO LOOK CRAZY.

932
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:46,460
KIND OF LIKE PILOTS...

933
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,328
NOT WANTING TO REPORT UFOS.
- YEAH.

934
00:45:48,428 --> 00:45:49,997
AND THE NEWS MEDIA ASSUMES
LIGHTNING WILL STRIKE...

935
00:45:50,097 --> 00:45:52,199
...     THE SAME PLACE TWICE.
EXACTLY.

936
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:53,967
YOU GUYS JUST MIGHT
BE ONTO SOMETHING.

937
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:55,169
BUT WE CAN DIAL THIS
UP A NOTCH...

938
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:58,005
... AND REALLY HAVE SOME FUN.

939
00:45:58,105 --> 00:46:00,105
HOW?

940
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:05,112
I'M JUST, YOU KNOW,
WANDERING ALONE IN THE WOODS,

941
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:07,337
BY MYSELF, LATE AT NIGHT.

942
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,298
OH, MY GOD.
THERE IT IS AGAIN.

943
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,351
OH, WHERE IS IT?

944
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:16,957
WHERE'D IT GO?

945
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:19,359
OH, MY GOD. I CAN HEAR--...

946
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:20,961
... WHERE IS IT COMING FROM?

947
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:23,097
OH, GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME.

948
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,597
I DON'T WANNA DIE,
I HAVEN'T HAD SEX YET.

949
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,268
OH, GOD.

950
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,770
DID YOU SEE IT?

951
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,271
I HEAR SOMETHING.

952
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,107
JUST GOT TO BE QUIET.

953
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,742
JUST REALLY QUIET.

954
00:46:34,842 --> 00:46:36,110
OH, GOD.

955
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,845
NO, NO.

956
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:39,947
OH, MY GOD, WHERE IS IT?.

957
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,098
I'M SO SCARED.

958
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,486
THAT IS AWESOME.

959
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:47,121
GREAT WORK, AMY.

960
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,089
THANKS.

961
00:46:49,189 --> 00:46:50,924
DAVID?

962
00:46:51,024 --> 00:46:52,860
IT'S A LITTLE CLOSE
TO HOME.

963
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,795
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF WE WANT TO DRAW.

964
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,530
THAT MUCH ATTENTION
TO OURSELVES.

965
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,332
HEY, YOU STARTED
THIS LITTLE SCAM.

966
00:46:58,432 --> 00:47:00,167
I KNOW, BUT YOUTUBE?

967
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,267
DON'T BE SUCH A PUSS.

968
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:03,270
UPLOAD IT.

969
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:06,260
YOU'RE STILL
ON PROBATION, JACKASS.

970
00:47:06,306 --> 00:47:08,306
RODNEY?

971
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,445
IT WAS NOTHING.
I WAS JUST BEING...

972
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:12,946
...    STUPID AND GOT CAUGHT.

973
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:14,081
FORGET IT.

974
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:16,181
DOING WHAT?

975
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,119
JOYRIDING.

976
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:21,054
OOF, YOU ARE A DANGEROUS,

977
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:23,154
DANGEROUS CRIMINAL.

978
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:25,156
IN ART'S PATROL CAR,

979
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:26,827
THROUGH THE POST OFFICE...

980
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:27,995
...      AND INTO THE RIVER.

981
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,863
OH, MY GOD, REALLY?

982
00:47:29,963 --> 00:47:32,166
YES.

983
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,201
THE OTHER THING
HE ISN'T TELLING YOU IS.

984
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:37,437
THAT I WAS WITH HIM.
AND HE TOOK ALL THE HEAT.

985
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:40,574
EVEN THOUGH THAT MEANT
HE DID A FEW YEARS IN JAIL.

986
00:47:40,674 --> 00:47:43,243
YOU WERE ALREADY 18,
BRO, I WAS NOT, SO...

987
00:47:43,343 --> 00:47:45,644
... PLUS, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THEY WOULD TRY.

988
00:47:45,744 --> 00:47:46,397
ME AS AN ADULT?

989
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,282
YEAH.

990
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:52,319
BRO, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO GET CAUGHT.

991
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:54,221
LET'S DO THIS.

992
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:55,556
DAVID?

993
00:47:55,656 --> 00:47:57,124
C'MON.

994
00:47:57,224 --> 00:47:58,826
ALL RIGHT.

995
00:47:58,926 --> 00:48:01,094
YES.

996
00:48:01,194 --> 00:48:03,297
AND AWAY IT GOES.

997
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:06,117
WE'RE GONNA BE
SO FUCKIN' FAMOUS.

998
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,505
OKAY, DID YOU SEE THAT?

999
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:12,573
OH, GOD...

1000
00:48:12,673 --> 00:48:14,174
...THAT IS WHAT I SAW.

1001
00:48:14,274 --> 00:48:15,542
IT SCARED
THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF ME,

1002
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:19,112
BUT OBVIOUSLY
IT'S SOME KIND OF HOAX.

1003
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:20,848
HOLY SHIT.

1004
00:48:20,948 --> 00:48:22,948
OH, MY GOD.

1005
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,303
DAVID, WAKE UP.

1006
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,174
DAVID, WAKE UP.

1007
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:37,564
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

1008
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,566
I'VE BEEN WATCHING
THE HITS ALL NIGHT.

1009
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,034
WHAT?
THE YOUTUBE HITS.

1010
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:43,370
WE'RE OVER 500,000
AND RISING FAST.

1011
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,872
OH, SHIT.

1012
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:46,640
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'OH, SHIT'?
THIS IS AWESOME.

1013
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,565
GO, GET YOUR CLOTHES ON.
WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

1014
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,270
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

1015
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,562
OKAY. OH, NICE.

1016
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:09,963
NEW SUIT LOOKS GOOD,
RODNEY.

1017
00:49:10,063 --> 00:49:11,465
WHY, THANK YOU.

1018
00:49:11,565 --> 00:49:14,067
OKAY, EVERYONE.
SYNCHRONIZE YOUR ALARMS...

1019
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:17,004
...   FOR EXACTLY FIVE
MINUTES FROM NOW.

1020
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:18,405
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
RODNEY,

1021
00:49:18,505 --> 00:49:20,340
JUST TAKE YOUR CUES
FROM DAVID AND JEN.

1022
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,909
I WANT YOU TO WORK
YOUR WAY UPSTREAM...

1023
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:23,277
...    TO THAT BEND
AND STAY OUT OF SIGHT.

1024
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,178
I'M GOING TO MAKE MY WAY
DOWN TO THE NEWS CREW.

1025
00:49:25,278 --> 00:49:27,314
DAVID, CROSS THE RIVER
ABOVE THAT BEND...

1026
00:49:27,414 --> 00:49:28,916
...    AND THEN WORK
YOUR WAY HALF WAY...

1027
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:30,584
...    BETWEEN RODNEY
AND THE NEWS CREW DOWNSTREAM.

1028
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:31,919
STAY HIDDEN.

1029
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:33,553
I'M PRETTY SURE THIS WAS...

1030
00:49:33,653 --> 00:49:35,055
...    MY SCAM TO START WITH.

1031
00:49:35,155 --> 00:49:37,324
WELL, WE'RE DIALING IT
UP A NOTCH.

1032
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:41,295
SO YOU'VE SAID.

1033
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,562
C'MON, LET'S GO.

1034
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:45,297
THIS IS GONNA BE
GONNA BE GREAT.

1035
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,209
OKAY, DUDE.
MEDIUM SHOT.

1036
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:57,644
THEN YOU PAN OVER
TO THE RIVER. READY?

1037
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,744
THREE, TWO, ONE.

1038
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,615
HORROR IN THE HIGH COUNTRY.

1039
00:50:01,715 --> 00:50:03,717
WHERE ONE NAME
STRIKES FEAR.

1040
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:05,619
IN THE HEARTS OF
ALL THE RESIDENTS HERE.

1041
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:07,487
ON THE SOUTH FORK RIVER.
SWEETHEART.

1042
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:11,558
WHERE ARE YOU?

1043
00:50:11,658 --> 00:50:15,262
I'M SO LONELY, SWEETY.
CUT, CUT, CUT.

1044
00:50:15,362 --> 00:50:16,730
WHERE ARE YOU?.
EXCUSE ME, MISS, MISS?

1045
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,665
SWEETY? HI, HONEY, LISTEN.
HI.

1046
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,100
WE'RE WORKING ON
AN IMPORTANT STORY.

1047
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,268
JUST GIVE ME
A FEW MINUTES, OKAY?

1048
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:22,669
OH...

1049
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,004
OKAY.
KEEP GOING. HERE WE GO.

1050
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,639
THREE, TWO, ONE.

1051
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:27,441
WHERE JUST THE NAME,
BIGFOOT, CAN STRIKE...

1052
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,009
...     SWEETY.

1053
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,210
CUT.
HONEYBUN.

1054
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:33,447
SWEETHEART, LOVER,
WHERE ARE YOU?

1055
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:36,650
MISS, MISS, LISTEN, WE'RE DOING
A BIGFOOT STORY, OKAY?

1056
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,452
OH.

EFFORTS TO CONTACT MR. WILLIAMS
HAVE GONE UNANSWERED.

00:53:16,509 --> 00:53:19,824
WHAT THE HELL

1136
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,941
HEY, DAVID, WHAT'S UP?

COPYING BAD IDEAS
OFF THE INTERNET?

1199
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:53,300
THE INTERNET IS A GREAT
SOURCE FOR INSPIRATION.

1224
00:56:53,793 --> 00:56:56,763
WOOO. OH, SHRINKAGE.

1225
00:56:56,863 --> 00:56:57,964
WHOO.

1226
00:56:58,064 --> 00:57:01,368
WHOA. HA HA.

1227
00:57:01,468 --> 00:57:04,571
I SAW THAT PICTURE OF YOURS
ON THE NEWS. NICE WORK.

1228
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,707
THANKS, BUT A PROFESSIONAL
WOULD KNOW IT WASN'T VERY GOOD.

1229
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:08,708
I KIND OF SCREWED UP.

1230
00:57:08,808 --> 00:57:12,846
NAH, YOU, YOU GOT THE SHOT.

1231
00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:15,081
I'M JEN.
HEY, I'M CHARLIE.

1232
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,649
ARE YOU PART
OF DAVID'S TRIBE?

1233
00:57:16,749 --> 00:57:18,051
NO, I'M FROM CALIFORNIA.

1234
00:57:18,151 --> 00:57:19,486
YOU'RE A PHOTOGRAPHER?

1235
00:57:19,586 --> 00:57:21,586
WE COULD BE NEIGHBORS.

1236
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:23,690
I'M FROM ORANGE COUNTY. O.C.

1237
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,392
O.C..

1238
00:57:25,492 --> 00:57:28,027
ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN
AN ACCOUNTANT FOR 20 YEARS.

1239
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:29,963
BUT AS SOON AS I TOOK
THAT FIRST PICTURE.

1240
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:31,431
I KNEW MY TRUE CALLING.

1241
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,900
SO NOW I'M A WILDLIFE
PHOTOGRAPHER.

1242
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,102
GOOD THING. YOU'RE JUST--
YOU'RE SO SNEAKY.

1243
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,071
THANKS.

1244
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:39,873
I FIGURED THE HARDEST
ANIMAL TO GET.

1245
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:41,474
IS HAIRY MAN,
BIGFOOT.

1246
00:57:41,574 --> 00:57:43,176
WHATEVER,
SO HERE I AM.

1247
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:44,978
HERE YOU ARE.

1248
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:46,446
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
HIM TODAY, HAVE YOU?

1249
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,081
NOT TODAY.

1250
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:52,585
BUT THERE ARE SOME TRACKS
LEADING THAT WAY.

1251
00:57:52,685 --> 00:57:54,421
OH, HELL. THANKS.

1252
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:56,521
GO GET 'EM, CHARLIE.

1253
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,843
WHOO. THIS IS...

1254
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:06,733
...HEY.

1255
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,968
HEY. HOW ARE THE TRACKS?

1256
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,603
THIS GUY
WITH LIKE FIVE CAMERAS...

1257
00:58:10,703 --> 00:58:12,505
...ACTUALLY STARTED FOLLOWING US.

1258
00:58:12,605 --> 00:58:13,940
WE LED HIM IN CIRCLES
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

1259
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,575
WE FINALLY HAD TO CROSS
THE RIVER A FEW TIMES...

1260
00:58:15,675 --> 00:58:17,510
...  AND THEN DOUBLE BACK
JUST TO GET AWAY FROM HIM.

1261
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,610
CHARLIE.
WHAT?

1262
00:58:19,646 --> 00:58:21,206
HE'S THE GUY WHO TOOK
THAT FIRST PHOTO THAT.

1263
00:58:21,306 --> 00:58:22,066
ENDED UP EVERYWHERE.

1264
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,166
THAT'S TOO FUNNY.

1265
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:29,589
HEY.
HOW WAS THE FISHIN'?

1266
00:58:29,689 --> 00:58:30,990
WE CAUGHT A LOT OF FISH.

1267
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,090
REALLY?

1268
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,671
WHEW.

1269
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,647
AND THE GAME
JUST GOT INTERESTING.

1270
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,699
THAT WAS THEM.

1271
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,799
OBVIOUSLY.

1272
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,890
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

1273
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,791
I'M GOING TO GO CHECK
ON GRANDMA.

1274
00:59:38,891 --> 00:59:40,159
GRANDMA'S FINE.

1275
00:59:40,259 --> 00:59:41,661
IT'S GOING TO BE
A FULL MOON TONIGHT.

1276
00:59:41,761 --> 00:59:43,963
AND I'M FEELING
KIND OF ROMANTIC.

1277
00:59:44,063 --> 00:59:45,732
THAT'S A REALLY
GREAT OFFER BUT...

1278
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,267
...     HEY, GUYS. WHAT'S UP?

1279
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:48,701
HEY.

1280
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:51,304
WE WENT FISHING
THIS AFTERNOON. YOU?

1281
00:59:51,404 --> 00:59:53,973
OH. WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS...

1282
00:59:54,073 --> 00:59:55,241
... TO DIAL IT UP ANOTHER NOTCH.

1283
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,543
YEAH, BABY.

1284
00:59:56,643 --> 00:59:58,278
WE ARE GOING TO FAKE...

1285
00:59:58,378 --> 01:00:00,547
...    A UFO LANDING.
WHAT?.

1286
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:03,049
RODNEY AND I BOUGHT A BUNCH OF
WEATHER BALLOONS, SOME HELIUM,

1287
01:00:03,149 --> 01:00:04,584
A COUPLE OF REMOTE
CONTROL UNITS,

1288
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,019
AND SOME COLOR
CHANGING L.E.D. LIGHTS.

1289
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:07,086
WE'RE GOING TO FLOAT THEM...

1290
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,555
...   IN THAT CLEARING
OUTSIDE OF TOWN...

1291
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:10,757
...   AND SCARE THE CRAP
OUT OF EVERYONE.

1292
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,092
IT'LL BE THE PERFECT FINALE
TO OUR YOUTUBE SERIES.

1293
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,162
AMY, HOW DID YOU PAY
FOR ALL THIS UFO STUFF?

1294
01:00:16,262 --> 01:00:18,164
I USED YOUR CREDIT CARD.
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

1295
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:21,234
AND HOW MUCH
DID EVERYTHING COST?

1296
01:00:21,334 --> 01:00:23,334
SLIGHTLY UNDER 10 K.

1297
01:00:23,403 --> 01:00:24,771
JEN'S LOADED, BRA.

1298
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,606
GOD DAMN IT. WE'VE
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

1299
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,142
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
PAYING FOR OUR LIVING SUPPLIES.

1300
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:32,132
BUT $10,000 ON TOYS?
WHAT THE FRIK.

1301
01:00:32,178 --> 01:00:33,780
SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE, RIGHT?

1302
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,114
BESIDES YOU'RE JUST
AS INTO THIS AS I AM.

1303
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,316
YOU PAID FOR
THE NEW HAIRY MAN SUIT.

1304
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:37,817
NO, I'M NOT.

1305
01:00:37,917 --> 01:00:39,886
IT HAS BEEN FUN.
BUT A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS.

1306
01:00:39,986 --> 01:00:42,088
IS A HELL OF A LOT DIFFERENT
THAN 10,000 FUCKING DOLLARS.

1307
01:00:42,188 --> 01:00:44,123
SLIGHTLY LESS THAN
10,000 FUCKING DOLLARS.

1308
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,959
AND SINCE WHEN
DID YOU GIVE A SHIT?

1309
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,161
SINCE I HAVE A BOYFRIEND AND
STARTED DISCOVERING MY ROOTS,

1310
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:50,597
THAT'S SINCE WHEN.
I AM NOT...

1311
01:00:50,697 --> 01:00:52,131
...   SHUT UP, DAVID.
YOU TELL HIM, BABY.

1312
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,967
FUCK YOU, RODNEY.
WELL, TAKE IT EASY, BUDDY.

1313
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,969
OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING
TO SIDE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

1314
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,637
AND WHO DO YOU THINK
IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND?.

1315
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,805
YOU.
OH, NO, DUDE.

1316
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,273
I AM SO NOT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

1317
01:01:00,373 --> 01:01:02,208
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO LEAVE...

1318
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:04,310
...    SO THAT I CAN
BE ALONE WITH DAVID...

1319
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,712
... SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS.

1320
01:01:05,812 --> 01:01:06,846
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?
YES.

1321
01:01:06,946 --> 01:01:08,615
FINE.
NO, NO DON'T LEAVE.

1322
01:01:08,715 --> 01:01:10,817
WHY NOT, BRO? YOUR GIRLY FRIEND
IS BEING A BITCH TO MINE.

1323
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:15,167
SHE IS NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
I AM NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

1324
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,925
WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN
STANDING OUT...

1325
01:01:19,025 --> 01:01:21,060
...  IN THAT RIVER WITH YOU
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE COLD...

1326
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,630
...  AND WET AND COVERED
WITH FISH.

1327
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:26,834
AND I SURE AS HELL HAVEN'T
BEEN DRIVING YOU AROUND.

1328
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,685
ALL DAY BECAUSE I WANTED TO.

1329
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:31,119
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

1330
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,243
DO YOU GUYS SMELL FISH?

1331
01:01:37,343 --> 01:01:39,712
I HAVE BEEN SMELLING FISH
FOR A WEEK NOW.

1332
01:01:39,812 --> 01:01:42,957
NOT LIKE THAT.
I MEAN LIKE STALE FISH.

1333
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:48,321
AH,

1334
01:01:48,421 --> 01:01:52,125
JESUS, YOU'RE A BRANCH.

1335
01:01:52,225 --> 01:01:54,727
YOU'RE A BRANCH.

1336
01:01:54,827 --> 01:01:56,827
OW. PRICKLY.

1337
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,540
GRANDMA,
THIS IS AMY AND JEN.

1338
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,252
HELLO.

1339
01:02:19,352 --> 01:02:20,787
HELLO.
HELLO.

1340
01:02:20,887 --> 01:02:22,722
HELLO, GRANDMA OTTERTALE.

1341
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,822
HELLO, RODNEY.

1342
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,161
DID YOU BRING ANY FISH?

1343
01:02:28,261 --> 01:02:30,261
HAIRY MAN LIKES FISH.

1344
01:02:30,263 --> 01:02:31,397
YES, WE DISCOVERED THAT.

1345
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,832
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

1346
01:02:32,932 --> 01:02:34,333
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COOKIES?

1347
01:02:34,433 --> 01:02:37,770
OH, NO, THANK YOU.

1348
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,338
WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANYWAY.

1349
01:02:39,438 --> 01:02:42,475
BUT WHITE PEOPLE LIKE COOKIES.

1350
01:02:42,575 --> 01:02:46,279
THANKS, GRANDMA.

1351
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:48,373
WE'RE HERE TO TALK
ABOUT THE ORBS.

1352
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,266
AND HAIRY MAN.

1353
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:51,217
ARE THEY ALIENS?

1354
01:02:51,317 --> 01:02:52,785
ARE THE ORBS
AND HAIRY MAN TOGETHER?

1355
01:02:52,885 --> 01:02:54,287
OR DO THEY JUST COINCIDE
WITH EACH OTHER?

1356
01:02:54,387 --> 01:02:56,387
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

1357
01:02:56,422 --> 01:02:57,457
CALIFORNIA.

1358
01:02:57,557 --> 01:02:59,557
THAT MAKES SENSE.

1359
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,163
GRANDMA,
WE SAW HAIRY MAN.

1360
01:03:04,263 --> 01:03:05,765
AND IT SCARED
THE CRAP OUT OF US.

1361
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,867
WHY?

1362
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:12,004
WELL, A THREE-FINGERED CREATURE
JUST CAME AND TOOK OUR FISH.

1363
01:03:12,104 --> 01:03:13,039
HE LIKES FISH.

1364
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:14,373
YES, WE GATHERED THAT.

1365
01:03:14,473 --> 01:03:16,175
WE JUST WANT
TO KNOW WHAT HE IS.

1366
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:17,877
AND WHERE HE CAME FROM.

1367
01:03:17,977 --> 01:03:19,178
WHY?

1368
01:03:19,278 --> 01:03:20,813
GRANDMA OTTERTALE...

1369
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:23,216
...    PLEASE, CALL ME LOUISE.

1370
01:03:23,316 --> 01:03:25,485
WHY THE FUCK DO THEY
ALWAYS CALL ME GRANDMA?

1371
01:03:25,585 --> 01:03:28,054
I'M ONLY 55.

1372
01:03:28,154 --> 01:03:29,388
SORRY, GRANDMA.

1373
01:03:29,488 --> 01:03:31,891
OKAY, LOUISE, IT'S JUST--...

1374
01:03:31,991 --> 01:03:33,304
...  IT'S IMPORTANT
BECAUSE IT CALLS.

1375
01:03:33,404 --> 01:03:34,344
SO MANY THINGS INTO PLAY.

1376
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:36,529
LIKE, WHERE ARE WE FROM,
WHY ARE WE HERE?

1377
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:38,798
KNOWING SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS
WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND...

1378
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,299
... OUR PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE.

1379
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,935
AMY'S GOT HER DEGREE
IN PHILOSOPHY.

1380
01:03:43,035 --> 01:03:45,035
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

1381
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:48,023
SEE THOSE GEESE?

1382
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:51,911
DO YOU EVER WONDER
WHY THERE'S MORE...

1383
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:55,666
...    ON THE RIGHT SIDE
THAN THE LEFT SIDE?

1384
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:02,121
IT'S BECAUSE MORE GEESE
DECIDED TO FLY ON THAT SIDE...

1385
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:04,516
...    THAN THE OTHER SIDE.

1386
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,527
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.

1387
01:04:07,627 --> 01:04:10,163
YOU'RE LOOKING TOO HARD.

1388
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:13,266
OKAY. THERE MUST BE A REASON
WHY ALL THIS IS HAPPENING.

1389
01:04:13,366 --> 01:04:15,366
HE'S JUST FISHING.

1390
01:04:15,401 --> 01:04:16,369
WHAT?

1391
01:04:16,469 --> 01:04:18,905
IT'S GOOD FISHING HERE.

1392
01:04:19,005 --> 01:04:21,005
OH, MY GOD.

1393
01:04:21,007 --> 01:04:23,876
HE'S A TOURIST?

1394
01:04:23,976 --> 01:04:25,144
IT'S LIKE ALL
THE WEEKEND WARRIORS...

1395
01:04:25,244 --> 01:04:26,445
... IN DAVID AND RODNEY'S
FISHING HOLES.

1396
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:28,080
HE'S HERE TO FISH.
AND HE WANTS...

1397
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,349
... TO AVOID THE LOCALS
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

1398
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,885
THEY'VE BEEN COMING
A LONG TIME.

1399
01:04:32,985 --> 01:04:36,022
WELL, HOW LONG?
A LONG TIME.

1400
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,292
I'M GONNA TAKE SOME FISH TO HIM
TONIGHT IF YOU WANNA ASK HIM.

1401
01:04:39,392 --> 01:04:43,029
BUT HE DOESN'T TALK.

1402
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,865
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
AN ALIEN FISHERMAN FISH?

1403
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:49,365
I DON'T THINK THIS ONE'S
VERY GOOD AT IT.

1404
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,852
OH, LOUISE,
THAT'S OUR HOME.

1405
01:05:05,952 --> 01:05:07,353
UH-HUH,
YOU'RE NEIGHBORS.

1406
01:05:07,453 --> 01:05:10,022
THAT'S THE DEN
RIGHT THERE.

1407
01:05:10,122 --> 01:05:11,357
WE LIVE NEXT
TO HAIRY MAN?

1408
01:05:11,457 --> 01:05:13,457
I GUESS SO.

1409
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:23,169
IS HE IN THERE?

1410
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:24,470
HE'S SHY.

1411
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:27,800
I'LL GO UP FIRST
SO HE KNOWS IT'S OKAY.

1412
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,052
I HOPE YOU CAUGHT
FISH TODAY.

1413
01:05:40,152 --> 01:05:42,521
BUT I BROUGHT SOME MORE
JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T.

1414
01:05:42,621 --> 01:05:45,596
I BROUGHT SOME FRIENDS
WITH ME, TOO.

1415
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:55,301
THIS IS MY GRANDSON, DAVID.

1416
01:05:55,401 --> 01:05:56,402
HELLO.

1417
01:05:56,502 --> 01:05:58,271
AND HIS FRIEND, RODNEY.

1418
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,572
WHAT'S UP, HAIRY MAN?

1419
01:05:59,672 --> 01:06:02,562
AND THEIR GIRLFRIENDS,
JEN AND AMY.

1420
01:06:02,608 --> 01:06:04,110
OH, WE'RE NOT
THEIR GIRLFRIENDS.

1421
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,344
WE THOUGHT WE'D COME BY.

1422
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:07,079
AND WELCOME YOU
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

1423
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:08,648
JEN AND I LIVE
NEXT DOOR, I GUESS.

1424
01:06:08,748 --> 01:06:11,213
YOU WERE AT OUR HOME EARLIER.

1425
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:13,953
MAY I?

1426
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,053
SURE.

1427
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:20,526
I CAN'T SEE HIM.

1428
01:06:20,626 --> 01:06:22,626
HE'S SHY.

1429
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,666
HAIRY MAN'S A GIRL.

1430
01:06:26,766 --> 01:06:29,201
HAIRY GIRL?

1431
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:33,139
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

1432
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,440
SHE COULD BE.

1433
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,944
SHE'S A LOT BIGGER THAN
MOST OF THEM.

1434
01:06:38,044 --> 01:06:39,245
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

1435
01:06:39,345 --> 01:06:41,480
I DON'T KNOW.
IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD.

1436
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,983
MUST BE SOME SORT
OF ALIEN PHEROMONE.

1437
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:47,993
THERE'S A LOT OF PHEROMONE
AROUND HERE TONIGHT.

1438
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:53,426
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

1439
01:06:53,526 --> 01:06:55,161
WHAT'S UP?.

1440
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,195
GET DOWN.

1441
01:06:56,295 --> 01:06:57,463
OW.

1442
01:06:57,563 --> 01:06:59,265
IT'S A BLACKHAWK.

1443
01:06:59,365 --> 01:07:01,400
IF HE'S OUT HERE THIS LATE,
HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

1444
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,369
THEY'VE GOT NIGHT VISION,
FORWARD-LOOKING INFRARED,

1445
01:07:03,469 --> 01:07:05,058
AND A WHOLE BUNCH
OF OTHER STUFF YOU DON'T.

1446
01:07:05,158 --> 01:07:06,089
EVEN WANT TO KNOW ABOUT.

1447
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,308
I JUST HOPE THEY DIDN'T SEE
THE LIGHT COMING OUT OF THE DEN.

1448
01:07:09,408 --> 01:07:11,243
HOW THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW ALL THAT?

1449
01:07:11,343 --> 01:07:12,445
I GREW UP IN GERMANY...

1450
01:07:12,545 --> 01:07:15,081
...   AT THE ARMY'S HELICOPTER
COMMAND HQ.

1451
01:07:15,181 --> 01:07:17,483
YEAH, A LOT OF HIPPIE CHICKS
ON MILITARY BASES, RIGHT?

1452
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:19,318
I'M NOT BIG ON AUTHORITY.

1453
01:07:19,418 --> 01:07:21,418
WHY ARE WE HIDING?

1454
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:24,123
WHO'S BEEN MAKING ALL
THE HEADLINES?

1455
01:07:24,223 --> 01:07:25,524
US.

1456
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:30,396
WE JUST LED THE MILITARY
TO HAIRY GIRL BY ACCIDENT.

1457
01:07:30,496 --> 01:07:31,664
SHE'S ALONE.

1458
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:32,765
ALL SHE COULD DO IS HIDE...

1459
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:35,568
... IF THEY COME LOOKING FOR HER.

1460
01:07:35,668 --> 01:07:37,069
SHE WAS DROPPED OFF.

1461
01:07:37,169 --> 01:07:39,205
SHE HAS TO WAIT
FOR HER FRIENDS.

1462
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:43,437
I'M AFRAID THEY WON'T COME
IF THEY'RE BEING CHASED.

1463
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:45,537
BY THE ARMY.

1464
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,147
AND THE SEARCH CONTINUES
FOR A CITY MAN,

1465
01:07:48,247 --> 01:07:49,749
CHARLIE MURPHY.
- YEAH.

1466
01:07:49,849 --> 01:07:52,118
FRIENDS SAY AFTER
PURCHASING A NEW CAMERA...

1467
01:07:52,218 --> 01:07:54,186
UH-HUH.
- ...HE HAD BECOME OBSESSED...

1468
01:07:54,286 --> 01:07:56,122
...WITH PHOTOGRAPHING THE ELUSIVE...

1469
01:07:56,222 --> 01:07:57,423
...  BIGFOOT OF SOUTH FORK.

1470
01:07:57,523 --> 01:07:59,058
WHEN I WAS TAKING COURSES...

1471
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,060
...   AT THE ARAPAHONSUIT
COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

1472
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,629
MY PROFESSOR TOLD ME THERE
THAT THE THING YOU NEED TO DO...

1473
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:06,065
... IS FIND YOUR COMPOSITION.
FIX YOUR LENS...

1474
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,440
...AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE
HAPPENS IN PHOTOSHOPING.

1475
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:09,052
AFTERWARDS.

1476
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:11,237
AND WHY HAVEN'T
YOU ARRESTED THEM?

1477
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:12,691
...TO FLY SEARCH
AND RESCUE OPERATIONS.

1478
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:13,290
DAY AND NIGHT...

1479
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,241
... NO, NO. LISTEN.
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

1480
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,376
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE
STUPID SONS A BITCHES.

1481
01:08:17,476 --> 01:08:19,612
ARE GETTING LOST IN THE WOODS
TRYING TO FIND THIS HOAX,

1482
01:08:19,712 --> 01:08:22,248
THAT'S WHY.

1483
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:23,582
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

1484
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:25,384
FRIENDS
ARE VERY CONCERNED.

1485
01:08:25,484 --> 01:08:28,220
HE HAS VERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE
IN THE WILDERNESS,

1486
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,723
BARELY KNEW HOW
TO OPERATE HIS NEW CAMERA,

1487
01:08:30,823 --> 01:08:32,725
AND THEY HOPE
HE HAD NOT BEEN DRINKING.

1488
01:08:32,825 --> 01:08:34,393
FINE, THEN WE'LL SET UP A STING...

1489
01:08:34,493 --> 01:08:36,262
... AND CATCH THEM IN THE ACT,

1490
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,698
WHATEVER YOU FBI GUYS DO.

1491
01:08:39,798 --> 01:08:42,117
OF COURSE I'LL PARTICIPATE.

1492
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:52,192
KNOCK, KNOCK.

1493
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,313
GO AWAY, RODNEY.

1494
01:08:54,413 --> 01:08:55,514
DON'T BE SUCH A BITCH.

1495
01:08:55,614 --> 01:08:57,614
COME ON IN, RODNEY.

1496
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:02,455
MIND IF WE TALK?

1497
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:03,522
ABOUT WHAT?

1498
01:09:03,622 --> 01:09:06,158
ABOUT YOU BEING A TEASE.

1499
01:09:06,258 --> 01:09:07,326
PISS OFF, RODNEY.

1500
01:09:07,426 --> 01:09:08,561
HE DOESN'T DESERVE THAT.

1501
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:10,496
YOU ARE A TEASE.

1502
01:09:10,596 --> 01:09:12,364
I'M A TEASE?

1503
01:09:12,464 --> 01:09:14,464
YEAH, YOU ARE.

1504
01:09:14,533 --> 01:09:16,039
I SEE. WELL.
I GUESS THAT'S BETTER.

1505
01:09:16,139 --> 01:09:17,187
THAN BEING DELUSIONAL.

1506
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:19,772
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

1507
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:21,640
BOTH OF YOU.

1508
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:23,642
YOU FOR THINKING THAT
YOU STOOD A CHANCE WITH ME,

1509
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:26,445
AND YOU FOR THINKING THAT
YOU STOOD A CHANCE WITH DAVID.

1510
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:31,390
OH, COME ON, YOU KNOW DAMN
WELL YOU'D BE LUCKY TO HAVE ME.

1511
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:34,666
YOU'RE PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER.

1512
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:53,739
OH, AMY.

1513
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,875
LOUISE.

1514
01:09:55,975 --> 01:09:57,843
I'M SORRY,
I WAS LOOKING FOR DAVID.

1515
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,813
UM, HE'S IN HIS ROOM.

1516
01:10:00,913 --> 01:10:02,548
DO YOU MIND IF I COME IN?

1517
01:10:02,648 --> 01:10:04,866
NO, NO, NO, COME ON IN.

1518
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:09,822
COOKIES?

1519
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:11,922
OH, NO, THANKS.

1520
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,325
I'M SORRY, WHERE IS HE?

1521
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:14,493
UPSTAIRS.

1522
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:16,593
THANKS.

1523
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:20,247
DAVID?

1524
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,436
AMY. WHAT'S UP?

1525
01:10:24,536 --> 01:10:26,338
RODNEY CAME BY
TO CALL ME A TEASE...

1526
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:27,881
... AND THEN JEN JOINED IN
AND CALLED ME A TEASE.

1527
01:10:27,981 --> 01:10:28,191
SO I LEFT...

1528
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:29,642
...   AND NOW I'M PISSED OFF
BECAUSE I'M NOT A TEASE,

1529
01:10:29,742 --> 01:10:32,344
AND I SHOULD HAVE
MADE THEM BOTH APOLOGIZE.

1530
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:33,445
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

1531
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:35,948
WELL, YOU-YOU ARE A TEASE.

1532
01:10:36,048 --> 01:10:37,816
YOU JERK.

1533
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,916
LOOK, I CAME HERE--...

1534
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:46,926
...   I KNOW. I CAN'T HELP IT.

1535
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:48,460
IT'S COOL.

1536
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,562
I KIND OF LIKE IT.

1537
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:50,963
REALLY?

1538
01:10:51,063 --> 01:10:53,848
YEAH, IT'S...KIND OF HOT.

1539
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:05,292
YES.

1540
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,807
WHAT A CIVILIAN.

1541
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:25,479
WHAT IS HE DOING?

1542
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:30,970
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

1543
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:33,875
THE STUPID SON OF A BITCH
IS HERE.

1544
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,008
HE'S POINTING AT SOMETHING.

1545
01:11:36,108 --> 01:11:37,376
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING?

1546
01:11:37,476 --> 01:11:39,476
NOTHING THAT I CAN SEE.

1547
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:52,658
STINKS DOWN HERE.

1548
01:11:52,758 --> 01:11:54,660
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?

1549
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,463
HE'S SNEAKING UP ON SOMETHING.

1550
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,732
IS THE CAMERA ROLLING?

1551
01:11:59,832 --> 01:12:01,832
OF COURSE.

1552
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,957
GOTCHA.

1553
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:25,557
JESUS CHRIST.

1554
01:12:25,657 --> 01:12:27,657
WHAT?.

1555
01:12:27,693 --> 01:12:28,894
WHAT THE HELL IS IT?.

1556
01:12:28,994 --> 01:12:30,763
SOME SORT OF--
SOME SORT OF CREATURE.

1557
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:32,398
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.

1558
01:12:32,498 --> 01:12:34,566
IT JUST VANISHED.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN VANISHED?.

1559
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:35,934
I MEAN, I HAD IT IN FRAME,

1560
01:12:36,034 --> 01:12:37,936
THERE WAS THIS WEIRD FLASH
AND IT VANISHED.

1561
01:12:38,036 --> 01:12:39,438
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A CLOAK.

1562
01:12:39,538 --> 01:12:41,538
LET ME SEE THAT.

1563
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,959
SEE IT?

1564
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:53,886
YOU PRESSED OFF
INSTEAD OF ON.

1565
01:12:53,986 --> 01:12:55,854
GOD DAMN IT.

1566
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:57,089
WE'VE GOT 40 MINUTES.

1567
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:59,491
OF BILL FUCKING FISHING.

1568
01:12:59,591 --> 01:13:01,994
AND NO EVIDENCE.

1569
01:13:02,094 --> 01:13:04,094
YOU ASSHOLE.

1570
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:19,212
STREAMS ALL LEAD
TO CIVILIZATION.

1571
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,900
WHY CAN'T I FIND
CIVILIZATION?

1572
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,392
I GOT YOU. I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

1573
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,494
COME ON.

1574
01:13:35,594 --> 01:13:37,594
COME ON. I GOT IT.

1575
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:46,186
I GOT IT.

1576
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:49,074
I GOT IT.

1577
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:51,469
WHOA, SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

1578
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,847
I'M GOING TO CHECK IT OUT.

1579
01:13:54,947 --> 01:13:56,682
OH, PLEASE DON'T, FUZZY BEAR.
RELAX.

1580
01:13:56,782 --> 01:13:58,984
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN DOING
FOR THE PAST TWO HOURS?

1581
01:13:59,084 --> 01:14:01,053
HAVING CRAZY SEX,
SUGAR PLUM.

1582
01:14:01,153 --> 01:14:03,153
SO WE HAVE AN ALIBI.

1583
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,665
HEY, ART. YOU KNOW.
I WOULD STILL...

1584
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:15,534
...    LOVE TO DRIVE
THAT NEW CAR OF YOURS.

1585
01:14:15,634 --> 01:14:17,669
MR. JOBS, SO NICE
OF YOU TO SHOW UP.

1586
01:14:17,769 --> 01:14:19,037
YOU.

1587
01:14:19,137 --> 01:14:20,939
BILL'S HAD ANOTHER
BIGFOOT SIGHTING.

1588
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:23,175
I WAS SURE YOU AND YOUR LITTLE
BUDDY WERE FUCKING WITH ME.

1589
01:14:23,275 --> 01:14:26,145
IN THE NEWS, EVERY TIME
THERE WAS A SIGHTING,

1590
01:14:26,245 --> 01:14:28,947
BUT HAIRY MAN,
IS FUCKING REAL.

1591
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,949
THAT'S WHAT
I TOLD YOU, MAN.

1592
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,918
HE JUST SCARED
THE SHIT OUT OF ME,

1593
01:14:33,018 --> 01:14:34,086
AND THERE'S NO FUCKING WAY...

1594
01:14:34,186 --> 01:14:36,622
... THAT WAS A PUNK-ASS KID
IN A SUIT.

1595
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,959
WHO ARE THOSE
TWO WANKERS.

1596
01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:38,575
OVER THERE?

1597
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:40,675
CLAIM TO BE FBI.

1598
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:43,462
HUH, WELL, COOL.

1599
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,130
GOOD LUCK, BILL.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

1600
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:47,466
PEOPLE. HEY.

1601
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:49,168
I GOT A PICTURE OF
HAIRY MAN.

1602
01:14:49,268 --> 01:14:53,138
HEY, HEY, I GOT A
PICTURE OF MY HAIRY MAN.

1603
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:55,607
I'M A REAL GODDAMN
WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHER.

1604
01:14:55,707 --> 01:14:57,707
LET ME SEE IT.

1605
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:02,796
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

1606
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,216
OH, MY GOD, FBI?

1607
01:15:04,316 --> 01:15:05,818
SHIT.

1608
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,986
THINK WE'RE IN TROUBLE?
OH, I KNOW WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

1609
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:09,154
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH.

1610
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:11,254
WE GOT TO FIND DAVID.

1611
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,960
OH, HOLD ON, IT MUST HAVE
JUST RUN OUT OF BATTERIES.

1612
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,763
OH, WAIT. NO, SHIT.

1613
01:15:17,863 --> 01:15:19,631
OH, SHIT,
THAT WAS MY LAST ONE.

1614
01:15:19,731 --> 01:15:22,568
GOD DAMN IT.

1615
01:15:22,668 --> 01:15:25,737
WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE PANTS?
THOSE ARE AWESOME.

1616
01:15:25,837 --> 01:15:28,474
I COULD REALLY DO SOME HIDING
IN THE WILD WITH THOSE.

1617
01:15:28,574 --> 01:15:30,574
WHAT SIZE ARE YOU?

1618
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,652
HI, LOUISE.

1619
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:42,752
HI.

1620
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,657
HEY, GRANDMA,
DAVID AROUND?

1621
01:15:45,757 --> 01:15:48,927
HIM AND AMY ARE UPSTAIRS
MAKING NOISE.

1622
01:15:49,027 --> 01:15:51,078
OH, REALLY?

1623
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:55,016
OUT OF BED, ASSHOLE.

1624
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,656
HEY, GUYS. WHAT'S UP?

1625
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:06,889
ARE YOU UP THERE
BANGING MY GIRLFRIEND?

1626
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:10,582
COME ON OUT, AMY.

1627
01:16:10,682 --> 01:16:12,017
WE HOOKED UP, TOO.

1628
01:16:12,117 --> 01:16:13,852
NICE.

1629
01:16:13,952 --> 01:16:17,947
BUT SERIOUSLY, GET DRESSED,
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

1630
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,067
WHAT'S UP?

1631
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:32,604
YOU GUYS CUT IT WAY
TOO CLOSE THIS TIME.

1632
01:16:32,704 --> 01:16:33,906
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1633
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,707
WE JUST LEFT THE LANDING.

1634
01:16:35,807 --> 01:16:37,910
AND THE SAME GUY THAT
WE SCARED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

1635
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,077
WAS LYING ON HIS BACK.

1636
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:40,746
RAMBLING ABOUT
HAIRY MAN TO ART.

1637
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,015
RING A BELL?
WHAT?

1638
01:16:43,115 --> 01:16:44,182
YEAH, THE TWO FBI GUYS...

1639
01:16:44,282 --> 01:16:46,218
... AND CHARLIE WERE THERE
AS WELL.

1640
01:16:46,318 --> 01:16:49,021
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1641
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:51,223
YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY
PULLED A SCAM WITHOUT US.

1642
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:53,325
AND YOU GOT WAY
TOO CLOSE THIS TIME.

1643
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:56,261
WE'VE BEEN INSIDE
FOR AT LEAST...

1644
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:58,361
...     TWO HOURS.

1645
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:00,566
SHIT, YOU DON'T THINK...

1646
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:03,035
...   I THINK THEY SAW
OUR LITTLE FRIEND FOR REAL.

1647
01:17:03,135 --> 01:17:05,260
WE GOT TO GO
CHECK ON HER.

1648
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,608
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1649
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,810
WE'RE GOING TO HER DEN
TO MAKE SURE SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

1650
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:14,346
SHE'S LEAVING TONIGHT.
IT'S THE FULL MOON.

1651
01:17:14,446 --> 01:17:15,881
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

1652
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:18,050
THEY ALWAYS LEAVE
ON THE FULL MOON.

1653
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:19,651
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

1654
01:17:19,751 --> 01:17:22,386
SHE'S SCARED,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1655
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,770
WHERE THE FUCK
ARE YOU GOING?.

1656
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:29,127
TO HER DEN, GRANDMA.

1657
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:30,862
SHE'S NOT THERE.

1658
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:32,164
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

1659
01:17:32,264 --> 01:17:33,665
SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

1660
01:17:33,765 --> 01:17:36,635
SHIT, WOULD I BE SITTING
HERE FOR NOTHING?

1661
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,003
I'M JUST SITTING HERE
TRYING TO CHILL...

1662
01:17:38,103 --> 01:17:40,483
...      WITH HER, YOU KNOW?

1663
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,204
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE FISH?

1664
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,949
SHE'S HUNGRY.

1665
01:17:51,049 --> 01:17:54,969
YEP, I THINK SHE'S
A STRESS EATER.

1666
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,171
OH, COMPANY.

1667
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:02,694
NICE CAR, ART.

1668
01:18:02,794 --> 01:18:04,794
NOT NOW, RODNEY.

1669
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,747
NEED ANY HELP?

1670
01:18:07,799 --> 01:18:10,009
NO, THANKS.
JUST A RACCOON.

1671
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,839
SOUNDS LIKE A BIG ONE.

1672
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:17,209
IF YOU ALL ARE THINKING ABOUT
GETTING INTO ANY MORE TROUBLE,

1673
01:18:17,309 --> 01:18:18,677
I WOULDN'T.

1674
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:20,012
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1675
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,013
HEY, ART?

1676
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,113
OH, NOTHING REALLY.

1677
01:18:23,181 --> 01:18:25,417
IT'S JUST THAT I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW...

1678
01:18:25,517 --> 01:18:27,252
...THERE'S A LOT OF FEDS AROUND...

1679
01:18:27,352 --> 01:18:29,354
... ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOU FOUR.

1680
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:30,756
HEY, ART.

1681
01:18:30,856 --> 01:18:33,158
HUH, THAT'S WEIRD.
I WONDER WHY?

1682
01:18:33,258 --> 01:18:36,428
THE ARMY AND THOSE TWO FBI GUYS
ARE ASKING FOR YOU.

1683
01:18:36,528 --> 01:18:38,096
YEAH, I WONDER WHY.

1684
01:18:38,196 --> 01:18:40,699
LOOKS LIKE
THE CAVALRY'S HERE.

1685
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,168
THEY'RE STAGING SOMETHING
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL.

1686
01:18:43,268 --> 01:18:45,737
I GOT TO GO OVER AND MAKE SURE
EVERYBODY BEHAVES.

1687
01:18:45,837 --> 01:18:47,172
HEY, ART,
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

1688
01:18:47,272 --> 01:18:49,272
BE GOOD.

1689
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:57,182
DRIVE SAFE.

1690
01:18:57,282 --> 01:18:58,717
SHIT, WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA DO?

1691
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,018
WE'VE GOT HAIRY GIRL
UNDER THE PORCH.

1692
01:19:00,118 --> 01:19:01,920
AND COPS EVERYWHERE.

1693
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:04,022
SHE HAS TO LEAVE TONIGHT.

1694
01:19:04,122 --> 01:19:05,190
WHERE DOES SHE NEED TO BE?

1695
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:07,159
AT HER CAMPSITE.

1696
01:19:07,259 --> 01:19:09,928
WHAT? SO, WE HAVE THE COPS.

1697
01:19:10,028 --> 01:19:12,831
THE FEDS.
AND APPARENTLY THE ARMY.

1698
01:19:12,931 --> 01:19:14,433
BETWEEN US
AND WHERE SHE NEEDS TO GO.

1699
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:16,168
GREAT.

1700
01:19:16,268 --> 01:19:17,836
WE NEED A DIVERSION.

1701
01:19:17,936 --> 01:19:19,371
WHAT WE NEED IS NOT TO DRAW...

1702
01:19:19,471 --> 01:19:21,139
...   ANY MORE ATTENTION
TO OURSELVES.

1703
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:22,474
NO, IF WE GIVE THEM
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR,

1704
01:19:22,574 --> 01:19:24,476
THEY WON'T STUMBLE ON
HER BY MISTAKE.

1705
01:19:24,576 --> 01:19:26,011
WE'LL PUT ON
THE FAKE UFO LANDING...

1706
01:19:26,111 --> 01:19:28,013
...        LIKE RODNEY
AND I PLANNED.

1707
01:19:28,113 --> 01:19:31,316
SO, YOU WANNA LURE THEM
TO A HOAX ON TRIBAL LAND?

1708
01:19:31,416 --> 01:19:33,819
WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE
THEM BIGFOOT AS WELL, RODNEY.

1709
01:19:33,919 --> 01:19:36,121
THIS ISN'T A BUNCH
OF FUCKING TOURISTS ANYMORE.

1710
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:38,256
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO GO BACK TO JAIL.

1711
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:39,825
OR GET SHOT.
YEAH.

1712
01:19:39,925 --> 01:19:41,827
OKAY, FINE.
I WILL WEAR THE SUIT.

1713
01:19:41,927 --> 01:19:44,029
DAMN, YOU GUYS
ARE SUCH WUSSES.

1714
01:19:44,129 --> 01:19:45,330
I WEAR THE SUIT
AROUND HERE.

1715
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:46,898
I WILL DO IT.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

1716
01:19:46,998 --> 01:19:48,166
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

1717
01:19:48,266 --> 01:19:49,735
LURING THE FEDS
AND THE ARMY CAVALRY...

1718
01:19:49,835 --> 01:19:51,403
...   TO TRIBAL GROUND
IS NOT AN OPTION.

1719
01:19:51,503 --> 01:19:54,873
LAST TIME IT HAPPENED
AROUND HERE, IT ENDED BADLY.

1720
01:19:54,973 --> 01:19:57,476
RODNEY, GET DRESSED
AND RUN AROUND TOWN.

1721
01:19:57,576 --> 01:19:59,177
THE REST OF US WILL SEND UP
THE LIGHTS AND BALLOONS...

1722
01:19:59,277 --> 01:20:01,113
...      AS SOON AS YOU CAN
HIDE AND TEXT US.

1723
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,656
THEY'LL SEE OUR UFO.
AND THEY'LL ALL COME UP.

1724
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:03,266
TO THE CLEARING.

1725
01:20:03,366 --> 01:20:04,483
I'M TELLING YOU NO.

1726
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:06,384
RELAX, CHIEF.

1727
01:20:06,484 --> 01:20:08,386
I'M AN ARMY BRAT, SO THE WORST
THEY'LL DO IS CALL MY FATHER...

1728
01:20:08,486 --> 01:20:10,322
...     AND THE JOINT CHIEFS
OR SOMETHING.

1729
01:20:10,422 --> 01:20:12,090
EVERYBODY ELSE CAN HIDE.

1730
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:13,759
WHAT?

1731
01:20:13,859 --> 01:20:15,026
YOU'RE FUCKING OUT OF LINE.

1732
01:20:15,126 --> 01:20:16,962
AND THIS NEVER
SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

1733
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,230
EXCUSE ME?

1734
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:20,265
I HAD THIS NICE
LITTLE SCAM GOING ON...

1735
01:20:20,365 --> 01:20:22,067
...   UNTIL YOU TOURISTS
GOT INVOLVED...

1736
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:23,068
...AND BLEW THE WHOLE THING UP...

1737
01:20:23,168 --> 01:20:24,302
... WITH YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEOS...

1738
01:20:24,402 --> 01:20:26,071
...AND YOUR BIGFOOT BABY CRAP.

1739
01:20:26,171 --> 01:20:27,906
SO THIS IS MY FAULT?

1740
01:20:28,006 --> 01:20:30,006
MOSTLY YOURS AND JEN'S.

1741
01:20:30,041 --> 01:20:30,976
OH, HOLD ON,
I DIDN'T WANT...

1742
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,778
...    SHUT THE HELL UP, JEN.

1743
01:20:32,878 --> 01:20:34,513
RELAX, OKAY?
JUST RELAX.

1744
01:20:34,613 --> 01:20:36,448
IT'S AN ACCIDENT.
ALL OF US ARE IN ON IT.

1745
01:20:36,548 --> 01:20:37,983
WE JUST HAVE TO FIX IT,
IT'S FINE.

1746
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,484
RODNEY, FUCK YOU, TOO.

1747
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,219
YOU'RE JUST AS MUCH
OF A TOURIST AS THEY ARE.

1748
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:43,555
BRO, REMEMBER
WHEN I LIVE 5 MINUTES.

1749
01:20:43,655 --> 01:20:44,731
DOWN THE ROAD FROM YOU
AND I'VE SEEN YOU.

1750
01:20:44,831 --> 01:20:45,241
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

1751
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,992
SINCE WE WERE 6 YEARS OLD.
YOU'RE SCARING HER.

1752
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,360
YOU'VE BEEN SQUATTING
ON TRIBAL LAND...

1753
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,061
...  LONGER THAN THEY HAVE.
SO WHAT?.

1754
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:51,897
SQUATTING?
ENOUGH.

1755
01:20:51,997 --> 01:20:53,832
OKAY, I'M SORRY
YOU DON'T LIKE IT,

1756
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,367
BUT I AM STICKING
TO THE PLAN.

1757
01:20:55,467 --> 01:20:56,835
NOW, YOU AND LOUISE
CAN GET HER HOME...

1758
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,537
...      AS SOON AS YOU HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY.

1759
01:20:58,637 --> 01:21:02,547
NICE TO HAVE MET YOU, LOUISE,
TAKE CARE OF HER.

1760
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:09,062
UNBELIEVABLE.

1761
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,084
HUH.

1762
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:34,072
WHAT, GRANDMA?

1763
01:21:34,172 --> 01:21:37,925
MUST BE THE RODEO CLOWN
IN YOU.

1764
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,420
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS GET THEIR ATTENTION.

1765
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,338
AS SOON AS THEY ARE FOLLOWING
YOU, JUMP IN THE BUSHES.

1766
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:50,807
AND TEXT US.

1767
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:52,858
WE'LL SEND UP THE BALLOONS
AND THEN YOU CAN DITCH THE SUIT.

1768
01:21:52,958 --> 01:21:54,259
ALL RIGHT.

1769
01:21:54,359 --> 01:21:56,561
JEN WILL MEET YOU LATER
AT HOME LATER, OKAY?

1770
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:58,063
YOU GOT IT?
GOT IT.

1771
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:01,099
HEY.

1772
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,199
BE CAREFUL.

1773
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:10,056
GO GET 'EM, BABY.

1774
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:16,915
YOU KNOW YOU WERE A JERK.

1775
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,351
THANKS, GRANDMA.

1776
01:22:19,451 --> 01:22:22,654
YOU REALLY NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

1777
01:22:22,754 --> 01:22:24,122
I NEED TO APOLOGIZE?

1778
01:22:24,222 --> 01:22:25,156
UH-HUH.

1779
01:22:25,256 --> 01:22:27,025
SHE CALLED ME CHIEF.

1780
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:30,629
WHICH IS A TITLE OF RESPECT.

1781
01:22:30,729 --> 01:22:33,498
SHE SHOULD HAVE
CALLED YOU TONTO.

1782
01:22:33,598 --> 01:22:35,950
IT MEANS STUPID.

1783
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:49,563
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH OUR PLAN, OFFICER?

1784
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:53,051
WHERE SHOULD I BEGIN?

1785
01:22:53,151 --> 01:22:54,486
THIS IS STANDARD
FEDERAL RESPONSE...

1786
01:22:54,586 --> 01:22:56,955
...  TO A THREAT TO
HOMELAND SECURITY, SO...

1787
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,957
...      I'VE READ THE BOOK.

1788
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:01,459
JUST THINK THAT
IT'S OVERKILL...

1789
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:02,961
...          FOR A BEAR
SIGHTING.

1790
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,496
OVERKILL?

1791
01:23:04,596 --> 01:23:06,331
YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT CREATURE.

1792
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:09,935
I ASSURE YOU THIS
IS NOT OVERKILL.

1793
01:23:10,035 --> 01:23:12,144
FINE, JUST MAKE
SURE YOU WRITE.

1794
01:23:12,244 --> 01:23:13,256
IN YOUR REPORT...

1795
01:23:13,356 --> 01:23:15,040
...      THAT I TOLD YOU IT
WOULD BE A MISTAKE...

1796
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:17,242
...        TO CALL IN
THE MILITARY...

1797
01:23:17,342 --> 01:23:18,977
...        OVER A
BEAR SIGHTING.

1798
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,313
IT WAS NOT A BEAR.

1799
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:24,215
AGENT WESSON,
IT'S ALWAYS A BEAR.

1800
01:23:24,315 --> 01:23:25,517
ARE YOU
FUCKING BLIND?

1801
01:23:25,617 --> 01:23:27,085
THERE IT IS.

1802
01:23:27,185 --> 01:23:28,186
THAT'S NOT A BEAR.

1803
01:23:28,286 --> 01:23:29,421
LET'S GO.

1804
01:23:29,521 --> 01:23:32,206
NOPE, JUST A DUMB-ASS.

1805
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,431
I CAN NOT BELIEVE
I SCREWED THIS UP SO MUCH.

1806
01:23:39,531 --> 01:23:41,366
DAVID SCREWED UP.
YOU TRIED TO APOLOGIZE.

1807
01:23:41,466 --> 01:23:43,134
NO, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT DAVID.

1808
01:23:43,234 --> 01:23:45,003
OKAY, THEN WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1809
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:47,103
HAIRY GIRL.

1810
01:23:47,138 --> 01:23:48,102
THEY'VE BEEN COMING
HERE FOR WHO KNOWS.

1811
01:23:48,202 --> 01:23:48,391
HOW LONG.

1812
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:51,076
WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS
UNTIL WE SCREWED IT UP.

1813
01:23:51,176 --> 01:23:53,511
WE'LL FIX IT.
I HOPE SO.

1814
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,736
DAVID'S STILL AN ASSHOLE.

1815
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,351
OKAY. TEN THOUSAND
FREAKING DOLLARS...

1816
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:00,552
...    AND YOU COULDN'T FIND
ONE PERSON TO HELP US.

1817
01:24:00,652 --> 01:24:02,652
SHH.

1818
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:06,191
HEY, ART, WE JUST
GOT A REPORT OF...

1819
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:09,260
...   A HIGH-SPEED CHASE
AND BIGFOOT RUNNING DOWN MAIN.

1820
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,495
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

1821
01:24:10,595 --> 01:24:12,397
HAIRY MAN'S JUST A DUMB-ASS KID.

1822
01:24:12,497 --> 01:24:14,733
NOTHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT.

1823
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:17,435
DON'T LET THEM AROUND.

1824
01:24:17,535 --> 01:24:18,470
DON'T LET THEM AROUND,
DON'T LET--COME ON, MIKE.

1825
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:21,306
OH, FUCK.

1826
01:24:21,406 --> 01:24:23,406
ASSHOLE.

1827
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,057
HE'S GETTING AWAY.

1828
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:43,237
HE'S NOT GETTING AWAY.
WE'RE RIGHT FUCKING THERE.

1829
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,663
GOD DAMN IT.
COME ON.

1830
01:24:45,763 --> 01:24:49,503
SORRY. I NEVER COULD FIGURE
THESE THINGS OUT.

1831
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,212
CAN YOU GET HER TO
HER DEN BY YOURSELF?

1832
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:02,380
YES.

1833
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,415
I GOTTA GO HELP.

1834
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:04,616
I KNOW.

1835
01:25:04,716 --> 01:25:06,051
I KNOW. GO.

1836
01:25:06,151 --> 01:25:07,118
I LOVE YOU, GRANDMA.

1837
01:25:07,218 --> 01:25:08,286
MM-HMM.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

1838
01:25:08,386 --> 01:25:09,788
BE CAREFUL.

1839
01:25:09,888 --> 01:25:11,623
HERE, YOU TAKE THE WHEEL.

1840
01:25:11,723 --> 01:25:13,158
NO, JUST TAKE THE WHEEL.

1841
01:25:13,258 --> 01:25:16,061
WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1842
01:25:16,161 --> 01:25:17,095
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1843
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:18,229
I'M GONNA GET HIM.

1844
01:25:18,329 --> 01:25:20,624
DO YOU SEE HIM?
WHERE IS HE?

1845
01:25:27,423 --> 01:25:29,423
WHAT? SERIOUSLY?

1846
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:32,477
HE'S STRAIGHT AHEAD,
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

1847
01:25:32,577 --> 01:25:34,379
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1848
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:37,369
PUT THE GUN DOWN.
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

1849
01:25:38,701 --> 01:25:40,701
SHIT, SHIT, SHIT. NO.

1850
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:45,256
HEY, DWAYNE.
HERE YOU GO.

1851
01:25:45,356 --> 01:25:47,459
HEY, RC, THANKS.

1852
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:48,660
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1853
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:50,428
WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND HERE TONIGHT?

1854
01:25:50,528 --> 01:25:53,098
BIGFOOT AND A HIGH-SPEED
CHASE DOWN MAIN.

1855
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:55,100
IT'S DAVID AND RODNEY AGAIN.

1856
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,568
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
THEY'RE UP TO BUT...

1857
01:25:56,668 --> 01:25:58,269
...    ONE OF THEIR
GIRLFRIENDS CALLED BEN.

1858
01:25:58,369 --> 01:26:00,371
NEEDS A CRANE RENTAL TONIGHT.

1859
01:26:00,471 --> 01:26:02,674
IT'S AFTER 10:00.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

1860
01:26:02,774 --> 01:26:03,797
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
THEY'RE UP TO, BUT THEY'RE.

1861
01:26:03,897 --> 01:26:04,226
PUTTING SOMETHING...

1862
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,244
... TOGETHER UP BY THE MEETING
GROUNDS.

1863
01:26:06,344 --> 01:26:09,214
IT'S LIKE ONE BIG DAMN PARTY
AROUND HERE TONIGHT.

1864
01:26:09,314 --> 01:26:11,398
YEAH, IT IS, ISN'T IT?

1865
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:16,154
HEY, SHERYL. YEAH, IT'S RC.

1866
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:19,357
THERE'S A BIG PARTY GOING ON UP
AT THE MEETING GROUNDS.

1867
01:26:19,457 --> 01:26:21,493
NO, NO. CALL THE GALS,

1868
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,262
GET A BUNCH OF BEER
AND HEAD ON UP.

1869
01:26:24,362 --> 01:26:26,598
NO, I PROMISE, IT'S GOING
TO BE A HUGE SHIT SHOW.

1870
01:26:26,698 --> 01:26:29,200
ALL RIGHT, HAVE A GOOD TIME.

1871
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,301
ALL RIGHT, MAN. I'LL CALL YOU
FROM THE ROAD...

1872
01:26:30,401 --> 01:26:32,655
...   AND LET YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

1873
01:26:32,755 --> 01:26:35,730
COME ON, RODNEY,
WHAT'S THE HOLD-UP?

1874
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,244
I DON'T KNOW ANY
OF THOSE PEOPLE.

1875
01:26:39,344 --> 01:26:40,311
I DON'T KNOW, EITHER.

1876
01:26:40,411 --> 01:26:42,280
HUH? ANYTHING YET?
NO.

1877
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,615
YOU GOT BARS?
FOUR.

1878
01:26:43,715 --> 01:26:45,283
WE SHOULD HAVE HEARD
FROM HIM BY NOW.

1879
01:26:45,383 --> 01:26:47,383
COME ON, RODNEY.

1880
01:26:50,806 --> 01:26:52,323
I'M JUST GOING TO WING HIM.

1881
01:26:52,423 --> 01:26:55,228
THERE'S ONLY ONE--
DON'T WING HIM.

1882
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,265
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT RODNEY.

1883
01:27:00,365 --> 01:27:02,200
HE'LL BE FINE.

1884
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,503
OH, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
TEN GRAND WILL GET YOU.

1885
01:27:05,603 --> 01:27:07,338
WHERE'S RODNEY?

1886
01:27:07,438 --> 01:27:08,740
YOU DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM?

1887
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,840
NO, NOTHING.

1888
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,622
OH, MY GOD.
HE'S GOING TO.

1889
01:27:13,722 --> 01:27:14,497
GET KILLED.

1890
01:27:14,597 --> 01:27:15,869
NO, AS LONG AS WE
KEEP HEARING GUNSHOTS.

1891
01:27:15,969 --> 01:27:16,365
HE'S NOT DEAD.

1892
01:27:16,465 --> 01:27:18,483
WE HAVE TO GO DOWN
THERE AND FIND HIM.

1893
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:20,327
IF RODNEY DIES.
I'M GOING TO BEAT.

1894
01:27:20,427 --> 01:27:21,570
THE CRAP OUT OF YOU.

1895
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,354
OKAY, THAT'S COOL.

1896
01:27:23,454 --> 01:27:25,623
I GOT THIS.

1897
01:27:25,723 --> 01:27:27,458
HEY, ART.

1898
01:27:27,558 --> 01:27:30,361
BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR
COUNTY FIRE AND RESCUE...

1899
01:27:30,461 --> 01:27:31,462
...   JOINING THE PURSUIT.

1900
01:27:31,562 --> 01:27:34,648
LET'S JUST KEEP IT SLOW, BOYS.

1901
01:27:37,353 --> 01:27:39,353
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1902
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:56,221
COME ON. LET'S GO.

1903
01:27:56,321 --> 01:27:58,321
COME ON.

1904
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:05,930
HEY, THERE, DWAYNE, ART
MANAGED TO GET THEM.

1905
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:07,599
OUT OF DOWNTOWN
AND SLOWED DOWN...

1906
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,334
...  ENOUGH TO LOSE RODNEY.

1907
01:28:09,434 --> 01:28:11,869
OH, THAT'S GOOD.
I HATE TO SEE HIM BACK IN JAIL.

1908
01:28:11,969 --> 01:28:14,606
HEY, UH, WHERE SHOULD
WE SEND THEM NOW?

1909
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:16,874
UH, OH, HOW ABOUT ACROSS
THE RIVER ON OLD STAGE ROAD?

1910
01:28:16,974 --> 01:28:19,010
OH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

1911
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:21,312
ATTENTION ALL UNITS.
BIGFOOT SIGHTED...

1912
01:28:21,412 --> 01:28:24,217
...MOVING EAST ON OLD STAGE ROAD.

1913
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:28,419
I'M SORRY.
I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.

1914
01:28:28,519 --> 01:28:30,771
WAY OUT OF THE LINE.

1915
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,630
OH, MY GOD.
I KILLED RODNEY.

1916
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,565
WHAT THE HELL, GUYS.

1917
01:28:40,665 --> 01:28:43,417
RODNEY.

1918
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,017
UGH.

1919
01:28:59,117 --> 01:29:00,385
WE'RE SO HOOPED.

1920
01:29:00,485 --> 01:29:02,787
THEY'RE ONLY
CHECKING IN TOWN.

1921
01:29:02,887 --> 01:29:04,055
THAT CHOPPER'S GONNA
FIND YOUR GRANDMA.

1922
01:29:04,155 --> 01:29:06,155
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

1923
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:09,761
DROP ME OFF AT
THE EDGE OF TOWN AGAIN.

1924
01:29:09,861 --> 01:29:11,029
AND I'LL LEAD THEM UP
TO THE CLEARING.

1925
01:29:11,129 --> 01:29:12,430
THE HELL YOU ARE.

1926
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:14,732
YOU JUST GOT
DESTROYED BY A CAR.

1927
01:29:14,832 --> 01:29:16,501
JEN, YOU NEED TO
TAKE HIM TO THE ER.

1928
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,601
GET DOWN. GET DOWN.

1929
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,006
WELL, I FOR ONE AM
NOT GOING TO LEAVE.

1930
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:24,826
AMY AND GRANDMA
HANGING, ALL RIGHT?

1931
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:26,077
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

1932
01:29:26,177 --> 01:29:27,078
GIVE ME THE SUIT.

1933
01:29:27,178 --> 01:29:29,681
WHAT?

1934
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:32,083
GIVE ME THE SUIT.

1935
01:29:32,183 --> 01:29:33,951
COME ON.

1936
01:29:34,051 --> 01:29:37,738
COME ON,
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

1937
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:45,663
ATTENTION ALL UNITS,

1938
01:29:45,763 --> 01:29:48,823
BIGFOOT HEADING SOUTH
ON MAIN STREET.

1939
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:54,709
WE'RE COMING TO
GET YOU, HAIRY MAN.

1940
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,745
JESUS, YOU'RE GONNA
HURT SOMEBODY.

1941
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:24,817
COME ON.

1942
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:28,539
UFO LANDING IN PROGRESS...

1943
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:29,807
...  AT THE MEETING GROUNDS.

1944
01:30:29,907 --> 01:30:31,676
I HATE TOURISTS.

1945
01:30:31,776 --> 01:30:33,544
HEY, LOOK.

1946
01:30:33,644 --> 01:30:34,746
NIGHT VISION.

1947
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:36,914
NICE.
YEAH.

1948
01:30:37,014 --> 01:30:38,049
WHERE IS HE NOW?

1949
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:39,851
I DON'T KNOW,
I THINK I LOST HIM.

1950
01:30:39,951 --> 01:30:41,071
I JUST SEE HIM.
HE'S STRAIGHT AHEAD.

1951
01:30:41,171 --> 01:30:41,670
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

1952
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:42,820
OKAY. HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.

1953
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:46,858
OKAY. OKAY,
WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHY.

1954
01:30:46,958 --> 01:30:48,092
DEAD LIFE PHOTOGRAPHY...

1955
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,594
...      AS SOON AS I HIT
THE MOTHERFUCKER.

1956
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,095
DON'T HIT HIM.
CAN I PUT MY FOOT HERE?

1957
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:53,097
HOLD STILL, HOLD STILL,
HOLD STILL.

1958
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:54,732
GOD DAMN IT.

1959
01:30:54,832 --> 01:30:56,832
GET DOWN. SHIT.

1960
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:08,646
BIGFOOT NOW HEADING
WEST ON OLD STAGE ROAD.

1961
01:31:08,746 --> 01:31:10,581
THIS IS DANGEROUS.

1962
01:31:10,681 --> 01:31:11,801
YOU ARE COMPLETELY
SAFE WITH ME DRIVING.

1963
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:12,668
DO YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?

1964
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,986
THESE FEDS ARE TRYING
TO GET AROUND YOU.

1965
01:31:15,086 --> 01:31:17,088
AND YOU BETTER NOT LET THEM
AROUND BECAUSE IF THEY GET--.

1966
01:31:17,188 --> 01:31:18,756
THEY GET THERE FIRST,
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN 'E.T.?'.

1967
01:31:18,856 --> 01:31:20,525
THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE
HAIRY MAN A LOBOTOMY.

1968
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:22,693
THEY'LL GIVE HIM A LOBOTOMY.

1969
01:31:22,793 --> 01:31:24,807
THIS IS ARMY AIR CAV
ONE, ALL UNITS STAND.

1970
01:31:24,907 --> 01:31:25,814
DOWN IMMEDIATELY.

1971
01:31:25,914 --> 01:31:29,000
WE ARE INBOUND
AND TAKING OVER SITUATION.

1972
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,225
NOBODY NEEDS TO GET HURT.

1973
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:35,940
THERE HE IS.

1974
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,191
WE GOT THE BASTARD NOW.

1975
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:42,038
HAIRY MAN
IS UP SHIT CREAK.

1976
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:52,790
ACT THREE, FINALE.

1977
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:55,960
THE FBI KILLS BIGFOOT. ACTION.

1978
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:58,060
WHAT?

1979
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:02,066
GET ON THE GROUND.
I'M NOT BIGFOOT.

1980
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:03,067
GET DOWN.
I'M NOT BIGFOOT.

1981
01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:04,168
DON'T SHOOT.

1982
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:06,268
GOD DAMN IT, DAVID.

1983
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:12,455
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHERE THE HELL.

1984
01:32:12,555 --> 01:32:14,555
IS THE CREATURE?.

1985
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,582
WHERE THE HELL
IS THE CREATURE?

1986
01:32:17,682 --> 01:32:18,983
I BELIEVE THIS IS MY
JURISDICTION.

1987
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:20,651
THIS IS A MATTER
OF NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE.

1988
01:32:20,751 --> 01:32:21,652
REALLY, A KID IN A
HALLOWEEN COSTUME?

1989
01:32:21,752 --> 01:32:22,753
HEY, I WANT THAT BACK.

1990
01:32:22,853 --> 01:32:23,955
COME ON, DAVID,
LET'S GO.

1991
01:32:24,055 --> 01:32:26,123
GENTLEMEN,
I'LL TAKE MISS CLARK.

1992
01:32:26,223 --> 01:32:27,658
I'M AFRAID NOT.

1993
01:32:27,758 --> 01:32:29,994
SHE'S GOT A LOT
TO ANSWER FOR.

1994
01:32:30,094 --> 01:32:33,130
BOYS, THIS IS WAY ABOVE
YOUR PAY GRADE. COME ON.

1995
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:36,283
SHE'S ALL YOURS.

1996
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,674
SORRY, ART.

1997
01:32:43,774 --> 01:32:45,176
HEY, DAD.
BIGFOOT'S BABY?

1998
01:32:45,276 --> 01:32:46,777
HEY.

1999
01:32:46,877 --> 01:32:49,881
YOUR MOTHER'S BEEN
WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU.

2000
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,531
WHERE THE HELL
IS THE CREATURE?

2001
01:32:53,635 --> 01:32:56,270
WHERE THE HELL IS THE CREATURE?

2002
01:32:57,773 --> 01:32:59,773
GOD DAMN IT.

2003
01:33:02,144 --> 01:33:04,144
YOU'RE WELCOME.

2004
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:10,701
THIS IS BULLSHIT.

2005
01:33:10,801 --> 01:33:12,801
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

2006
01:33:12,803 --> 01:33:14,803
I GOT PICTURES.

2007
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,662
I WISH THEY HADN'T
TAKEN MY CAMERA.

2008
01:33:54,695 --> 01:33:57,075
WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE PANTS?

2009
01:33:57,114 --> 01:33:58,616
THOSE ARE AWESOME.
I COULD REALLY DO SOME...

2010
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,151
...      HIDING
IN THE WILD WITH THOSE.

2011
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:01,886
WHAT SIZE ARE YOU?

2012
01:34:01,986 --> 01:34:02,920
SEE YOU, LOUISE.

2013
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:04,121
YEAH, SEE YOU, ARTHUR.

2014
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:07,674
OH, YOUR BADGE.

2015
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:21,687
ROCK ME, RODNEY.

2016
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:19,096
DO YOU MIND IF
I FISH THROUGH?

2017
01:35:19,196 --> 01:35:21,196
NO ONE'S STOPPING YA.

2018
01:35:33,027 --> 01:35:34,679
IT DOESN'T WORK.

2019
01:35:34,779 --> 01:35:35,680
WHAT?

2020
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:37,780
FISHING NAKED.

2021
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,316
YOU TOLD ME IT WAS
THE ONLY WAY TO.

2022
01:35:41,416 --> 01:35:42,304
CATCH BIG FISH?

2023
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:44,755
I LIED.

2024
01:35:44,855 --> 01:35:47,925
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF I COULD GET YOU NAKED.

2025
01:35:48,025 --> 01:35:50,025
GUESS IT WORKED.

00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,610
Hi, Daisy!

26
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,879
Hi, Sam.

27
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,548
Uh, you doing... stuff?

28
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,956
I was thinking of flying
over to the glow worm trail.

29
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,620
You want to go? Who, me?

30
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,687
Yes, I would... like to go...

31
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,562
to the trail... with you,
there, please?

32
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,234
Looks like someone
has a girlfriend.

33
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,364
I bet you they'll love
and care for each other.

34
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Oh, gross.

35
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,669
Oh, man, put some cork
in a twitch.

36
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,339
Ooh... smoochy, smoochy.

37
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,773
Max! Agh! Both of you!

38
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,820
Daisy, sorry, just ignore them.

39
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,684
Later then,
at the glow worm trail?

40
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,748
Sounds great, Sam.
I'll meet you there!

41
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,893
Fantastic! I'll...
I'll see you soon!

42
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,288
I can't believe you two!

43
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,858
That's pretty much the most
I've said to Daisy ever!

44
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,927
Now we're on a date.

45
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,701
Can't you two just leave me
alone for two minutes?

46
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,868
You're always just tagging
along beside me.

47
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,453
Hey, Sammy, wait up!

48
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,581
Agh, just leave me alone,
William.

49
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,784
I want to talk to you.

50
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,985
Forget it.

51
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,518
You might have been a little harsh
with Max and Twitch back there.

52
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,855
They started it.

53
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,527
They just can't leave me alone,
even for a minute.

54
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,036
They're your best friends, bro.

55
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,596
If they say stuff that you don't like,
you can't let it get under your wings.

56
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,304
Sometimes others don't understand
that when they joke around...

57
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,471
it can actually hurt feelings.

58
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,573
Look, just keep your chin up,
and always take the high flight.

59
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,708
Okay.

60
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,380
They're your friends, just treat
them how you want to be treated.

61
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,856
You! You vile giant!

62
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:33,957
You think you can come into our world,
destroy the natural beauty surrounding us?

63
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:38,095
No, sir! Not today!
Not on my watch!

64
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,970
Die, human scum!

65
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,107
No, please! Take the king, not...

66
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,648
Oh, sir... it's you.

67
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,711
Huh? What is it?

68
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,779
Your sons, my king...

69
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,882
they are late for their fitting.

70
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,854
Go! Get 'em!

71
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,555
Yes, sir!

72
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,464
Agh! I don't really want
to do this, but...

73
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,026
I can't be late again.
Dad'll kill me.

74
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,403
Sorry, Nature.

75
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,879
William! Sam!

76
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,417
Fly!

77
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,414
Sammy!

78
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,487
William!

79
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,516
William!

80
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,131
William? Sammy?

81
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,169
Sam, oh, am I glad to see you.

82
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,032
Your father would have
had my head if...

83
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,141
Will? Sam, you don't want to...

84
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,478
Will? Will, wake up.

85
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,546
Well, he's alive... but barely.

86
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,149
William needs
medical attention, now!

87
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,490
Take him to the infirmary!

88
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,862
Samuel... my son...

89
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,929
now is not a time for tears.

90
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:24,501
For eons, we Pixies
have been a proud community...

91
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,672
and so it has been
for generations...

92
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:33,015
whomsoever performs a misdeed against us,
suffers the fate of the Pixie Curse.

93
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:40,483
Samuel, my son, you shall bear the
brunt of our curse against this enemy.

94
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,589
Take that human back home and insure
that he lives a life of misfortune...

95
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:51,468
for all of eternity,
so say I, king of the Pixies!

96
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,145
Don't worry, we'll get him.

97
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,977
For sure... we'll get him.

98
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,517
We'll get him good.

99
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,817
Long day.

100
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,092
Ahh... honey, I'm home.

101
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,194
Hm, looks like it's just me
and you again, bed.

102
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,607
That guy can really sleep.

103
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,517
Talk about hittin' the snooze
button, huh?

104
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,145
Where's Sam?

105
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,656
Getting ice cream? You wish.

106
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,123
About time.

107
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,691
Hello to you, too.

108
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,896
Max, Twitch...

109
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,701
to insure victory in combat,
you must study your opponent.

110
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:04,210
Admire, respect their
attributes.

111
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,076
Now, let's drop a book
on his face.

112
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,180
Ow! Stupid shelf.

113
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,321
Oh!

114
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,968
Yow! Ow!

115
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,712
Oh, man, great work, guys...
seriously.

116
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,781
Oh, we've only just begun.

117
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,337
Ahh.

118
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,038
Yeah.

119
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,350
Hmm. Mm-mm?

120
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,620
Don't remember opening that
thing, hmm. Oh, well.

121
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,730
Agh! Oh, no!

122
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,737
Fire! Fire! Fire!

123
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,413
Hmm.

124
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,186
Agh!

125
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,687
You okay? Yeah, I'm good.

126
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,766
Oop, get that.

127
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,432
Huh?

128
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,340
Cat head. Did you say something?

129
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,370
Joe, you okay? I'm good.

130
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,943
Hmm.

131
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,078
Yeah, yeah!

132
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,019
Agh! My foot!

133
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:50,162
For the umpteenth time,
I'm not going out with you, Joe.

134
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,398
Aw, come on, Betty,
it'll be great!

135
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,940
We could play doctor.

136
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:58,000
No, my work and home lives
are separate, thank you.

137
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,978
But we already know
each other so well.

138
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,537
And that's why I have to turn
a charmer like you down.

139
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,375
Last thing I need to date
is a walking disaster.

140
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,147
Ouch.

141
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,551
You're a nice guy, Joe...

142
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,917
but you'll be a lot nicer when I don't
see you here three times a week.

143
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,325
That was colder
than your stethoscope.

144
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,021
Whoa! Whoa!

145
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,432
Go on, get out of here.
Scoot, scoot.

146
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,335
All right. Git!

147
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,304
Whoa, yeah, my bad.

148
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,070
Sorry.

149
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,584
Something's wrong, my luck
these days is just horrible.

150
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,827
Huh?

151
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,597
Huh?

152
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,015
Hello?

153
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,042
Joe, where the heck are you?

154
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,555
I'm on my way, sorry,
I had an accident.

155
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,989
Again with the accidents.

156
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,551
Ma'am, just bring your keys to Vincent over
there and he'll take good care of you.

157
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,530
Vincent? You put Vincent
in the shop?

158
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,123
What? He's good.

159
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,430
He doesn't know his alternator
from his elbow.

160
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,994
Maybe, but his elbow is on time.

161
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,975
You said you'd be done in an
hour. One hour, you said!

162
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,340
We'll miss the special!

163
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,606
How is she supposed
to get her blintzes?

164
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,080
I love the blintzes.

165
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,047
She loves the blintzes,
crazy about 'em!

166
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,054
All she has left
are these blintzes!

167
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,987
And now... no blintzes.

168
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,321
I don't know what to do
without blintzes.

169
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,361
She is lost without these
blintzes.

170
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,453
You're tearing her apart here,
I tell you!

171
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,521
Apart is what we're torn!

172
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,362
Something bad will happen.

173
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,028
She needs the blintzes!

174
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,572
Joe, just...
just get here quickly.

175
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,267
We need you at the desk.

176
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,175
Dad, I can work on the...
the cars, Dad!

177
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,610
I'm actually very competent.

178
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,079
It's not like every second of
my life is a complete disast...

179
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,683
Whoa.

180
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:19,975
You guys do that one?

181
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,987
That one was all
the wingless wonder.

182
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,494
Agh! Just one moment of peace!

183
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,557
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

184
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,499
I'm fine, just fine, I...

185
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,706
Are you sure? Because I hit you
pretty hard with that door.

186
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,011
Aw, that looks pretty bad.

187
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,274
Uh...

188
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,975
You know, I wasn't even
paying attention.

189
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,177
I was just fiddling around
with my phone thing.

190
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,382
Technological distraction, just more
industrial junk to distract us, right?

191
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,185
Ooh, kitty video!

192
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,330
Guy... hey! Snap out of it.

193
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,959
Come on, let's go
get you some ice.

194
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,143
Take a load off.

195
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,481
Oh, relax, I'll be right
back with that ice.

196
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,452
Welcome to the jungle, baby.

197
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,026
Oh, wow, she's so cute.

198
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,618
Maybe my luck has changed.

199
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:43,068
<i>JOE Um, I should
say something. Uh...</i>

200
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,036
You take all these?

201
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,369
Yup! Each and every one.

202
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,702
This is the Valdez spill?

203
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,734
Yeah, I took that one when
I was seven, just before my birthday.

204
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,643
Where's this?

205
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,111
Which one?

206
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,704
The kid on a pile of tech junk.

207
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,410
Oh, India...

208
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,749
You know most of our tech waste ends
up in a landfill in foreign countries?

209
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,015
Eh, didn't know.

210
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,684
Uh, I might be out of ice.

211
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,126
Hey, this tsunami one
is pretty intense.

212
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,719
Yeah, Sumatra...

213
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:13,396
I was having some freshly roasted
coffee with a few travel mates...

214
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,731
when, whoosh! It just hit!

215
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,769
I mean, lucky timing, I guess.

216
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,701
Hey, I can't find any ice,
but I got this.

217
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,501
Got what? Here.

218
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,601
Do you always attack
your guests with meat products?

219
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:28,477
Um, it's Tofurky,
so technically it's not meat.

220
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,311
And I don't have ice,
so this is gonna have to do.

221
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:34,251
Avegan with a throwing arm, I
didn't think that was possible.

222
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,618
Hey, if you have a problem with vegans,
you're gonna have two black eyes.

223
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,749
No, no, this is good.
I surrender.

224
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,430
Atta boy, we vegans aren't
all that bad, are we?

225
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,830
I guess not. Pictures
are a little heavy, though.

226
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,128
Negative effects of environmental abuse
was a good angle for my last art show.

227
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,639
I'm actually getting ready
for my next art show this week.

228
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,336
It's a diorama set of a 1950's amusement
park, and I've sculpted everything...

229
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,469
Hear anything?

230
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:03,482
I think I discovered a secret,
human language.

231
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,523
Hey, guys, check this out.

232
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,562
Looks like Joe might
have a girlfriend.

233
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,790
We'll see about that.

234
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,532
I'd like to hear
what they're saying.

235
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,572
You can see it on his face.
He's...

236
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,867
In love.

237
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,132
Isn't that how you
look at Daisy?

238
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,438
No! I don't!

239
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,503
You do! You <i>so</i> do.

240
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,277
Okay, dead wings for both
of you.

241
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,510
This sculpture is incredible.
You're very talented.

242
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,215
Well, thank you,
thank you very much.

243
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,850
World traveler, masterful
artist, Elvis impersonator...

244
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,292
and a looker to boot.

245
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,798
You probably'd say that to all the
people who physically assault you.

246
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,356
No, I'm serious.

247
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:02,738
Uh, hey, Dad, no, I...
I had another...

248
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,438
Yeah, yeah, I know, but I...

249
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,242
I'll be right there.

250
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,578
Hear anything?

251
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,813
I can't hear a thing
but my conscience crying.

252
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:14,910
What?

253
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,917
I mean, maybe we should
take a break.

254
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,921
And get lectured by your dad?
No, thanks!

255
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,254
I could go for some eats. There's
a Mexican skip around here.

256
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,595
It's supposed to be
<i>muy deliciosa!</i>

257
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,192
Is that on your Wing Watchers
approved diet?

258
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:35,173
No, but in the city, no one can
hear me eating burritos.

259
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,903
It's actually your silent ones
that are the problem.

260
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,673
You are so dead!

261
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,773
I'd rather take my dad's
lecture.

262
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,341
Listen, I'm running late
for work.

263
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,785
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry
to have kept you.

264
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,880
No, no, the pleasure
is all mine.

265
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,256
I, uh... I was wondering...

266
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,455
If I treat you to an apology
dinner for smashing your face?

267
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,828
Uh, yeah? Yeah.

268
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,196
Sure.

269
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,666
For real?

270
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,225
My name is Michelle.

271
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,296
Joe... nice to have my face
smashed by you.

272
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,603
Pleasure was all mine.

273
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,702
This is the part where
you ask for my number.

274
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,907
I'm... I'm not very good
at this, am I?

275
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,849
No, Joe, you're not.

276
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,453
Max, did you just power bomb
Twitch?

277
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:36,400
<i>Yo quiero nacho libre!</i>
<i>El Supremo Maximo!</i>

278
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,768
Oh, yeah!

279
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,502
Who da' man? You da' man.

280
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:49,537
Whoa, that's a lady.
You da' lady, man.

281
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,008
Sammy, our mark is leaving.

282
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:01,257
Guys! Come on! Let's give
it a rest for a bit.

283
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

284
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,399
Yeah.

285
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,679
She likes me!
She really likes m...

286
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,849
Hey, Dad, I'm
gonna be a little late.

287
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,419
You guys are impossible.

288
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,554
Hey! Today ruled!

289
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,964
Michelle's the greatest thing
I've ever seen.

290
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,770
Doo, doo, doo, dah, doo...

291
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,816
Hm?

292
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,721
Hm.

293
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,953
Stupid toothpaste lid.

294
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,600
Hrumph! Give me that!

295
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,631
All right,
so life's not perfect.

296
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,032
I did get to meet
the girl of my dreams.

297
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:26,435
Tomorrow, it will be better.

298
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,736
Wish tomorrow could be better
for me, too, big guy.

299
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,076
Sammy, what's the matter?

300
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,174
I'm not feeling it.
This isn't fun.

301
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,850
You're avenging your brother.

302
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,752
The fun part is just... fun.

303
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:44,815
Sam!

304
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:49,055
Let him go! He has to figure
this out by himself.

305
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,510
How's he doing?

306
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,551
He's doing much better, Samuel.

307
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,204
Sam? Sam!

308
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,506
I haven't seen you in forever.

309
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:40,739
How are you?

310
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,905
I'm great.

311
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,643
You look... stunning.

312
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,049
Why thank you, fair prince.

313
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,721
I've missed... well,
I've missed being here.

314
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,218
I've missed you, too.

315
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,923
Sam, you've just missed
the craziest thing.

316
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,727
It was insane!

317
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,927
Pixie Tom, you know,
the slug farmer?

318
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,232
Was flipping his lid!

319
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:10,071
I opened up the gate,
and it's like, Slug-apalooza!

320
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,700
You've gotta see this.

321
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,746
No, Twitch...
I don't gotta see that.

322
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,146
I want to mingle
with my Pixies for once.

323
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,743
Oh... oh...

324
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,947
Um... hey, Daisy!

325
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,649
Hi, Twitch.

326
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,249
Nice to see you and Max
haven't changed.

327
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,260
I think that was an insult.

328
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,887
Ah, it's gotta be a compliment.

329
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,727
That was a compliment, right?

330
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,994
Not in your wildest dreams.

331
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,868
Hey, Sam, we never
got that date.

332
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,134
How about we zip
to the glow worm trail?

333
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,835
Without your buddies.

334
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,071
Sure, that's great.

335
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,680
Wait! What about the curse?

336
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,902
Hello?

337
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,741
Hello? Sir?

338
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,143
Are you here?

339
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,205
Distraction!

340
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:28,083
Well? Whoa? Whoo!

341
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,816
It's Samuel,
he's in the village.

342
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,654
He's... Not with the human?

343
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,125
Take me to him, at once!

344
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,856
That boy has a lesson to learn.

345
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,023
You've really surprised me.

346
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,862
I thought I'd never
see you again.

347
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,266
You can't keep the prodigal son
away from home forever.

348
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,237
So what's it like?

349
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,239
Being on the outside
all the time?

350
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,706
A lot less fun.

351
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,040
Humans live to work and there's
no one to really talk to.

352
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,111
No?

353
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,307
What about Bumble Dee
and Bumble Dumb?

354
00:26:56,381 --> 00:27:00,682
Well, they're dependable, but I think you
summed them up pretty well yourself.

355
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:04,348
Well, I don't see them
around. Do you?

356
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,914
I suppose not.

357
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,333
Ow! That's two.

358
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,097
Want to go for a third?

359
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,729
No... you slap too hard.

360
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,398
That's the point.

361
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:26,338
Yeah, well, how about
if I gave you a dead wing?

362
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,813
Oh! My funny bone!

363
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:34,944
I'm genuinely surprised, all that extra
you doesn't work like an air bag.

364
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,118
I think Sammy's in trouble.

365
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,332
Wow...

366
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,698
spoiling the moment... again.

367
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,067
Sam, your dad, he's...

368
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,161
Super mad...

369
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,798
likeveins-bursting-
from-his-head mad.

370
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:56,967
And he's...

371
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:01,002
Standing in the presence
of the disgrace I call my son.

372
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,378
Dad, I... Save it!

373
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:07,180
When I make a declaration,
I stand by my decree.

374
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:10,154
Here you are making
a fool of yourself...

375
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,951
and making a fool
of this family!

376
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,457
It's not like that, Dad.

377
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,889
Oh, no? Then please explain
to me what this is...

378
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,864
because what I see is a son
disobeying his father...

379
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:24,801
so he can trounce around
with some questionable girl.

380
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,098
Some, girl?

381
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,197
Don't you dare raise your voice
to me, young man!

382
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,071
All you care about is vengeance!

383
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,336
What about love, Dad?

384
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,846
Did you ever think that maybe it would
be nice if I fell in love? Did you?

385
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,905
Love?

386
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,042
You don't know a thing
about love.

387
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:44,317
Love is when you build a kingdom
with your bare hands...

388
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,085
to impress a woman.

389
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:53,325
You spend 110 years of your life
raising two heirs to the throne...

390
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,165
and when someone takes that all
away from you, you make them pay!

391
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,172
And too scared to exact that
revenge yourself, you send me.

392
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,208
Get out of my kingdom.

393
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,401
Dad...

394
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:08,379
Get out, leave!
And don't come back.

395
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,848
Dad?

396
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,346
Sammy?

397
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,148
I have to go.

398
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,052
Awkward.

399
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,531
Stupid curse, you want me
to ruin a guy's life?

400
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,964
Is that what you want? Fine.

401
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:03,911
What the...

402
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,961
How'd a squirrel get
in here? Those aren't nuts!

403
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:07,835
Wait, ow!

404
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,011
Ah, toast.

405
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,115
Good morning, Mr. Bluebird.

406
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,318
Your friend here had a little
success with the ladies.

407
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:32,054
Surprised? I know, so was I.

408
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,998
I think today is gonna
be a brand-new start for Joe.

409
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,058
Huh?

410
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,502
Agh! Hot!

411
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,199
It's hot!

412
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,409
Agh! Fire! Fire!

413
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,887
Stupid nature.

414
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,517
What a mess?

415
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,562
Why me?

416
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,027
Huh... hello?

417
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,262
Footprints?

418
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,966
Ah... ah...

419
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,541
Hey!

420
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,277
Wh... did you just talk?

421
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,052
You just talked.

422
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,147
You said, "Hey." I heard you!

423
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,454
What are you?

424
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:38,087
I'm not letting you out of there
until you tell me what you are.

425
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:41,155
Fine, I'm here to give you a memo
from the flies in your kitchen.

426
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,996
They're forming a union.

427
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,333
You can talk! How? What are you?

428
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,602
I'm a figment
of your imagination.

429
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,472
Now go see your psychiatrist.

430
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,535
Atalking bumble bee?
What a smart aleck.

431
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:57,548
Do I look like a bumble bee?
They're fuzzy.

432
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:01,052
Wish I had a stinger, though.
I'd sting you with my butt.

433
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,987
A few more hours in there and
you'll take me more seriously.

434
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,693
Okay, okay...

435
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,130
I'm a pixie, okay,
see the wings?

436
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,364
Huh... why are you
in my kitchen?

437
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:24,637
I'm... um, I'm fulfilling
an obligation to my people.

438
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,473
Obligation?

439
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,514
You have been cursed.

440
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,344
Yeah, tell me about it.

441
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,113
We cursed you.

442
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,676
Hm?

443
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:40,350
You dumped some garbage into the ravine
and my brother is still badly hurt.

444
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,623
You nearly killed me and
destroyed half our village.

445
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,596
You've been cursed ever since.

446
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,258
All this time, it's been you?

447
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,359
Every time I fell
or ran into stuff?

448
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,165
All the trips to the hospital?

449
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:56,367
All the embarrassing, humiliating
moments when... it was you?

450
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,603
Why? Why would you
do that to me?

451
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,440
I told you, when you...

452
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,447
Because I dumped garbage
into a river?

453
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:07,076
I know, I... look, it's just
the way we do things.

454
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,083
Wait, no!
You can't leave me here!

455
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,454
I'm not letting you screw
up my life anymore!

456
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,005
Ahh.

457
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,273
Hm.

458
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,680
Okay, this is gonna be okay.

459
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:51,423
Any minute now, Max and Twitch
will arrive to save me.

460
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:55,558
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

461
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,269
Yup, any minute now.

462
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,433
Hey, Dad, lookin' sharp.

463
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,570
Joe, we agreed you weren't
supposed to be in here.

464
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,479
Now get back to the desk
and answer the phones!

465
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,574
Check the ignition cables?

466
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,815
Yeah, I checked all the cables,
replaced the fuel pump, the starter.

467
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:18,832
Give her another start.

468
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,415
Try it again.

469
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,392
Joe, I'm warning you.

470
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,395
And... that should do it?

471
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,798
What's next, Pops?

472
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,603
Hee-yaw!

473
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,232
He shoots... he scores!

474
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:40,342
Hee-yaw! Hee-yaw!

475
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,212
Huh.

476
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,384
Whoa! Whoa...

477
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,115
I got it! I got it!

478
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,121
Diddah!

479
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,686
Hee-yaw...

480
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,322
Help.

481
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,795
Hey, Joe! Yeah?

482
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,201
That was pretty incredible
back there.

483
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,329
Yeah?

484
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,806
Yeah, remember that promotion
we were talking about?

485
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,139
Yeah. Well, let's do it.

486
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,610
How about floor manager?

487
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,671
Really? You even have
tomorrow off to celebrate.

488
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,648
Why don't you go
meet a nice girl?

489
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,077
Already one step ahead
of you, Dad.

490
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,347
Oh, so that's
what's got you goin'.

491
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,616
I'm working on it.

492
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,454
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

493
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,790
Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

494
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,420
Go, Little Goobers!

495
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,466
I swear by all that is holy...

496
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,626
if you don't get off my slug...

497
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,602
Agh!

498
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:42,299
This pitch fork is goin
g where the sun don't shine!

499
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,570
That was awesome!
Sammy would have loved that.

500
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,274
Hey, where is Sammy?

501
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:54,376
Sam? Yeah, uh, Sam.

502
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,784
Where are you?

503
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,191
I see him. Where?

504
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,695
Over there,
he's underneath that glass.

505
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,630
What the heck
is he doing in there?

506
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,189
Ssh!

507
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,826
I'm trying to figure it out.

508
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,605
Really? Do you have
to do that now?

509
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,802
What? Slug riding
always makes me hungry.

510
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,538
Is there anything that doesn't?

511
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:25,447
Diets... no, wait,
those make me super hungry.

512
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,418
Wake up! Sam!

513
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,955
He's not moving.

514
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,694
Whoa! Look who's all smiles
and happy time.

515
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,665
And he's here to share a little
of that happy time...

516
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,894
with the lady he's been
thinking about all day.

517
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,267
Referring to yourself
in the third person?

518
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,306
This has to be something major.

519
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,670
I'll give you one guess.

520
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,539
Who's got two thumbs, one eye
and a promotion at work?

521
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,703
Ooh, who?

522
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,714
This guy right here.

523
00:36:56,781 --> 00:37:00,411
Stop, Joe! Put me down,
I'm gonna hurl!

524
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,352
I just got promoted to the
manager of the car garage.

525
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:07,381
Nothing I'd rather do than take you
out for a nice, celebration dinner.

526
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,687
What do you say?

527
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,285
Ah, absolutely. Yes!

528
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,490
III pick you up at 7:00 sharp.

529
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:28,473
Do you think he's<i>... muerto?</i>

530
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,707
Don't say that.

531
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:34,444
Sam? Sammy? You alive in there?

532
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,350
Twitch... Max...

533
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,549
Oh, man, I had the worst dream.

534
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,456
No dream, I was caught!

535
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,086
Twitch, Max, thank goodness
you're here!

536
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,496
You guys gotta hide. Great.

537
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,506
Hey! Guess what?
I had the perfect day.

538
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:04,572
Not a single incident, all thanks
to this little, glass jail.

539
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,016
Little guy knocked himself out
trying to escape.

540
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,518
Tenacious.

541
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,623
That was mine!

542
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,529
Coast is clear.

543
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,332
Hoo-hoo-cah-choo!

544
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:27,838
He can see us, dummy!

545
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,840
Look, I almost got out
of here all on my own.

546
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,671
With the three of us
working together...

547
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,075
we should have no problem
knocking this thing over.

548
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,440
Okay, got it. Yo comprende.

549
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:42,920
Um, on the boring days, I've been reading
Joe's Spanish-English dictionary.

550
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,521
On the count of three, we push.

551
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,993
One, two, three!

552
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,464
Harder!

553
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:01,466
Everything hurts!

554
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,563
But we're almost there.

555
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,438
One more push.

556
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:13,050
Ah-comite-comite-cora!
Ah-comite-comite-cora!

557
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,710
Tay-nay-tay, tah-nah-tah...

558
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,983
Hooru-hooru, nah-nah-ti-ti-ti...

559
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,489
Wakka-fi-fi-fay.

560
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,583
Harooha-harooha...

561
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,503
He's waking up!

562
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,666
Oh... what time is it?

563
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:37,741
Hey, there's more!

564
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,837
Run, you fools!
Sam, use your wings!

565
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:44,006
Right... but it was just... it was
so much more dramatic this way.

566
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,879
Let's get out of here!

567
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,384
Stop!

568
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,614
I missed my date.

569
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,816
I missed my date with Michelle!

570
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,087
This is all your fault.

571
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,089
Get back here!

572
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,816
That was really close.

573
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:25,982
Look, guys, I'm... I'm sorry
about what I said before.

574
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,854
You were there for me.

575
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,894
You're my best friends.

576
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,520
I'm sorry... bring it in.

577
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,124
Oop, that's a little tight, Max.

578
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,870
You! Fly. Everybody fly!

579
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,776
Yo, 'Zilla!

580
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,722
Wow.

581
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:05,688
You!

582
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,731
I just want to be left alone!

583
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,238
I missed the perfect date
with the girl of my dreams...

584
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,134
because of you and your trap!

585
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,208
That was mine.

586
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:22,212
Yeah? That was your trick,
here's mine.

587
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,252
Stay away!

588
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,215
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

589
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,069
Oh, but it did.

590
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:51,165
Not only does this outsider
know we exist...

591
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:55,577
but he has destroyed everything
I've worked so hard to build.

592
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,945
Dad, I'm so sorry.

593
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,847
This is all my fault.

594
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,653
Agh!

595
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,023
<i>Hey, Joe, it's Michelle.</i>

596
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:19,662
<i>I'm really looking forward to tonight and
I will see you in about 20 minutes. Bye.</i>

597
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,536
<i>Hey, Joe, it's a little past</i>
<i>7:00 now...</i>

598
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,905
<i>and I was just wondering</i>
<i>if you were running late.</i>

599
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,204
<i>Call me back.</i>

600
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,543
<i>Joe, it's 7:20, and I hope</i>
<i>everything's okay...</i>

601
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,242
<i>considering how we met.</i>

602
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,876
<i>Look, buddy, it's 7:30</i>
<i>and you are still not here.</i>

603
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,319
<i>Seriously? Call me.</i>

604
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:41,320
<i>Listen, I'm not trying to sound</i>
<i>psycho here, but it's 7:45.</i>

605
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,083
<i>Where are you?</i>

606
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,028
<i>Joe Beck, you stood me up,</i>
<i>you're a jerk!</i>

607
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,032
What? Hey...

608
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,129
Michelle?

609
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,834
Yeah, what do you want?

610
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,968
I just wanted to apologize for...

611
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,774
Oh, for being a jerk face?

612
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,280
No! Yes... wait, listen...

613
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,079
I just ran into
a little car trouble.

614
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,949
Aren't you a mechanic?

615
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,147
<i>Yeah, but... look...</i>

616
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:16,785
I think you're great, and I'm hoping you're
sweet enough to give me another chance.

617
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,261
Okay, meet me at the
Horn of Plenty tomorrow at noon.

618
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,128
That's the vegan restaurant,
right?

619
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,360
This time I won't let you down,
I promise!

620
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,967
Yeah, you'd regret it.

621
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:32,242
This means war, you know?

622
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:36,110
Hey, Dad, maybe we just do what
he says and leave him alone?

623
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,307
Excuse me?

624
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,145
Uh, who do you think you are?

625
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,947
I am your son,
and so is William...

626
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:44,955
and he would never approve of
what we've done to this human.

627
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:49,050
Well, Samuel, tell me, what
would William have approved?

628
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:53,188
Would he have approved of you bringing
death and destruction upon our kind?

629
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,994
He would have talked to the
human, reasoned with him.

630
00:43:56,066 --> 00:44:02,996
Reason? You ask for a reason, your brother may
not see another sunrise and you need a reason.

631
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,237
We Pixies do not reason
with our enemies...

632
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,938
we are survivors,
we are fighters...

633
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:12,177
and we will exact revenge
and uphold our traditions.

634
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:15,048
We ruined that human's life.

635
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,146
It's our tradition that caused
this destruction.

636
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:23,251
No, no, it was a boy who refused
the commands of his king...

637
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,922
a son who ignored his father.

638
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,932
I am here to keep
all of us safe.

639
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,867
That is why I wear the crown.

640
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,801
You need to exact revenge!

641
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:38,775
We the Pixies
declare war on Joe!

642
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,243
I guess you're right,
I'll do it.

643
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,916
You made the right choice,
my son.

644
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,976
Pixies! Brothers! Sisters!

645
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,352
Prepare yourselves for war!

646
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:07,161
Mm-hm. Hmm.

647
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,377
Hey, thank you.

648
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,211
Sorry to keep you waiting,
I had car trouble.

649
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,274
I thought you didn't drive?
Gotcha.

650
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,944
Come on, let's go inside.

651
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,248
What's on your tie?

652
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,983
It's a Kathulu.

653
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,115
Gesundheit.

654
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,886
No, no, it's a Kathulu.

655
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:05,396
It's a cosmic entity that's a mix
of human, dragon and octopus.

656
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,454
Oh, that Kathulu.

657
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,261
Yeah, he's awesome, right?

658
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,392
Yeah.

659
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:17,035
Welcome to the Horn of Plenty...

660
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:22,102
where food is thy medicine
and medicine is thy food.

661
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,343
My name is Alex and I
will be your server.

662
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,385
Please look over our menu.

663
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,444
Well, there's a chipper,
young lad.

664
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:34,788
Oh, yeah, he looks thrilled
to be here.

665
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,850
Agh! Are you kidding me!

666
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,863
What? Oh, uh, the menu!

667
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,957
They have, uh, durian.

668
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,262
Oh, you like durian?

669
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:45,996
Sure, yeah, love it.

670
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,436
Uh, just like Mom used to make.

671
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,105
I've, uh... it's a ritual I have.

672
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,844
I use the menu
and I slam it shut.

673
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,546
Then I... I work it like
a butterfly...

674
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:06,351
and I get the aroma
of the kitchen in.

675
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:10,292
Mm.
Um, I've never heard of that.

676
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,885
Mm.

677
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:15,956
Oh, wow, you are so right.
I can totally smell the miso.

678
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,262
Look out!

679
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,042
A fig? Are you hungry, sir?

680
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,476
How about I bring you
some bread?

681
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,974
Are you... okay?

682
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:37,920
Yeah, I had a horrible
experience at Christmas once.

683
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:40,924
Figs were involved...
it didn't end well.

684
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:44,223
Ugh, tell me about it, the
holidays can be pretty traumatic.

685
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:48,595
This one time, my mom and I were decorating
our tree when my dad came in and, um...

686
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,070
Agh!

687
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:57,266
Your bread... and what
will you be having today?

688
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,936
Ooh, I'll have the organic
Portobello sandwich...

689
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,947
with a side of vegan soy
and tofu fries, please. Joe?

690
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,643
Uh, I'll have the same.
Does it come with bacon?

691
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,909
Meat is death.

692
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,249
Hold the bacon.

693
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,085
Everything all right, Joe?

694
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,556
Yup, yup, doing good.

695
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,185
Just keeping an eye out
for more figs.

696
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:22,030
Well, anyway, so we were
decorating our tree, when...

697
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:27,230
Oh, it's on! Let's do this!

698
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,431
What are you talking about?

699
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:33,341
Oh, it's on...
the animal shelter.

700
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,174
It's on, it's open.

701
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,510
Let's go to the animal shelter.

702
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,676
Oh, that is so incredible, yes,
let's go there right now.

703
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:44,479
Look, I'll cancel our order and we can
go to my parents' for dinner later.

704
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:48,992
This is getting out of control.
I said stay away!

705
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,690
Don't you just love the smell
of the animal shelter?

706
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,299
Oh, yeah. Love that smell
of... wet dog?

707
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:05,302
If I had it my way, humans would be
locked up and the animals would be free.

708
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,934
So you're a trouble maker.

709
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,536
What? No! I'm not
a trouble maker.

710
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,091
Ooh! Hold that pose!

711
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,328
Done!

712
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,033
You had that pair of scissors
there the entire time?

713
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,336
A good artist
is always prepared.

714
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,376
It made for a great sketch.
What the...

715
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,412
How do you... it's amazing!

716
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,118
What's amazing is that
you didn't get bit.

717
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:49,316
Speaking of biting, my parents are having
dinner at 5:00, if you're still hungry.

718
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,378
Uh, meeting the parents already.

719
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,720
I actually think my mom will
really like you.

720
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,350
My dad, on the other hand, he's
a bit harder to get to know.

721
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:57,985
Hold that thought.

722
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,757
Don't you dare! Joe, what?

723
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,058
What is it?

724
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,699
No, no, no, no! No! Agh!

725
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,744
Aw, Joe, that is so sweet.

726
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,245
I mean, you can't stand to see
that little puppy in here.

727
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,282
You're saving him
from these oppressors!

728
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,249
That was your plan
the entire time.

729
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:24,584
Uh... absolutely! Eh...

730
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:32,362
Hey, Joe, are you sure
you're cool with this?

731
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,728
I know it's a bit early to be
meeting my parents and all and...

732
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,529
Yeah, I'm looking forward
to it. Why?

733
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,537
Well, you just seem
a bit... distant.

734
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:46,339
Uh, I'm just picturing how wonderful your
parents must be if they raised a girl like you.

735
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,412
Let's just head inside, shall
we?

736
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,545
Namaste.

737
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,609
Thank you, I think I shall stay.

738
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,814
My word, he's so precious.

739
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:01,820
Gail, don't scare the boy before
I've had a chance to meet him.

740
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:06,393
Help me with the tofu,
it's getting unwieldy!

741
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,262
You did fantastic
with this one, Michelle.

742
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:12,359
Not like that last boy you brought
over, with the piercings...

743
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:15,133
and that loud carbon-emitting
death trap he was driving.

744
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,504
Gail! Coming!

745
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,372
I had to come from somewhere.

746
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,412
You didn't want
to warn me first?

747
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:28,383
All hail King Pixie!

748
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:36,292
For too long, we have been pushed
to the edges of this world.

749
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:40,592
We live in the ruins
of the temple that was nature.

750
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,156
The humans continue
to force us back...

751
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:47,136
with their growing gluttony
of technology and garbage.

752
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,838
But no more, my pixie warriors!

753
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:54,503
No more! Today, we make a stand!

754
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:59,846
Today we strike back at the very
core of indecency and woe...

755
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:04,286
that has beset our tribes
for generations.

756
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:09,691
Today we will strike down the
auto mechanic known as Joe.

757
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:16,528
For the glory of Pixies!

758
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,330
He's incredible!

759
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,495
I wish my mom was here
to see this.

760
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,334
Max, she's right over there.

761
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,169
Hey, Max!

762
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:25,903
Oh... hi, Mom!

763
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,613
Are you ready for war, Sam?
Uh... Sam?

764
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,705
I have a bad feeling about this.

765
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:38,280
And this is the kitchen,
the stone is from Argentina...

766
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:42,156
and most of the decor
hails from Africa.

767
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,194
Having trouble keeping up
with Mom?

768
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,627
Who me? I'm good.

769
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,563
Pretty sure the speed walking
wore holes in my shoes, though.

770
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,533
Oh, oh, a Canadian.

771
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,332
Hey, Joe, what do you call
a cow with no legs?

772
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,565
Oh, Dad, please don't.

773
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:56,937
What?

774
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,871
Ground beef!
Because the cow is on the...

775
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,311
I think the boy gets it, dear.

776
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:09,286
Okay, okay, it also wouldn't hurt to
have real beef every once in a while.

777
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,548
That's enough, Captain Cannibal.

778
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,783
Do I look like someone
who'd eat people?

779
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,758
I'd never eat a person...

780
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:19,387
unless you consider
the talking cow a person.

781
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:22,921
In which case, I might just be
persuaded to give it a try.

782
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,297
I think they like you.

783
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,700
As long as your dad doesn't
toss me on the grill.

784
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,304
Just grab a tray.

785
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,637
Cheap thing won't light.

786
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,374
So what's your deal, Joe?

787
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:41,282
Oh, I'm an auto mechanic.
I actually just got a promotion.

788
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:42,910
That's great!

789
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:46,980
You hear that, Gail? This hard-working
boy just got a promotion.

790
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:49,817
This is moving fast, isn't it?

791
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,920
Oh, so what? I met your father
on a Tuesday...

792
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,397
and a week later,
we were married in Vegas.

793
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,229
Well, I'm definitely
not ready for marriage.

794
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,294
He's cute, funny, seems like
he's got things together...

795
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:04,239
and it would be nice
to have grandkids around.

796
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:05,775
Okay, slow down, Mom!

797
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:09,677
I just can't get this
lighter going!

798
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,615
Here, let me try. Hm...

799
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,743
Hmm.

800
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,921
That's some bad luck, son.

801
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,551
Bad luck?

802
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,861
Oh, no!

803
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,528
Okay, girls! Joe's got
the hot stones going.

804
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,730
What happened to your eyebrows?

805
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,966
Uh, pyrotechnic mishap.

806
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,375
How in the world did a grease monkey
like you become such a charmer?

807
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,436
Just lucky, I guess.

808
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:47,314
Huh. Joe, not sure if you've
ever done hot stones before...

809
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:48,647
but dinner takes a while.

810
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,880
What we do to keep things
moving is play a game.

811
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,014
How about boys versus girls?

812
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:54,648
Mom!

813
00:54:54,724 --> 00:55:01,289
Your call, Joe, or are you afraid
of getting crushed by the girls?

814
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,334
Uh, sure, yeah, I'm in.

815
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,372
For William!

816
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,039
Get over...

817
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,843
Is the game Charades?

818
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:22,784
I don't think so.

819
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:25,048
Then what is he doing?

820
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,885
He... help.

821
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:28,515
Purna Shalabhasana!

822
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,617
What? Full locust.

823
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:32,526
Mom, what are you talking about?
Is he having a seizure?

824
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:36,464
No, I think he's stretching.
Looks like Ashtanga yoga.

825
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:41,728
There's the Shashankasana Pose.
Nice form, Joe.

826
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,972
Garudasana.

827
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,473
Ardha-Kurmasana.

828
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,409
Ardha Matsyendrasana.

829
00:55:55,085 --> 00:56:00,615
Dandayamana Biebhakta
Paschimottanasana!

830
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,457
Yeah, I don't know that one.

831
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:07,958
J... Joe, Joe...

832
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,695
Ow... oh, no!
My body shouldn't do this.

833
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,102
He is a very fit, young man.

834
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:23,413
And Shivassana to end,
what a display!

835
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,609
It's also known
as the dead body pose.

836
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,651
A little pre-meal stretch
is good for everyone.

837
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,121
Come on, Henry.
Come on, Michelle.

838
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,714
Gather round.

839
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,029
Our troops are exhausted, sir.

840
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,997
They need rest
and cannot continue.

841
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:46,503
They liked what he did?
They think he's fit?

842
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,505
We need him ruined!

843
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,804
Do something, Sam. You must be
the hand of vengeance.

844
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,037
Fine.

845
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:57,845
All right, team, let's eat!

846
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,754
This is not
one of my better days.

847
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:18,662
Well done, my son.

848
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:22,966
Let's go home.

849
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,008
What makes you think
this is over?

850
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,736
It's over for me.

851
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,837
What I just did... wasn't right.

852
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,514
I am so sorry, Mom.

853
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:37,815
Don't worry about it.

854
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,015
Everyone's okay
and that's what matters.

855
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,990
Besides I haven't seen an
explosion like that...

856
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,721
since I smuggled
antiquities out of Egypt.

857
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,956
Yeah. Love you, Mom.

858
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:50,523
Well, saves me some money
on a hair cut, at least.

859
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,035
No hard feelings, Joe.
Hope your luck changes.

860
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,970
Look, can I apologize for...

861
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,634
Not right now, just drive.

862
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,204
Hey, hey, Michelle, wait up!

863
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,478
Look, I would really appreciate
it if you just left.

864
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:13,478
Oh, man, this is gonna be great.

865
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:14,683
Michelle.

866
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,556
Joe, I'm working right now and
do not have the temperament.

867
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,220
Please, let me explain.

868
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:20,923
Explain what?

869
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:25,492
That you ruined my parents' house with
some outlandish yoga-infused craziness?

870
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:26,627
No, I...

871
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:29,673
Look, I have seen klutzy before and
I thought that was adorable...

872
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,231
but today's events,
that was too far.

873
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:33,936
What is wrong with you?

874
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,742
If I tell you, you promise
not to think I'm crazy?

875
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,612
Go ahead, I'm listening.

876
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,275
Pixies. Pixies?

877
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:45,579
Pixies... it's this whole
curse thing.

878
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:46,679
It started a while ago.

879
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:47,756
You think that's funny?

880
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:48,985
What? Hah!

881
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:52,756
You think you can win me over by
blaming Pixies for your problems?

882
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,957
No, it's the truth,
absolute truth!

883
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,727
Joe, just go home...

884
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,893
before you break something
I won't forgive you for.

885
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,934
There! Behind you!

886
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,704
Stop! I don't have the
patience for this any more.

887
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,075
I got it!

888
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,551
Please leave, Joe.

889
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,748
I...

890
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:23,054
I'm... I'm so sorry.

891
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:30,997
What next?

892
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,126
Sam?

893
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,863
We go home.

894
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,235
This is over.

895
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,603
Huh?

896
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,801
You're not thinking big enough,
Sammy boy.

897
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:46,315
Joe? You okay?

898
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,044
Joe!

899
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:56,690
About time... gimme a hand.

900
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,990
Perfect! Oh, no.

901
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,124
Ugh...

902
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,381
Oh, this is the best day
of my life.

903
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,697
Dad, this is really
going too far.

904
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:38,064
All is fair in war and love.

905
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,736
Dad... Son...

906
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:48,869
well-placed tree sap
can work wonders.

907
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,243
Dad, look at him.

908
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:54,648
All I see is a big load
of human scum.

909
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,034
Hello?

910
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:20,872
Joe, are you okay?

911
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:25,043
How could you possibly think
this is right, Dad?

912
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:29,051
Right or wrong,
we did what must be done.

913
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,020
Pixies, our war is over!

914
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:35,183
And history shall declare
us victorious.

915
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,286
I need a status update.

916
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:17,356
Sir, it looks like this is gonna
take a lot longer than we expected.

917
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,958
How long are we talking?

918
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,901
Well, if you factor in...

919
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:21,970
I said how long!

920
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,803
A few dozen years.

921
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,172
What are our options?

922
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,144
We could send half of our Pixies
to join another colony.

923
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,239
Send scouts to check for room
in allied villages.

924
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,784
Start dividing us up
into refugee camps.

925
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,843
Yes, sir, will do.

926
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:39,923
So much for our kingdom.

927
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,219
What are we gonna do?

928
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:45,886
I have an idea.

929
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:55,031
Oh, wow, you've really
let this place go...

930
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,436
and yourself.

931
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:59,032
Have you not moved at all?

932
01:03:00,881 --> 01:03:02,521
We're gonna need
to get you in the shower.

933
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:05,913
Why, so you can trip me again?
Set my room on fire?

934
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,109
Continue to ruin my life?

935
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,811
No, no, I never...

936
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,945
Look, I didn't want to do it.

937
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:14,320
This was all because of my brother,
and he would have hated this.

938
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,827
He always used to tell me to treat
people how you want to be treated.

939
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,955
Do onto others. Huh?

940
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:26,469
We humans have a saying, "Do onto
others as you want done onto you."

941
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,528
That sounds like my brother.

942
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:31,540
My mom used to say it.
It's why I gave up.

943
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,133
I deserved your punishment.

944
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,510
I think we deserved the same, after
ruining your life for so long.

945
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,241
So now what?

946
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,341
Now we're gonna stop this
horrible cycle...

947
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:44,546
and we're gonna do
something good... together.

948
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,987
I like the idea, but how?

949
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:49,082
First, you're gonna
have a shower...

950
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,286
and next, I'm gonna
burn that chair.

951
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,555
Good call.

952
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,160
It does feel good
to build something.

953
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:02,603
Pixies are not great builders.

954
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:05,000
Magnificent tricksters,
fantastic ruiners...

955
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:07,476
great smashers, but after
we break something,

956
01:04:07,502 --> 01:04:09,537
we never have to put
it back together.

957
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,048
We really suck
at building things.

958
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,016
Really? Birds build nests out of
sticks in like a day.

959
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:18,111
Birds eat us. Touché.

960
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:21,914
Let's keep the chatter down.

961
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,192
No one else can see me and
people are starting to stare.

962
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,163
Are you invisible?

963
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,534
No, we're wings and blood,
just like you, Joe.

964
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:35,970
Don't over think it, big guy.

965
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,439
Hey, believe me, most things
in life, I don't over think.

966
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:41,477
This time, though, I have
put some thought into this.

967
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:54,355
You're Samuel's friend Twitch,
aren't you?

968
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:57,518
This is where I get my medal
for brilliant combat strategy.

969
01:04:57,593 --> 01:05:00,062
Have you seen my son, Samuel?

970
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,893
What? No medal?

971
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:04,297
I, um... saw him.

972
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,393
Well, do you know
where he is now?

973
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,165
I think so.

974
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:13,301
Well, I'd like to, er... um...
apologize for my behavior.

975
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:16,505
He may have been a little wiser
than I gave him credit for.

976
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,481
We'll find him, sir!

977
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,517
Come on, Twitch.

978
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,679
Since when have you been
the leading type?

979
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,659
Hurry up, Chunky.

980
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:35,596
Listen, just because I might not
be what you call a small pixie...

981
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:38,032
doesn't mean you can pick on me.

982
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,695
I can't look like the Pixies
in those magazines.

983
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,563
I'm sorry, Max.

984
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,699
He's torturing Sammy.

985
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,536
It sounds like laughter to me.

986
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:52,104
Of course, it sounds
like laughter!

987
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,173
It's diabolical laughter!

988
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,687
Let him go, you mad man!
Let him go!

989
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,949
Let's go tell the king.

990
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:21,667
Oh, great majesty,
lord of all we survey...

991
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,542
he who is higher
than the holiest of...

992
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:26,138
Okay, okay, just get to it.

993
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:31,552
Your son, our friend, the prince Samuel, is
being tortured by that big-headed human.

994
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,714
What? Is this true?

995
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,759
It is true, his head is massive.

996
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:40,019
He's pulling Sam apart,
wing by wing!

997
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:43,157
You two, enough already,
round up the troops.

998
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:45,463
We have one last battle
to fight.

999
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:48,504
Ah, what's with all the fuss?

1000
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,335
Samuel! My boy!

1001
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,637
You're alive!

1002
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:55,007
Did that... that human hurt you?

1003
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:58,172
I've been working with Joe.

1004
01:06:58,247 --> 01:06:59,647
He wants to help us and...

1005
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,741
Help us? But he hates us...

1006
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:04,116
just as we hate him.

1007
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:08,317
Joe doesn't hate us, he was
angry, but we ruined his life.

1008
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:11,020
You were angry
because William was hurt.

1009
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:14,495
Both of us are allowed to be angry,
but what we did when we were angry...

1010
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:18,432
it was wrong, Dad,
we were both wrong.

1011
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:21,232
You have an entire kingdom to lead
and you're going to lose them.

1012
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:25,570
Let it go, Dad.
Let's stop the fighting.

1013
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:29,408
Forgive me, sir, you've been
so worried over William...

1014
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,606
you forgot about Sam.

1015
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,447
He's a great son,
and an amazing leader.

1016
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:36,747
Huh.

1017
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,687
I can help lead our people
in a new direction...

1018
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,553
but I need you to trust me.

1019
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:45,618
Look at you... Samuel, oh, oh...

1020
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:54,834
I am sorry, my son. I'm sorry.

1021
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,699
Follow me, Dad.

1022
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,139
I have a surprise to show you.

1023
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:02,269
I have a surprise for everyone!

1024
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:06,778
Everyone, this is Joe.

1025
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:09,182
PIXIES Hi, Joe!

1026
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,810
Hi.

1027
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:14,789
I... I'm really sorry about
what I did to your village.

1028
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,553
I lost my temper.

1029
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:21,723
What I did was wrong and
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1030
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:27,628
And William, I wish
I could take it all back.

1031
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,195
Sam told me something that
William used to tell him...

1032
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:33,174
something my own family
once said.

1033
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:35,677
Do onto others as you'd
have done onto you.

1034
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:39,408
I hope what I'm about to show you repays
just some of the damage I've caused you.

1035
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,451
Welcome to your new home.

1036
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:46,114
Each house has plumbing
and electricity.

1037
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:48,783
Sammy mentioned that sometimes the
elements can be harsh out there...

1038
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:50,850
and this thing is storm-proof.

1039
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:54,226
I can attach it easily to the
rest, assuming you want it...

1040
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,458
and we can both forgive
each other.

1041
01:08:56,532 --> 01:09:02,403
Joe, um, we forgive you,
and we are also sorry.

1042
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,635
I know this is what William
would have wanted.

1043
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,267
It is, Dad.

1044
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:08,834
William! My son!

1045
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,573
You're okay!

1046
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,775
Ooh, careful, guys, yeah,
still not quite healed yet.

1047
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:16,580
William, I'm so sorry!

1048
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,814
It was never my intention...

1049
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,448
I'm really glad you're okay.

1050
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:24,426
Pixies may be small,
but we're feisty.

1051
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:25,688
So, I've learned.

1052
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:29,664
Well, Joe, I've been wrong
all along.

1053
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:34,170
It seems we can co-exist...
and peacefully.

1054
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,932
Way to go, Dad!

1055
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:39,266
Dad, William, with everything
Joe's done for us...

1056
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,435
maybe there's something
we can do for him.

1057
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:47,481
Mrs. Mayor, you look
absolutely stunning.

1058
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,848
Just stunning!

1059
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,547
Deanna, you must give me
a call sometime next week.

1060
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,351
We need to talk TV interviews
for Michelle.

1061
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:58,451
You have my card? Get it off
the desk inside! Ciao!

1062
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:07,859
How's my brilliant artist doing,
on her big night?

1063
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,269
Terrible.

1064
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:12,308
Michelle, honey, I know
you've had setbacks...

1065
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,809
but we couldn't push this
opening off any longer.

1066
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,711
Use the ones you've repaired
and let's hit it!

1067
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,874
Barbara, they look terrible.

1068
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,282
I can't represent myself
like this.

1069
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:28,450
Michelle, my dear, you're established,
respected, published and never rejected.

1070
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:32,552
In the art world, that means
your mistakes are art.

1071
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,460
And everyone will love you
for it.

1072
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,294
Just say it's part
of the exhibit.

1073
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,960
You can say it represents
the broken world we live in.

1074
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,532
Are you sure?
I... oh, I don't know.

1075
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,904
I've been doing this
for a long time, honey.

1076
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:48,342
Now you've got 300 people who
don't give a rat about the truth.

1077
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,743
They just want to see some art.

1078
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:55,382
Ladies and gentlemen,
attention, please! Oh...

1079
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,682
Now, without any further
adieu...

1080
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:02,851
let me introduce the lady of the
evening, Miss Michelle Myers.

1081
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,894
Oh, thank you.

1082
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,952
Oh... oh my, thank you.

1083
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,624
That is just so nice,
thank you so much.

1084
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:13,658
Well, firstly, I wanted to start
by thanking all of you...

1085
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,432
as my manager Barbara
just did...

1086
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:20,374
for your understanding in regards
to this ever-changing opening day.

1087
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,604
This project has been
a long time coming...

1088
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:26,672
and just as I thought I'd reached
the end of this long journey...

1089
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:32,017
fate or circumstance caused some havoc in my
personal life that effected my work here.

1090
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:38,316
Um, I am missing some of the
little people for...

1091
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:39,862
Excuse me.

1092
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:42,796
Uh, hi, hello,
sorry to interrupt.

1093
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,494
Excuse me. Joe...

1094
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:49,561
Special delivery for a Michelle.
Where should I put it?

1095
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,539
Joe, if you so much as...

1096
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:52,870
Trust me.

1097
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:57,777
Um, ladies and gentlemen, it appears that
I do have another guest for my carnival.

1098
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:00,543
Looks like he arrived on-time,
after all.

1099
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,682
Trust me, please.

1100
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,089
Okay, you're all set.

1101
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,815
This is unbelievable!
This is going to go viral!

1102
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:39,787
No, better, this is going
to go antibiotic!

1103
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,949
I feel healthier
just watching it.

1104
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,356
Wow.

1105
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:45,985
And the delivery guy
was a great touch.

1106
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:48,895
So avent garde,
what showmanship!

1107
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:51,024
Oh, thank you.

1108
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,569
They look so real!

1109
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,934
You must have spent a fortune
on these little robots!

1110
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:09,811
This is...

1111
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,547
I can't believe it.

1112
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:14,488
I'm not looking for an apology, I
wouldn't have believed me, either.

1113
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:17,583
I just didn't want you to think
I was making fun of you.

1114
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:18,957
I'll never do that.

1115
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,019
And I couldn't show you they're
real, because...

1116
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,088
Because we don't exist.

1117
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,465
This is a one-time favor
we owed Joe, okay?

1118
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:28,163
Wh... yeah, I understand.

1119
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:31,636
It's a really long story.

1120
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,107
Are you still mad at me?

1121
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,078
Look at that.
He got the girl, after all.

1122
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,514
She is pretty cute...

1123
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,414
for a creature without wings.

1124
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:44,646
I don't see you with a girl.

1125
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,552
I don't see you with one,
either.

1126
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:50,684
Yeah, well, I've got you
to keep me company, right?

1127
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,421
Always.

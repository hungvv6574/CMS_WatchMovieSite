2
00:00:44,388 --> 00:00:48,147
- Are we on?
- Yup. Introduce yourself.

3
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:51,725
Okay. Hey, I'm Frank.
How're you doing?

4
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:54,437
Don't answer that.
That's rhetorical.

5
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:58,503
Okay, let's get
you up to speed.

6
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:03,287
This is a story
about the future.

7
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:07,400
And the future
can be scary.

8
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:11,533
What?

9
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:13,880
Are you sure you
want to go with scary?

10
00:01:13,905 --> 00:01:16,100
- Yes, I want to go with scary.
- Okay.

11
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,717
Okay.

12
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,939
The future can be scary.

13
00:01:21,964 --> 00:01:23,956
Unstable governments.

14
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,840
Overpopulation.

15
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:27,927
Wars on every continent.

16
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:29,234
Famine.

17
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:30,950
Water shortages.

18
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:32,301
Environmental collapse.

19
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,792
And scientific breakthroughs,
wonder and beauty..

20
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:37,539
Could you please just
stop interrupting?

21
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,652
I will. Just try to be
a little more upbeat.

22
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:40,934
- Upbeat?
- Yeah, tell them what you like.

23
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,535
I can't tell them anything
if you keep interrupting me.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,886
You're right.
Sorry.

25
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:46,632
As I was saying

26
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:49,108
With every second
that ticks by

27
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,985
- we get closer and closer...
-  Oh, I know. Tell them about...

28
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,667
I can't tell them anything
until I tell them about this.

29
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:57,880
Can we please just
start somewhere else?

30
00:01:57,905 --> 00:02:00,255
Fine. Where would you
like me to start?

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,565
Well, you keep saying the future
wasn't always this way, right?

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,722
It wasn't. When I was
a kid, the future was...

33
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:08,114
- Different. Right?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,316
Okay, cool.
Let's start there.

35
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:14,447
Alright. Well,
when I was a kid

36
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:17,621
The future was different.

37
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,679
Flushing Meadows,
Corona Park World Fair!

38
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:28,633
Don't forget your valuables
and enjoy the future.

39
00:03:14,772 --> 00:03:16,144
Hello, sir.

40
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,407
- May I help you?
- My name is John Francis Walker.

41
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,633
- I'm here to win $50.
- Is that so.

42
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,919
I took it apart because of
the nitrogen compartment.

43
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:30,730
Seeing as how the bus ride was
kinda bumpy, and, you know nitro.

44
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:34,412
I could have used a hydrogen
peroxide-powered engine,

45
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,509
while lapses of that
with their rocket belt,

46
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,139
and I guess there
were some issues

47
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:41,671
with maneuverability and
flight duration and stuff.

48
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:44,314
It's a jet pack.

49
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,297
Obviously.

50
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:48,533
You made
this yourself?

51
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:55,394
Athena, what
are you doing here?

52
00:03:57,465 --> 00:04:00,129
Did you?
Or didn't you?

53
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:02,132
Uh.
I...

54
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:05,836
What?
Did you make this yourself?

55
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:07,547
Yeah.

56
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:09,342
Why?

57
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:15,546
I guess I got tired of waiting around
for someone else to do it for me.

58
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:20,274
Does it work?

59
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:24,648
Um... Sure.
Yeah.

60
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:32,272
Mostly.

61
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:39,589
It just doesn't really,
you know, technically...

62
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:54,601
fly.

63
00:04:56,777 --> 00:04:59,272
But if it did, you
know, technically fly,

64
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:01,140
what would it's purpose be?

65
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:03,923
How would your jet pack
make the world a better place?

66
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:05,116
Can't it just be fun?

67
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:09,200
Mr. Walker, please tell me
you can do better than 'fun'.

68
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,542
Anything is possible.

69
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,088
I-I don't know
what that means.

70
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:17,386
If I was walking down the street and I saw
some kid with a jet pack fly over me,

71
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,407
I'd believe
anything's possible.

72
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:20,868
I'd be inspired.

73
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:23,431
Doesn't that make the
world a better place?

74
00:05:24,764 --> 00:05:26,685
I suppose
it would.

75
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:30,433
If, it worked.

76
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,677
Unfortunately,
it does not.

77
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,663
And if it doesn't work,
it has no purpose at all.

78
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:38,192
Thank you for your
time, Mr. Walker.

79
00:05:38,193 --> 00:05:40,360
But I can
make it work.

80
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:41,920
That's the spirit.

81
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:44,199
Until then,
young man...

82
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:46,640
have fun.

83
00:05:57,812 --> 00:06:00,215
Absolutely not.

84
00:06:00,338 --> 00:06:02,238
I like him.

85
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:04,796
Athena, no.

86
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:20,864
What makes you think you're
gonna make this thing fly?

87
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,113
- I'm optimistic.
- You're wasting your time.

88
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:24,800
- I'm not.
- Damn contraption.

89
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,708
It's not a contraption!

90
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:27,940
It doesn't work.

91
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:31,220
- I can make it work.
- No, you can't.

92
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:33,837
I'm not giving up.

93
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:39,601
Don't turn around.
Be cool.

94
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:41,175
What did I
just tell you?

95
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,913
- Sorry.
- Stop talking.

96
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:45,865
Look over there,
5 o'clock.

97
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:50,098
You know?
On a clock?

98
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:52,332
Where the 5 is?

99
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,058
That way.

100
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:02,393
I'm going with them. You
count to 20 then follow us.

101
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:05,025
Don't get spotted.

102
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:11,311
Who are you?

103
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:15,239
I'm the future,
Frank Walker.

104
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:50,186
Excuse me.

105
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,440
Sorry.

106
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:57,117
Whoa-whoa-whoa...
Sorry folks,

107
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,415
you're gonna have to
wait for the next boat.

108
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,645
There'll be another
boat in just a minute.

109
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:07,918
Hello?

110
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:10,769
Hello?

111
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:13,975
Hello?

112
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,721
Good afternoon. Please step
aboard the transport.

113
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,302
The site is active.

114
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:43,422
Please put on your
head protection,

115
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:46,940
in order to prevent
significant injury.

116
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:49,244
Injury?

117
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:59,072
Transport will commence
in 10 seconds.

118
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,290
Wait.

119
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,466
- Wait. Wait
- 5.

120
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:07,365
4.

121
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,527
3.

122
00:10:08,552 --> 00:10:10,150
2.

123
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:11,475
1.

124
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,310
Hey, that's mine.

125
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:32,301
Did you just fix it?

126
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:34,668
Wait.

127
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:45,783
Hey!

128
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:48,310
Hey!

129
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,717
Aww!

130
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,125
Whoa.

131
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,460
Wooo!

132
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,941
Hey.

133
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,537
It works now.

134
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:20,730
So.
What is this place?

135
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,385
And then,
everything went to hell.

136
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:35,127
- Oh, boy.
- Well it did.

137
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:38,372
So you gave them like, one second
of blue skies and jet packs and....

138
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:40,557
It's important they need
to know the stakes.

139
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:43,163
I think they can figure out
clocks counting down on them.

140
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:44,690
- Do you want to tell the story?
- No, you're gonna...

141
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:46,294
Because if you think
you can tell the story better

142
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,761
I would absolutely
love to hear you try.

143
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,692
- Wow, really?
- Really.

144
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:53,489
Well, I guess technically
I am more qualified.

145
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:56,583
Are you?
How so?

146
00:15:56,608 --> 00:16:00,211
Because unlike you,
I'm an optimist.

147
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:02,286
- Hey. Babe, you filming?
- It's video.

148
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,347
I knew it.

149
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:06,167
- You video it.
- Okay, go ahead, sweetie.

150
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:07,675
Do your thing, Casey.

151
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,685
That's Sirius.

152
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,782
That's Canopus.

153
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:13,707
That's Acturus.

154
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:15,232
Rigel Centaurus.

155
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:20,722
Vega, Procyon,
Capella, Betelgeuse.

156
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,837
Why do you love the
stars so much, Casey?

157
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:27,988
Because,
I wanna go there.

158
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:29,636
But it's so far away.

159
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:31,925
It will take a long time.
A real long time.

160
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,637
What if you get all the way
up there and there's nothing?

161
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:40,759
What if there's
everything.

162
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:42,158
- Oh, boy.
- What?

163
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:43,807
We're gonna go through
your entire childhood?

164
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:46,120
You started when you were a kid.
I'm just giving them context.

165
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:48,113
Just move it along, okay?
They don't have all day.

166
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:50,184
Cool.
You got it.

167
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:52,923
Identify yourself.

168
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:57,069
Nate, if you wake up dad,
I will crush you.

169
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:58,992
You shouldn't sneak out.

170
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:01,887
Well you shouldn't
still need a lovey.

171
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:04,114
Dad says it's
okay to sleep with.

172
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,676
That's because he doesn't
want you to grow up.

173
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,429
Were you at the
platform again?

174
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:12,228
What do you
do out there?

175
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:15,940
Are you trying to stop them?
From taking it down?

176
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,469
No.
That would make me a criminal

177
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:24,486
and a pretty terrible role model to
impressionable youth such as yourself.

178
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:28,307
But if someone
else did it

179
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,434
I've to assume,

180
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:32,651
they believed,

181
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:35,451
even the teeniest of actions

182
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:39,219
could change
the future.

183
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:41,769
How can
you be sure?

184
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:44,220
Because I know
how things work.

185
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:49,026
Why are they taking
the platform down?

186
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:54,412
Guess it's hard to have ideas,
and easy to give up.

187
00:20:55,052 --> 00:20:57,111
But you won't,

188
00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:58,651
right?

189
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,761
Never.

190
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:47,750
Hey, dad.
Heading to school.

191
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:50,661
- Made you lunch.
- Hey.

192
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,248
Wrap it up.

193
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:03,385
- How'd you do...
- You would've gotten it.

194
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,812
Yeah, Eddie Newton.

195
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:10,527
What?

196
00:22:10,804 --> 00:22:13,076
All three cranes.

197
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:14,492
Alright, Douglas.

198
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:16,522
Thanks for the call.
Bye.

199
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:17,741
Everything okay?

200
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:20,570
Yeah, the equipment over
at Canaveral's down again.

201
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:23,995
- Weird.
- Really weird.

202
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:25,891
Well at least you
get the day off.

203
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,158
Actually, their bringing in
replacement cranes from Orlando

204
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:31,189
so I will be back
to work by noon.

205
00:22:31,653 --> 00:22:33,692
- That's fantastic.
- Case.

206
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:35,032
Yeah?

207
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:37,947
Nothing's gonna stop 'em from
taking down that platform.

208
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:41,122
Nothing. And when we're done,
I'm out of a job.

209
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:43,540
There's nothing anyone
can do about it.

210
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:46,303
- It's inevitable.
- Well then, you'll find something else.

211
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:49,070
You're a NASA engineer.

212
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:51,905
With nothing to launch.

213
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:56,955
- There are two wolves.
- Case.

214
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,892
You've told me this story my
entire life and now I'm telling you.

215
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:05,078
There are two wolves,
and they're always fighting.

216
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,808
One,
is darkness and despair.

217
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,357
The other is
light and hope.

218
00:23:13,132 --> 00:23:16,226
Which wolf wins?

219
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:17,987
Come on, Case.

220
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:20,574
Okay. Fine.
Don't answer.

221
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:23,891
Whichever one
you feed.

222
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:27,266
Good.

223
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:31,901
Eat.
Come on.

224
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,372
Mutually assured destruction.

225
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,375
Today, any nuclear
country or terrorist

226
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,364
is capable of inflicting
damage on a massive scale.

227
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:46,902
- With weapons of...
- Environmental entropy.

228
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:51,707
The polar ice caps aren't waiting for
us to decide if climate change is real.

229
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:54,946
Rising coastal waters,
intensifying weather patterns

230
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:57,663
they're all punching,
our one way ticket to...

231
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:01,920
Dystopia, by definition,
not perfect.

232
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:03,956
Huxley's 'Brave new world'.

233
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,328
Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451'.

234
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:08,935
Orwell's '1984'.

235
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,129
Once considered fiction, these futuristic
novels are actually happening right now.

236
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:16,293
And they seem to be getting
worse. Yes, Miss Newton?

237
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:18,155
Can we fix it?

238
00:24:18,454 --> 00:24:19,351
Sorry?

239
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:23,971
I get things are bad, but
what are we doing to fix it?

240
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:29,192
Have a good
weekend, everybody.

241
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:10,267
Newton?

242
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,372
- Yeah.
- You made bail.

243
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:16,138
Motorcycle's in impound. You can pick
up your personal effects over there.

244
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:24,599
- Newton?
- Yeah.

245
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:38,160
Alright.
Okay.

246
00:25:38,185 --> 00:25:41,512
One money clip,
$47.32

247
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:44,228
One Florida state driver's license,
one baseball cap.

248
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:47,449
We got... one pin,
one pack of Beemans gum.

249
00:25:47,474 --> 00:25:48,792
And I don't know
what this is.

250
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:50,578
Sign here.

251
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:01,436
- That's not mine.
- What's not yours?

252
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:02,552
The pin.

253
00:26:02,553 --> 00:26:03,572
I've never...

254
00:26:03,597 --> 00:26:05,725
Aw!
What! What!

255
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,402
Huh!

256
00:26:22,672 --> 00:26:24,961
No way.

257
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:58,562
Have I been here
the whole time?

258
00:26:59,312 --> 00:27:00,932
I know.

259
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,284
No!

260
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:07,742
I got it.

261
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:21,475
You have no idea of the strings I had to pull to keep
Homeland Security from pressing charges, Casey.

262
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,672
This is not just vandalism, alright?

263
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:26,061
It's NASA.
It's government property.

264
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:28,012
Have you ever
seen this before?

265
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:29,449
You're not getting
it, are you?

266
00:27:29,474 --> 00:27:30,964
I'm very upset with you.

267
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:32,347
I get it.
You're angry, I understand.

268
00:27:32,372 --> 00:27:35,387
But I just need you to look at it.
Does it look weird?

269
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:36,794
Don't touch it!

270
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:38,153
Why are you
yelling at me?

271
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:40,563
Not while you're driving,
Dad. It's dangerous.

272
00:27:40,588 --> 00:27:42,576
Just pull over.

273
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:44,282
Pull over.

274
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:48,105
I swear to God, Case,
if you're on drugs...

275
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,248
I'm not on drugs.
Just, look.

276
00:27:52,281 --> 00:27:54,032
I need you to be
NASA dad now.

277
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:57,088
New frontier dad, okay?

278
00:28:00,484 --> 00:28:05,161
All will be explained, as
soon as you touch this pin.

279
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:19,892
What, it's...

280
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,353
It's not working?

281
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,987
You're not seeing this!

282
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:32,752
Stop it!

283
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:38,598
Honestly, Casey. I don't
know what's gotten into you.

284
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:36,892
- Come on, guys.
- Bad move, Dexter.

285
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,889
Totally sweat.

286
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:43,301
Come on, idiots.

287
00:31:43,326 --> 00:31:45,468
We're gonna be late for R&D.

288
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:42,396
The hover rail will be
arriving in 1 minute.

289
00:33:04,178 --> 00:33:05,825
Are you coming?

290
00:33:05,912 --> 00:33:09,548
- You can see me?
- We don't have all day.

291
00:33:10,932 --> 00:33:15,413
- Wait for us!
- North bound line. Now departing.

292
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:20,462
Next stop: Space port.

293
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:18,229
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

294
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:19,755
Do you promise you'll
transmit everyday?

295
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,999
- Even when you're out of range.
- Come on, what's the big deal.

296
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:25,633
We're only going
twenty light years out.

297
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:28,715
Now arriving: space port.

298
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:16,413
- Hey guys, over here.
- Oh, hey.

299
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:50,770
Come on. We saved
a seat, just for you.

300
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:02,623
Now you run
out of power?

301
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:05,886
Aww.

302
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:07,212
- Nate, wake up.
- I didn't do it!

303
00:36:07,237 --> 00:36:09,961
Dad changed the password to
his computer. Do you know it?

304
00:36:10,688 --> 00:36:12,273
You smell like swamp.

305
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:14,176
Tell me the password and
you can go back to sleep.

306
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,190
Your phone has internet.

307
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,294
My phone got soaked
in a lagoon.

308
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:20,876
Fine.

309
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:24,355
What are we
looking for?

310
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,170
Stop!
That's it.

311
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:35,205
Extremely rare collectible pin
commemorating the 1964 World's Fair.

312
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:40,374
Experts and purveyors of the most extensive
selection of space-age collectibles in The World.

313
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,887
Whoa. This site
is like ancient.

314
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:45,019
Okay, give me their number.

315
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:47,145
They don't have a number.

316
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,767
They don't
have a number?

317
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,556
They have an address.

318
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:54,269
Okay, look. You are gonna tell Dad,
you woke up, saw me leaving...

319
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:57,782
I told you I was going camping
with friends and I will call tomorrow.

320
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:01,512
- Can you do that for me?
- Only if you tell me what's going on.

321
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:04,877
I...
I...

322
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:08,760
I think that I saw...

323
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:12,290
That I went to...

324
00:37:12,852 --> 00:37:14,788
the future.

325
00:37:17,505 --> 00:37:19,474
Can I come, too?

326
00:37:20,348 --> 00:37:22,982
Not...
 yet.

327
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:49,663
- Huh!
- Hello. Is Casey Newton home?

328
00:37:49,688 --> 00:37:51,261
Uh.
No.

329
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:54,572
She ordered some cookies
and I'm delivering them.

330
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:56,007
You're a girl scout?

331
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:57,412
Of course, I am.

332
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:59,010
Why aren't you
wearing a uniform?

333
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:00,708
It's at the cleaners.

334
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:02,663
Those are Oreos.

335
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:07,247
Could you please tell me
when Casey will be back?

336
00:38:07,272 --> 00:38:10,993
She went camping with some friends.
She's gonna be gone for a couple of days.

337
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:13,605
Is that what you
told your parents?

338
00:38:14,645 --> 00:38:16,368
Um...
Yeah.

339
00:38:16,393 --> 00:38:17,532
But it's not true.

340
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:19,063
Yeah, it is.

341
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,433
No, Nathan.
It's not.

342
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,249
Don't ask me how I
knew your name.

343
00:38:23,274 --> 00:38:27,493
I know it the same way
I know that you're lying to me.

344
00:38:28,112 --> 00:38:30,372
Are you from the future?

345
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:32,527
You clearly understand.

346
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:36,129
So why aren't you telling
me what I need to know?

347
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:38,229
That pin thing,

348
00:38:38,254 --> 00:38:41,759
 it stopped working.
She went to find another one.

349
00:38:41,784 --> 00:38:44,966
Nathan, where
is she looking?

350
00:39:13,258 --> 00:39:14,732
Hello?

351
00:39:14,757 --> 00:39:15,898
Sale this week.

352
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:18,667
Front 3 shelves,
70% off.

353
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:21,477
Oh. No thanks, I'm not
here to buy anything.

354
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:26,059
I was hoping that you
could tell me about this.

355
00:39:29,885 --> 00:39:31,714
Hugo!

356
00:39:32,424 --> 00:39:33,937
Hugo!

357
00:39:36,992 --> 00:39:40,806
Welcome,
to Blast from the Past...

358
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:44,504
Thank you for
the help, dear.

359
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:46,175
Well. If you'd just kept it open
you wouldn't need my help.

360
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,242
If I kept it open it would ruin the
effect which is everything.

361
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:51,004
Pardon my wife, she has no respect
for showmanship. Hugo Gernsback.

362
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:53,917
- How may I help you?
- She has a pin.

363
00:39:54,398 --> 00:39:56,407
She has a pin.

364
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,005
I saw that you were
looking for one online...

365
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,713
Where did you get it?

366
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:00,964
What can you
tell me about it?

367
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:03,646
I can't tell you anything about it unless
you tell me who gave it to you.

368
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:05,899
I'm not going first.

369
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:08,885
Well it seems our
business here is done.

370
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:11,585
Seems it is.

371
00:40:17,478 --> 00:40:19,726
Saw something,
didn't you.

372
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,542
When you touched it.

373
00:40:25,252 --> 00:40:27,872
Something incredible?

374
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:31,541
It's real?

375
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:32,821
Of course it is.

376
00:40:32,846 --> 00:40:37,528
Don't ask me how these people have developed
technologies we haven't even dreamed of yet.

377
00:40:37,553 --> 00:40:40,863
Wait.
What people?

378
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:42,103
Oh.

379
00:40:44,918 --> 00:40:47,807
Have you ever wondered
what would happen

380
00:40:47,832 --> 00:40:52,480
if all the geniuses, the artists,
the scientists, the...

381
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:55,554
smartest, most creative
people in the world...

382
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:59,224
decided to actually change it?

383
00:40:59,906 --> 00:41:01,799
But where?

384
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:03,703
Where could they even
do such a thing?

385
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:08,465
They'd need a place free from politics,
bureaucracy, distractions,

386
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,842
greed.

387
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,513
A secret place.

388
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:16,142
Where they could build whatever
they were crazy enough to imagine.

389
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:18,790
'Plus Ultra',
they called themselves.

390
00:41:18,815 --> 00:41:23,308
The only way to see it, however,
is through contact with one of these.

391
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:26,193
Why did they make them?
What are-What are they for?

392
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:27,754
Rumor has it...

393
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,128
They were about
to go public.

394
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:32,392
Share what they had
built with the whole world.

395
00:41:32,393 --> 00:41:34,603
Unfortunately...

396
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:36,760
That never happened.

397
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,691
Why not?

398
00:41:39,011 --> 00:41:42,120
I think we've shared
enough, young lady. I...

399
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:47,671
As, we've decided
to trust you...

400
00:41:47,696 --> 00:41:51,264
Please, trust us.
And tell me,

401
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:52,875
where did you get it?

402
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,410
I don't know.

403
00:41:56,435 --> 00:41:58,489
What do you
mean, honey?

404
00:41:59,193 --> 00:42:02,828
I kinda got arrested and
it was in with my stuff.

405
00:42:02,932 --> 00:42:04,789
In with your stuff?

406
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,933
Yeah, I don't know
how it got there.

407
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,310
What was that?

408
00:42:10,335 --> 00:42:12,789
Tell us who gave
it to you, please?

409
00:42:12,814 --> 00:42:15,187
No one gave
it to me!

410
00:42:15,982 --> 00:42:18,790
It's very unlikely,
sweetheart.

411
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,377
Uh. You know what?

412
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,959
I think I'm gonna go now.

413
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:25,863
Thanks for your help.

414
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:28,066
A $1000 if you tell me
where you acquired the pin.

415
00:42:28,091 --> 00:42:29,319
I don't know.

416
00:42:29,344 --> 00:42:31,345
- 10,000.
- Was it a girl? A little girl?

417
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,213
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

418
00:42:33,238 --> 00:42:35,868
Have a nice day,
enjoy your freakout!

419
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,007
Tell us where she is
and you will be spared.

420
00:42:40,848 --> 00:42:43,249
This is a joke, right?

421
00:42:43,571 --> 00:42:44,884
Wah!

422
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:50,535
Where's the girl?

423
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,994
I-I don't.
I don't know.

424
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:28,908
You will tell us
about the girl.

425
00:43:28,933 --> 00:43:32,366
I don't know any girl.
I told you, I-I don't...

426
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:33,776
Where is the girl?

427
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:36,748
I don't know any girl!

428
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:50,783
We have to go.

429
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:54,169
Come on. Now.

430
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:57,647
This is a time bomb.
Stops time, but not for long.

431
00:43:57,672 --> 00:43:59,659
- What?
- Listen to me.

432
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:03,271
The sphere's collapsing and
you're in the line of fire.

433
00:44:03,372 --> 00:44:07,579
We need to go,
or you will die.

434
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:10,527
I'm stuck.

435
00:44:10,896 --> 00:44:11,993
I'm stuck!

436
00:44:12,018 --> 00:44:14,675
But only temporarily.
Take my hand.

437
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,952
The moment you're
free I'll pull you clear.

438
00:44:16,977 --> 00:44:19,220
And stay behind me.

439
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:20,751
Ready?

440
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,509
The girl!

441
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,950
Look out!

442
00:45:28,961 --> 00:45:30,622
We have to go.

443
00:45:30,692 --> 00:45:33,810
They're about to self-destruct.
We have to go now!

444
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:38,795
 ...crazy enough to imagine.
 ...crazy enough to imagine.

445
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,487
Casey, get up.
They'll be coming.

446
00:45:53,512 --> 00:45:56,036
- What?
- Go!

447
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:00,351
- I know
- I don't know what I...

448
00:46:00,376 --> 00:46:02,746
- Get in, Casey.
- can't get in the car.

449
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:05,972
How do you
know my name?

450
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:08,143
Just get in the car.

451
00:46:22,121 --> 00:46:23,288
What just happened?

452
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,924
2 AA units targeted
you for extermination.

453
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,452
I saved your life,
they self-destructed.

454
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:30,007
Wait.
AAs?

455
00:46:30,032 --> 00:46:31,332
Audio Animatronics.

456
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,754
They were robots?

457
00:46:32,779 --> 00:46:36,287
No, advanced and more...

458
00:46:38,121 --> 00:46:41,641
Sure.
Okay, Robots.

459
00:46:42,747 --> 00:46:44,290
Who are you?

460
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:45,819
My name is Athena.

461
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,042
I'm the one who
gave you the pin.

462
00:46:48,249 --> 00:46:50,188
The pin? The...
Whoa, the-the pin!

463
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:51,292
Yeah.

464
00:46:51,293 --> 00:46:52,747
And I do wish
you hadn't run off

465
00:46:52,772 --> 00:46:55,782
before I had a chance to give you
some rather necessary contexts.

466
00:46:55,807 --> 00:46:58,206
Contexts? What are you
even talking about?

467
00:46:58,231 --> 00:47:00,288
How are you
driving a car!

468
00:47:00,313 --> 00:47:01,381
Who are you?

469
00:47:01,406 --> 00:47:03,668
I'm a recruiter...

470
00:47:03,693 --> 00:47:08,572
re---  I... know--
re re...cruiter...

471
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:18,020
<font color="#8cdaff">60 seconds to self-destruct.</font>

472
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:21,115
My translator is damage.
(Japanese)

473
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:24,672
So sorry about that.

474
00:47:24,673 --> 00:47:27,797
You're...
one of them.

475
00:47:27,822 --> 00:47:29,398
Obviously.

476
00:47:36,692 --> 00:47:38,062
What are you doing?

477
00:47:38,087 --> 00:47:41,267
Stop, I'm trying to help you!

478
00:47:46,418 --> 00:47:48,931
Oh my god.
Oh my god!

479
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:03,578
Hey!

480
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,705
Hey!

481
00:48:14,867 --> 00:48:18,035
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

482
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:22,871
No, way!

483
00:48:34,355 --> 00:48:35,518
Let me out of this car!

484
00:48:35,543 --> 00:48:37,841
- Stop yelling! I will not.
- No!

485
00:48:37,866 --> 00:48:39,708
- Let me out now!
- I will not!

486
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:42,037
 I gave you my very
last pin, young lady.

487
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:44,387
And I am not about
to let it go to waste.

488
00:48:44,412 --> 00:48:47,691
What do you mean
your last pin?

489
00:48:50,438 --> 00:48:53,368
The place I saw.

490
00:48:55,672 --> 00:48:58,802
- It exists?
- Of course, it does.

491
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:01,406
But if you don't
come with me,

492
00:49:01,431 --> 00:49:03,665
it won't for much longer.

493
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:05,385
Why not?

494
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,239
Because they built something
they shouldn't have.

495
00:49:08,299 --> 00:49:10,608
Wha-Built what?

496
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:14,358
Do you want to keep asking me questions
until someone arrives to murder us?

497
00:49:14,383 --> 00:49:15,591
No.

498
00:49:15,616 --> 00:49:18,683
Then which way do
you want to go?

499
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:20,601
Backwards...

500
00:49:21,432 --> 00:49:23,505
Or forwards?

501
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:25,939
And you could
take me there?

502
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,587
I can.

503
00:49:30,286 --> 00:49:31,878
I'm driving.

504
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,365
You fellas are
released. Thanks.

505
00:49:37,782 --> 00:49:39,685
Alrighty, boys.

506
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:44,087
Fire chief says we're cleared
to go in and poke around.

507
00:49:44,112 --> 00:49:47,977
Hopefully, they were out for lunch and
nobody was in there once she went boom.

508
00:49:48,002 --> 00:49:49,424
Captain.

509
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:57,687
Afternoon, sir.
Dave Clark, Secret Service.

510
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,087
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

511
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,843
Looks like you got
yourself a doosy here.

512
00:50:02,868 --> 00:50:04,050
Secret Service?

513
00:50:04,075 --> 00:50:05,546
Hey, where are
they going?

514
00:50:05,571 --> 00:50:07,084
They're securing the premises.

515
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:10,812
Thanks so much for your help,
but we're going to take it from here.

516
00:50:11,703 --> 00:50:15,491
Hey Dale, found this just
outside the window.

517
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:18,416
Ever seen
anything like it?

518
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,693
What the hell?

519
00:50:21,774 --> 00:50:23,359
God almighty!

520
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:26,231
Sale. This week, 70%.
Was it a girl? A little girl?

521
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:29,971
Was it a girl? A little girl?
Was it a girl? A little girl?

522
00:50:31,845 --> 00:50:34,105
You wanna tell me
what's going on here, son?

523
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,807
No, sir.
I do not.

524
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:43,497
Was it a girl?
A little girl?

525
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:45,571
Contact Governor Nix.

526
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,769
Tell him we
found the girl.

527
00:50:49,244 --> 00:50:50,786
Veer left!

528
00:50:51,357 --> 00:50:53,407
A little more of a
heads-up next time.

529
00:50:53,432 --> 00:50:56,072
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you
just tell me where we're going.

530
00:50:56,097 --> 00:50:57,800
Pittsfield of New York.

531
00:50:57,825 --> 00:50:59,702
What's in Pittsfield,
New York?

532
00:50:59,727 --> 00:51:01,617
Someone who can
get us back in.

533
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:05,092
Hold on, you said that
you gave me your last pin.

534
00:51:05,117 --> 00:51:06,823
How many other people
did you give them to?

535
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:08,347
Not important.

536
00:51:08,372 --> 00:51:10,600
I'm not even
your first choice.

537
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:11,964
I only found
you a month ago

538
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:15,154
when you started wantingly
destroying government property.

539
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:18,670
Which happens to go on my search
parameters for recruitment.

540
00:51:18,695 --> 00:51:23,260
Not to mention you scored a 73
on the Feynman Daubert scale.

541
00:51:23,285 --> 00:51:24,898
73?

542
00:51:24,927 --> 00:51:26,196
Is that good?

543
00:51:26,221 --> 00:51:28,745
Wait. Hold-Hold on.
Recruitment for what?

544
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:30,297
I'm not allowed
to answer that.

545
00:51:30,322 --> 00:51:31,520
Who's not allowing you?

546
00:51:31,545 --> 00:51:33,925
I'm not allowed to answer
that and I should warn you.

547
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:37,432
You keep asking me questions and my
countermeasure protocol will initiate.

548
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:39,432
Okay, and what
does that mean?

549
00:51:39,457 --> 00:51:41,758
I will shut down.

550
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:43,903
You will not.

551
00:51:43,928 --> 00:51:45,729
Try me.

552
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:51,992
You said that they built
something they shouldn't have.

553
00:51:52,032 --> 00:51:55,711
Did something happen over there?
Something bad?

554
00:51:56,699 --> 00:51:58,387
Son of a b...!

555
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:16,539
Please don't answer.
Please don't answer.

556
00:52:17,596 --> 00:52:19,776
Hey. You've reached
Eddie Newton's cellphone.

557
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:22,985
Leave me a message
and I will call you back.

558
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:26,688
Hey Dad, it's Casey.
Um.

559
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,981
I told Nate to tell you that I was
camping, but I'm not camping.

560
00:52:30,006 --> 00:52:32,559
I just don't like
lying to you.

561
00:52:33,332 --> 00:52:36,224
But I didn't know how to
tell you the truth because...

562
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:42,639
But something highly
unusual is happening, and...

563
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:45,546
Okay, my point is,

564
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:49,156
I'm fine.
I will continue to be fine.

565
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:52,729
I'm not on drugs.
I haven't joined a cult.

566
00:52:52,991 --> 00:52:54,721
I won't be gone long.

567
00:52:54,746 --> 00:52:56,897
And I will call again soon.

568
00:52:56,922 --> 00:52:58,786
I love you, Dad.

569
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:05,383
OH!
Oh my god!

570
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:06,964
Are you okay?

571
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:09,603
Yes.
Fine, thank you.

572
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:13,200
I thought I
broke you or something.

573
00:53:17,257 --> 00:53:19,196
I should drive.

574
00:53:19,398 --> 00:53:20,644
Casey.

575
00:53:20,669 --> 00:53:22,924
I know you have no
reason to trust me.

576
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:27,514
But I've been looking for someone
like you for a very long time.

577
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:29,745
Now please.

578
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:32,411
Pull over.

579
00:53:42,092 --> 00:53:45,695
Of all the people you could
give one of those pins to...

580
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,326
Why me?

581
00:53:49,624 --> 00:53:51,521
Because you're special.

582
00:53:51,546 --> 00:53:53,190
Oh yeah.

583
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:56,046
- I'm special.
- You are!

584
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:06,410
So this guy we're
gonna go see.

585
00:54:07,686 --> 00:54:09,638
What's his name?

586
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,908
His name is Frank.

587
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:17,041
Frank Walker.

588
00:54:17,736 --> 00:54:19,756
He's special, too.

589
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,578
Frank
Walker.

590
00:54:49,593 --> 00:54:52,917
Hey! Wait!
Where are you going!

591
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:00,420
Great.

592
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:11,635
Where are your paw prints?

593
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,703
That is cool.

594
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:58,742
I can hear you,
you know.

595
00:56:58,767 --> 00:57:00,069
Go away.

596
00:57:00,094 --> 00:57:01,724
Didn't you
see the dog?

597
00:57:01,749 --> 00:57:03,155
Yeah!

598
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:06,787
It's a hologram. How did
you do that in daylight?

599
00:57:06,812 --> 00:57:08,719
- Pretty impressive.
- Who are you?

600
00:57:08,744 --> 00:57:10,207
What do you want?

601
00:57:10,232 --> 00:57:12,870
You're Frank Walker, right?

602
00:57:13,115 --> 00:57:17,462
My name's Casey. And I want
you to take me there.

603
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:19,187
Take you...

604
00:57:19,212 --> 00:57:20,827
where?

605
00:57:20,852 --> 00:57:24,171
To the place I saw
when I touched this.

606
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,109
Where did
you get this?

607
00:57:41,848 --> 00:57:44,620
A little girl.
Athena.

608
00:57:44,793 --> 00:57:46,163
Where is she?

609
00:57:46,188 --> 00:57:48,592
She ditched me here...

610
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,665
Of course, she did.
Look.

611
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,924
Wherever you came
from, kid, go back.

612
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:57,174
No, I want you to
take me there.

613
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:01,167
- What I saw...
- What you saw, is gone.

614
00:58:01,168 --> 00:58:03,768
This, what you're looking for,
it doesn't exist anymore.

615
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:06,196
No, I feel-I feel like,
like I have to go.

616
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:08,260
Like, I'm supposed to go.

617
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:09,588
Why?

618
00:58:09,613 --> 00:58:13,891
Because they're saving a seat
on a rocket ship just for you?

619
00:58:14,936 --> 00:58:18,724
What you saw was a commercial
that was recorded decades ago.

620
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:23,293
It was an invitation that never went out,
because the damn party got canceled.

621
00:58:23,318 --> 00:58:26,261
You are not supposed
to do anything.

622
00:58:26,286 --> 00:58:30,914
You've been manipulated to feel like
you're part of something incredible.

623
00:58:30,982 --> 00:58:33,133
Like you were special.

624
00:58:33,245 --> 00:58:35,091
But you weren't.

625
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:38,005
You're not.

626
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:42,008
So that's a no?

627
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,537
Son of a b...

628
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:31,821
Oh, you little...

629
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,585
You know. I could
call the cops anytime!

630
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,497
Anytime!

631
01:00:38,629 --> 01:00:42,650
You have...
I'm giving you 5 seconds!

632
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,505
I'm not leaving!

633
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:57,008
Either tell me how to
get there, or kill me!

634
01:00:57,033 --> 01:01:01,916
If you touch anything in there,
that's exactly what I'll do!

635
01:01:04,138 --> 01:01:05,198
What are you doing?

636
01:01:05,223 --> 01:01:08,375
I'm touching things!

637
01:01:10,657 --> 01:01:13,677
Open this door, now!

638
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:17,900
I'm serious.
I'll knock you out.

639
01:01:22,265 --> 01:01:26,286
Hey what's this doohickey
with a trombone slidey thing?

640
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:28,483
Don't touch those!
I'm serious!

641
01:01:28,508 --> 01:01:30,042
Will you take me there?

642
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:33,510
- No!
- Then you're not serious!

643
01:01:36,612 --> 01:01:40,632
Oh come on. You didn't
think that was funny?

644
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:42,598
You're recording this?

645
01:01:42,623 --> 01:01:45,024
If I get you to laugh, I wanna,
you know,

646
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:46,968
 have
it for posterity.

647
01:01:46,993 --> 01:01:48,359
I laughed.

648
01:01:48,384 --> 01:01:51,112
You smiled.
A smile's not a laugh.

649
01:01:51,113 --> 01:01:53,985
Everyone laughs.
It's a biological need.

650
01:01:53,986 --> 01:01:57,237
Actually it isn't.
Sleep is a biological need.

651
01:01:57,262 --> 01:01:59,824
And I've never seen
you sleep, either.

652
01:02:01,632 --> 01:02:04,943
Well, sooner or later I'm
gonna make you laugh.

653
01:02:04,968 --> 01:02:07,810
Until you do, I'm not
gonna stop trying.

654
01:02:07,835 --> 01:02:09,905
Maybe you should.

655
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:12,015
What?

656
01:02:12,706 --> 01:02:14,903
Stop trying.

657
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:18,626
Why?

658
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:22,856
Must you record this?

659
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:23,250
- Get out!
- Wait a second.

660
01:03:23,275 --> 01:03:25,300
What is-What is that?
Is that a countdown?

661
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:27,702
I am not leaving. I deserve to
know what's going on around here.

662
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:29,704
- You deserve?
- Yeah, I deserve some answers.

663
01:03:29,729 --> 01:03:31,545
- Answers to what?
- I know that you were there.

664
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:32,692
You don't know anything.

665
01:03:32,717 --> 01:03:34,435
How can you ever
leave a place like that?

666
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,695
Because they
threw me out!

667
01:03:42,008 --> 01:03:46,390
They threw me out and they
locked every door back in.

668
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:52,071
Was it because you built that
something that you shouldn't have?

669
01:03:52,096 --> 01:03:53,794
Who told you that?

670
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:58,602
Is that it?
The something?

671
01:04:00,945 --> 01:04:03,289
If I could tell
you the date...

672
01:04:03,314 --> 01:04:05,524
The exact date that
you're gonna die...

673
01:04:05,549 --> 01:04:08,104
- Would you wanna know?
- How would you know?

674
01:04:08,129 --> 01:04:10,230
- Let's just say I did.
- What, are you psychic?

675
01:04:10,255 --> 01:04:12,159
- No, that's not the point.
- Then what is your basis for knowing this.

676
01:04:12,184 --> 01:04:16,987
Hypothetical. Alright, just-just
use your imagination. Alright?

677
01:04:17,276 --> 01:04:19,365
- Alright.
- Okay.

678
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:23,367
Just accept that there's a world
where I know with absolute certainty,

679
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:26,841
the exact time of your death.

680
01:04:27,215 --> 01:04:28,279
Now.

681
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:30,150
You want me to
tell you or not?

682
01:04:30,175 --> 01:04:33,031
Of course, I would.
Who wouldn't?

683
01:04:33,672 --> 01:04:34,976
But.

684
01:04:35,686 --> 01:04:37,211
What if...

685
01:04:37,489 --> 01:04:40,407
Accepting my death
is what causes it,

686
01:04:40,432 --> 01:04:42,077
so the answer is "Yes".

687
01:04:42,102 --> 01:04:44,240
I would want you to tell me,

688
01:04:44,265 --> 01:04:46,179
- But I wouldn't believe you.
- You have to believe me.

689
01:04:46,204 --> 01:04:49,799
Why? Don't we like, make
our own destiny and stuff?

690
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:58,644
What?

691
01:05:05,494 --> 01:05:07,722
Who are you, kid?

692
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,910
Is that bad?

693
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:18,117
Oh, hell.

694
01:05:18,142 --> 01:05:20,030
Oh, hell!

695
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:33,628
- They followed you here?
- What? Who?

696
01:05:33,653 --> 01:05:35,294
Robots.

697
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:38,802
I've never seen
them before.

698
01:05:38,827 --> 01:05:40,628
John Francis Walker.

699
01:05:40,653 --> 01:05:43,827
You have been permitted to live based
upon your agreed non-intervention.

700
01:05:43,852 --> 01:05:46,296
You are now harboring
a fugitive element.

701
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:48,928
Release her to our custody
or be extinguished.

702
01:05:48,953 --> 01:05:51,430
You have 1 minute to comply.

703
01:06:07,081 --> 01:06:09,488
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me yet.

704
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:18,451
Huh!

705
01:06:27,915 --> 01:06:29,485
Wait.

706
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,537
Come on!

707
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,304
Look out!

708
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:01,553
Go.

709
01:08:07,732 --> 01:08:10,129
John Francis Walker.
By authority of Governor Nix.

710
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:13,537
This unit has been authorized...
to extinguish your life...

711
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:18,462
Okay.

712
01:08:22,985 --> 01:08:24,260
Okay.

713
01:08:26,546 --> 01:08:29,503
Alright, that's enough.
That's enough.

714
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:34,507
Come on.
Close the door.

715
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,639
Who the hell
is Governor Nix?

716
01:08:38,434 --> 01:08:40,620
Let's go.
Come on.

717
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,506
How is this
a good idea?

718
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,996
Whoa!

719
01:09:20,582 --> 01:09:21,919
Move or sink, kid!

720
01:09:21,944 --> 01:09:24,700
You were actually
prepared for that?

721
01:09:33,894 --> 01:09:35,619
- My hat.
- Leave it.

722
01:09:35,644 --> 01:09:38,165
No no no.
I can't go without it.

723
01:09:44,104 --> 01:09:46,056
It's my dad's.

724
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:51,209
You're too smart
for your own good.

725
01:09:51,985 --> 01:09:55,599
Your father never understood you,
never supported you.

726
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,890
Now you wear his hat,

727
01:09:57,915 --> 01:09:59,654
as a badge or rebellion.

728
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,192
Right?

729
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,756
No.
My Dad is amazing.

730
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:10,663
Oh. Wait a second.
We're not...

731
01:10:10,927 --> 01:10:13,478
We're not talking about me,
are we?

732
01:10:15,927 --> 01:10:18,304
Well, we just get you
to your amazing dad...

733
01:10:18,329 --> 01:10:20,690
Pretend this never happened.

734
01:10:21,038 --> 01:10:22,637
Hop on.

735
01:10:24,957 --> 01:10:26,551
- Battery's dead.
- No, it's not.

736
01:10:26,576 --> 01:10:29,038
- Well maybe it's the point.
- No, it's not.

737
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:31,819
- When's the last time you tried...
- You know you're not helping?

738
01:10:34,538 --> 01:10:36,783
Get down.
Now.

739
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:52,090
Wait.

740
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:56,946
Hello, Frank.

741
01:11:03,745 --> 01:11:06,250
Are you going
to shoot me?

742
01:11:07,678 --> 01:11:10,439
- I'm deciding...
- Could you decide in the truck?

743
01:11:10,464 --> 01:11:13,028
Because we really
should get going.

744
01:11:13,991 --> 01:11:15,340
Wait.

745
01:11:15,365 --> 01:11:17,992
Why, so more
robots can show up?

746
01:11:20,305 --> 01:11:21,734
She's one of 'em.

747
01:11:21,759 --> 01:11:24,344
Yeah, I know.
Are you coming or not?

748
01:11:30,025 --> 01:11:32,144
Move over.

749
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:52,275
- Frank?
- Not yet.

750
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,862
What were you thinking, why
would you drag her into this?

751
01:11:55,887 --> 01:11:58,076
I didn't drag her into anything.

752
01:11:58,101 --> 01:12:01,610
I gave her a pin.
She did the rest.

753
01:12:02,044 --> 01:12:03,115
Just like you.

754
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:06,587
Oh, don't even...And where
did you even find the pin?

755
01:12:06,612 --> 01:12:08,132
I was there.
They destroyed them.

756
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,296
Not all of them. I made it
out with nearly a dozen.

757
01:12:11,321 --> 01:12:12,638
So you give one
to a teenager?

758
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:16,198
Hey, I got a 73 on the Feinberg-
Dusseldorf scale or whatever.

759
01:12:16,223 --> 01:12:18,682
- You got a 73? That's not possible.
- Mm-Hm.

760
01:12:18,707 --> 01:12:20,914
He's jealous because
he scored 41.

761
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:22,981
Wha... You know what?
I was 11.

762
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:24,692
I was 11.

763
01:12:24,717 --> 01:12:26,580
Don't touch that!

764
01:12:26,605 --> 01:12:31,067
This is a 1 kiloton detonation,
it is not a toy.

765
01:12:31,092 --> 01:12:33,676
Do not mess with my stuff.
You got it?

766
01:12:33,701 --> 01:12:37,129
- Sorry.
- I didn't begin with her, you know.

767
01:12:37,154 --> 01:12:39,997
I wasted years holding
out for potential candidates.

768
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,770
Potential candidates?
For what?

769
01:12:43,207 --> 01:12:44,413
Oh-ho-ho...

770
01:12:44,438 --> 01:12:47,681
That's beautiful. You still think
you're recruiting, don't you?

771
01:12:47,706 --> 01:12:49,480
Do not ask her any
more questions.

772
01:12:49,505 --> 01:12:51,225
She's gonna do her
countermeasure shutdown thing.

773
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,467
What countermeasure shutdown?

774
01:12:52,492 --> 01:12:54,588
Did you tell her you had a
countermeasure shutdown thing?

775
01:12:54,613 --> 01:12:58,397
- She was annoying me.
- What...? You-You lied?

776
01:12:58,422 --> 01:12:59,693
Get used to that, kid.

777
01:12:59,718 --> 01:13:01,774
One minute, she's promising
you a beautiful future.

778
01:13:01,799 --> 01:13:04,230
Next thing you know, she's
leading it to your house to kill you.

779
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:07,688
I'm sorry. But time is running
out and you needed motivation.

780
01:13:07,713 --> 01:13:09,467
Motivation for what?

781
01:13:09,492 --> 01:13:11,575
We need to go
back over, Frank.

782
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,874
Back over there?

783
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:14,465
Yes! Yes! Frank, we
need to go back over.

784
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,061
Good! Great.
That's just great.

785
01:13:16,086 --> 01:13:20,068
You know, "Hey, I got stung by
a bee, let's jump on the hive."

786
01:13:20,093 --> 01:13:21,365
That's a terrible analogy.

787
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:24,411
That's a fantastic analogy! What
do you know about analogy?

788
01:13:24,436 --> 01:13:26,658
You know you're impossible
to talk to when you're like this.

789
01:13:26,683 --> 01:13:31,574
I am like this, because
you derailed my life! Again!

790
01:13:31,599 --> 01:13:36,950
Frank, it's not personal.
It's just programming.

791
01:13:38,387 --> 01:13:40,203
We're here!

792
01:13:46,893 --> 01:13:47,990
Where are you going?

793
01:13:48,015 --> 01:13:50,995
This is where your wire
station's located, isn't it?

794
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,638
We need to get to
the Spectacle.

795
01:13:52,663 --> 01:13:55,283
- Spectacle?
- Hey. Are you insane?

796
01:13:55,308 --> 01:13:57,709
They know that you sent her to me,
they're gonna be waiting for us.

797
01:13:57,734 --> 01:14:00,590
Fine. Give me the Edison tube
and we'll go without you.

798
01:14:00,615 --> 01:14:02,576
I don't have the
Edison tube.

799
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:04,473
It's in your bag.

800
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,453
I have X-ray vision.

801
01:14:06,478 --> 01:14:09,189
- When did you get X-ray vision?
- Oh. She's full of surprises.

802
01:14:09,214 --> 01:14:12,372
I know all about her surprises.
Chief among them is this,

803
01:14:12,397 --> 01:14:14,597
she doesn't care about you.

804
01:14:14,622 --> 01:14:18,717
All that charm and the sense of
purpose and the cute little smile.

805
01:14:18,742 --> 01:14:20,282
It's all just software.

806
01:14:20,307 --> 01:14:23,351
It's 1s and 0s.
That's it.

807
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:27,128
Trust me, when you get
there, you're on your own.

808
01:14:28,019 --> 01:14:29,858
What happened to you two?

809
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:31,160
He thinks
I hurt him.

810
01:14:31,185 --> 01:14:35,466
No. You hurt a dumb kid that
was stupid enough to fall...

811
01:14:40,019 --> 01:14:42,874
You were many things,
Frank Walker.

812
01:14:44,952 --> 01:14:47,335
But you were
never dumb.

813
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,802
Why don't you just
give me the Edison tube?

814
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:55,592
- I'm not giving you anything.
- And...

815
01:14:55,619 --> 01:14:56,859
I'm...!

816
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:03,689
Alright.

817
01:15:03,714 --> 01:15:07,955
You want in? I'll
bring you in. Why not.

818
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:12,356
What's better than waiting around here and
getting hunted and killed, etc, etc.

819
01:15:12,381 --> 01:15:14,141
- That's the spirit!
- Et cetera?

820
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:16,516
What's the et cetera?

821
01:15:39,799 --> 01:15:41,340
What kind of cables are these?

822
01:15:41,365 --> 01:15:43,102
The kind that transmit people.

823
01:15:43,127 --> 01:15:46,507
People, like us?
What, like a miniature teleport...

824
01:15:46,532 --> 01:15:48,145
Do I have to
explain everything?

825
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:51,698
Can't you just be
amazed and move on?

826
01:15:51,723 --> 01:15:54,811
This is all wired to
the dish up there.

827
01:15:57,688 --> 01:16:00,772
Are you-
Are you using satellite?

828
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,320
I know how things work.

829
01:16:04,672 --> 01:16:07,050
Well, zip-a-Dee-doo for you.

830
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:10,160
Wrap this around your eyes, tight.

831
01:16:10,161 --> 01:16:13,848
- Why?
- Because justice is blind.

832
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,393
Just.
Do it, kid.

833
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:21,278
You want me to put
this over my head?

834
01:16:22,107 --> 01:16:23,476
- If this sticks on my eyebrows...
- Shut up.

835
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:25,593
Open your mouth,
tilt your head back.

836
01:16:25,733 --> 01:16:28,734
Awk.
What is that?

837
01:16:28,759 --> 01:16:31,081
Powder.
Will ya back off?

838
01:16:31,106 --> 01:16:32,665
Good to go!

839
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,866
Good. Did you set it
for the tower?

840
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:36,595
There is still a
receiver there.

841
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:38,061
Last I checked.

842
01:16:38,086 --> 01:16:39,956
How long ago was that?

843
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,743
25 years ago.

844
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,740
Roughly.

845
01:16:52,949 --> 01:16:55,054
They threw you out too?

846
01:16:55,501 --> 01:16:59,077
Okay guys, killer robots.

847
01:16:59,305 --> 01:17:02,903
Alright. It's gonna be bright,
cold, and really loud.

848
01:17:02,928 --> 01:17:06,836
You're gonna lose 90% of your
blood sugar in 1/100 of a per second

849
01:17:06,861 --> 01:17:08,596
and you're gonna wish
you were dead.

850
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:10,479
By then, it'll be over.

851
01:17:11,349 --> 01:17:12,908
Don't pee on us.

852
01:17:12,933 --> 01:17:15,856
This sounds spectacular.

853
01:17:17,376 --> 01:17:20,314
Why now?
Why her?

854
01:17:20,366 --> 01:17:22,503
Because she
hasn't given up.

855
01:17:22,528 --> 01:17:24,804
You think she can fix it.

856
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:27,285
What makes
you say that?

857
01:17:29,713 --> 01:17:31,787
Can she, Athena?

858
01:17:32,024 --> 01:17:34,023
I have no idea.

859
01:17:34,906 --> 01:17:37,190
Let's go find out.

860
01:17:48,313 --> 01:17:50,352
Hold on.

861
01:17:50,377 --> 01:17:53,395
Is this-
Is this normal?

862
01:17:57,194 --> 01:18:00,934
What... is... happen... ing...?

863
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,438
I'm thirsty.
I'm dying.

864
01:18:15,463 --> 01:18:16,694
I think I'm dying.

865
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,876
- I'm dying. I'm dying.
- You're not dying.

866
01:18:18,901 --> 01:18:21,139
There's coke
in the fridge.

867
01:18:39,067 --> 01:18:40,654
Help yourself.

868
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,476
We have no idea
how many are here.

869
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:45,442
But we're damn sure
they know we're coming. So.

870
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:49,446
We move quickly, you follow me.
No questions, got it?

871
01:18:50,413 --> 01:18:52,198
- Got it.
- Alright.

872
01:18:59,799 --> 01:19:01,565
Excuse me.

873
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,636
We're in Paris?

874
01:19:24,661 --> 01:19:26,281
Would you stop
being so amazed?

875
01:19:26,306 --> 01:19:29,269
- I thought you wanted me to be amazed.
- I want you to stop yapping.

876
01:19:29,294 --> 01:19:35,308
<i>(French speaker over PA)</i>

877
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,776
Tower's closing.

878
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:38,916
Oh, hell.

879
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:45,184
Come here.

880
01:19:45,395 --> 01:19:47,468
Now. You and I are gonna
be on their watch list.

881
01:19:47,493 --> 01:19:50,821
They may not have your facial
recognition profile uploaded yet.

882
01:19:50,846 --> 01:19:52,589
- May not?
- May not, so...

883
01:19:52,614 --> 01:19:55,463
You walk over there, you take
this, you tap him on the neck.

884
01:19:55,464 --> 01:19:57,010
If he's human,
it knocks him right out.

885
01:19:57,035 --> 01:19:58,814
And if it's a robot?

886
01:19:59,866 --> 01:20:02,175
- Hey.
- Then you'll just pissed it off.

887
01:20:02,274 --> 01:20:04,005
Fantastic.

888
01:20:06,907 --> 01:20:09,056
She got guts.
You gotta give her that.

889
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:17,606
Human!

890
01:20:33,983 --> 01:20:36,337
The French hated this thing
when Eiffel first unveiled it

891
01:20:36,362 --> 01:20:39,300
at the Paris World's Fair.
They thought it was an eyesore.

892
01:20:39,325 --> 01:20:42,300
Eiffel didn't care though. It wasn't
meant to be a monument.

893
01:20:42,325 --> 01:20:44,482
It was meant to find
another world.

894
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:47,142
Le cat premiere.

895
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:48,670
Plus Ultra's first four.

896
01:20:48,695 --> 01:20:50,339
They were a
part of all this?

897
01:20:50,364 --> 01:20:55,606
Eiffel, Jules Verne,
Tesla, and Mr. Edison.

898
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:58,247
They designed this
antenna that we're inside...

899
01:20:58,272 --> 01:21:00,154
Wait, what?
The Eiffel Tower's an antenna?

900
01:21:00,139 --> 01:21:02,526
Now I finally answer your question.
Are you gonna interrupt me?

901
01:21:02,551 --> 01:21:07,028
Yes, Tesla designed the antenna to
observe every kind of frequency out there.

902
01:21:07,053 --> 01:21:09,498
Subspace, trans-dimensional,
you name it.

903
01:21:09,523 --> 01:21:12,146
And, they found exactly what
they were looking for.

904
01:21:12,171 --> 01:21:14,194
And then, Edison tried to
take credit for it,

905
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:16,975
- because these two hate each other they....
- Frank.

906
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,661
Stay on topic.

907
01:21:18,686 --> 01:21:20,047
Yeah.

908
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:25,800
There were all these rumors,
of a secret entrance...

909
01:21:25,825 --> 01:21:31,941
the four kept just for themselves,
a one way ticket...

910
01:21:32,172 --> 01:21:34,910
in case of emergencies.

911
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:40,239
The Spectacle.

912
01:22:12,373 --> 01:22:14,942
You ain't seen nothing yet, kid.

913
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:13,267
Oh no.
The tour is over.

914
01:23:19,906 --> 01:23:22,034
It's a rocket.

915
01:23:25,813 --> 01:23:27,690
They're coming.

916
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:29,838
Alright.

917
01:23:47,806 --> 01:23:49,553
Buckle up.

918
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:09,115
- What'd he say?
- Pretty much what you'd expect.

919
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:11,238
Tell them to hang on.

920
01:24:24,936 --> 01:24:28,169
WOO...  HOO...!

921
01:25:21,988 --> 01:25:24,148
- Why are we going back?
- We're not.

922
01:25:24,173 --> 01:25:26,769
We're going through.
To another dimension.

923
01:25:26,794 --> 01:25:30,256
So we blasted into outer space
just to get a running start?

924
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:32,867
This part may
get a little weird.

925
01:26:28,087 --> 01:26:29,578
Casey.

926
01:26:29,613 --> 01:26:31,335
Wake up.

927
01:26:33,059 --> 01:26:34,636
Casey?

928
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,522
Casey.
Wake up.

929
01:26:38,547 --> 01:26:40,389
We're here.

930
01:27:26,466 --> 01:27:27,986
Now what?

931
01:27:29,179 --> 01:27:30,837
You tell me.

932
01:27:31,186 --> 01:27:33,195
I tell you?
This was your idea.

933
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:36,679
I don't have ideas. I just
find the people who do.

934
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:38,622
- So there's no plan.
- There's a plan.

935
01:27:38,647 --> 01:27:40,881
You just haven't
come up with it yet.

936
01:27:41,326 --> 01:27:44,287
But, you should
do that soon.

937
01:27:47,587 --> 01:27:49,950
That's just terrific.

938
01:27:50,066 --> 01:27:52,260
Here. Hide this.

939
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:53,760
Absolutely.

940
01:27:53,785 --> 01:27:57,856
Wait, is that the 1 kiloton detonation
thingy you told me not to play with?

941
01:27:57,881 --> 01:27:59,286
Right now,
it's our insurance policy.

942
01:27:59,311 --> 01:28:01,691
There's a good chance they're gonna
try and kill us right at the gate.

943
01:28:01,716 --> 01:28:03,909
So we're just
gonna stand here?

944
01:28:03,934 --> 01:28:07,769
Well, you wanted to see Tomorrowland.

945
01:28:07,794 --> 01:28:09,700
Here it comes.

946
01:28:35,451 --> 01:28:37,222
Take the bag.

947
01:28:42,786 --> 01:28:45,503
- Frank.
- David.

948
01:28:45,693 --> 01:28:47,511
You look well.

949
01:28:47,536 --> 01:28:49,067
Age becomes you.

950
01:28:49,092 --> 01:28:51,302
Thanks.
You should try it.

951
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:54,552
I don't know. I think I'll just keep
drinking my shake every morning.

952
01:28:54,577 --> 01:28:56,276
Comes in chocolate now.

953
01:28:56,301 --> 01:28:57,769
Yum.

954
01:29:00,684 --> 01:29:02,324
Hello, Athena.

955
01:29:02,349 --> 01:29:05,103
Started to think you
were never coming home.

956
01:29:05,335 --> 01:29:07,620
Where oh where
have you been?

957
01:29:07,621 --> 01:29:08,900
Doing my job.

958
01:29:08,901 --> 01:29:10,599
Your job?

959
01:29:10,624 --> 01:29:14,335
I'm sorry, were we not clear when we
suspended your recruitment protocols?

960
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,928
I got that since when you
called me bloody obsolete

961
01:29:16,953 --> 01:29:19,357
and tried to disassemble me.

962
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,668
Well, you certainly caused
quite a commotion

963
01:29:22,693 --> 01:29:27,314
by launching an antique
rocket ship out of the Eiffel tower!

964
01:29:27,831 --> 01:29:29,401
Under normal circumstances,

965
01:29:29,426 --> 01:29:33,055
we'd be working overtime to convince
everyone it was just an elaborate hoax...

966
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,648
Unfortunately, for all of us, it
doesn't really matter now, does it?

967
01:29:37,673 --> 01:29:39,700
Why doesn't it matter?

968
01:29:41,028 --> 01:29:43,221
And who might you be?

969
01:29:43,246 --> 01:29:47,392
I'm- I'm Casey
Newton.

970
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:50,871
And who-
who might you be?

971
01:29:50,896 --> 01:29:54,882
David Nix.
Pleasure.

972
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:57,310
Well, Frank, it's been
wonderful catching up.

973
01:29:57,335 --> 01:30:00,513
But as we were fairly clear
about the terms of your exile,

974
01:30:00,538 --> 01:30:02,703
and the consequences of violating it,

975
01:30:02,728 --> 01:30:04,007
I have to ask.

976
01:30:04,032 --> 01:30:05,909
What the hell
are you doing here?

977
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:08,231
I think she
can fix it.

978
01:30:11,292 --> 01:30:12,679
I'm sorry, I...

979
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:15,586
Her. I think she
can fix it, David.

980
01:30:15,611 --> 01:30:16,754
Wait, what?

981
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:19,206
I've been pirating your signal.
Every time you turn it on here,

982
01:30:19,231 --> 01:30:20,640
I can see it there.

983
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:25,264
And it flickered.
The percentage dropped, David.

984
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,142
Impossible.

985
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:29,041
You don't believe me,
let's go find out, right now.

986
01:30:29,079 --> 01:30:31,439
I'm sorry,
what can I fix?

987
01:30:31,464 --> 01:30:37,834
The world, Ms. Newton. He
thinks you can fix the world.

988
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:03,354
Is that like a
portal to Earth?

989
01:31:03,379 --> 01:31:07,641
No.
It is a bridge way to Earth.

990
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:15,577
Welcome back to
The Monitor, Frank.

991
01:31:15,859 --> 01:31:18,077
It's something, isn't it?

992
01:31:18,592 --> 01:31:20,831
Yeah, it's something.

993
01:31:36,559 --> 01:31:38,774
Don't worry about
the light show.

994
01:31:38,799 --> 01:31:40,832
It's perfectly safe.

995
01:31:43,413 --> 01:31:46,555
- Am I supposed to do something?
- No.

996
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:49,715
Okay, can you be a bit more specific
because fixing the world sounds a little...

997
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:52,028
Just be yourself.

998
01:31:52,499 --> 01:31:54,233
Gotcha.

999
01:31:58,707 --> 01:32:00,082
What are those?

1000
01:32:00,107 --> 01:32:02,232
Flashes of future.

1001
01:32:02,617 --> 01:32:05,084
That's a few seconds from now.

1002
01:32:05,109 --> 01:32:09,107
This whole tower
funnels energy by tachyon.

1003
01:32:09,132 --> 01:32:11,454
A particle that moves
significantly faster than light.

1004
01:32:11,479 --> 01:32:14,201
We discovered them
almost forty years ago.

1005
01:32:14,226 --> 01:32:18,077
Your physicists are still
arguing over whether they exist.

1006
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:24,147
Oh, dear.
Too late.

1007
01:32:40,078 --> 01:32:42,685
So.
On with the show.

1008
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,418
We've enhanced the
interface significantly.

1009
01:32:45,443 --> 01:32:48,788
There's still functions on
your original algorithm.

1010
01:32:49,813 --> 01:32:52,129
You have something
to show me, Frank?

1011
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:54,182
Show me.

1012
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:07,382
Pick a place.

1013
01:33:08,072 --> 01:33:10,344
- What?
- A location. Anywhere in the world.

1014
01:33:10,369 --> 01:33:11,826
Pick one.

1015
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:17,252
Canaveral,
Cape Canaveral.

1016
01:33:31,509 --> 01:33:32,867
Easy.

1017
01:33:32,926 --> 01:33:37,421
The Interface is oriented from
your hands to the center of the Earth.

1018
01:33:37,447 --> 01:33:39,692
Okay, I got it.

1019
01:33:44,825 --> 01:33:46,987
You've trained her, obviously.

1020
01:33:47,012 --> 01:33:49,110
I just met her yesterday.

1021
01:33:49,599 --> 01:33:51,533
She knows how things work.

1022
01:33:59,185 --> 01:34:00,522
How is this possible?

1023
01:34:00,547 --> 01:34:03,515
We are millions of
exponential deviances

1024
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:05,718
away from the dimension
you call home.

1025
01:34:05,743 --> 01:34:09,553
Frank had the noble idea of building
this machine so that we could

1026
01:34:09,578 --> 01:34:11,607
keep in touch.

1027
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,116
This is 3 days ago.

1028
01:34:14,141 --> 01:34:15,683
Relatively.

1029
01:34:16,893 --> 01:34:20,153
That's
space-time humor.

1030
01:34:22,046 --> 01:34:25,276
Because tachyons
travel faster than light,

1031
01:34:25,301 --> 01:34:26,876
once we harness them...

1032
01:34:26,901 --> 01:34:29,710
You can see
backwards in time.

1033
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,743
Not just backwards.

1034
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,665
You're kidding.

1035
01:34:36,026 --> 01:34:37,386
No.

1036
01:35:01,599 --> 01:35:03,134
What happened?

1037
01:35:03,159 --> 01:35:04,821
Keep going.

1038
01:35:05,233 --> 01:35:07,219
Just a little further.

1039
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:55,631
That's enough.

1040
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:58,708
That's enough, kid.

1041
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:06,180
That's my house.

1042
01:36:06,522 --> 01:36:10,347
Would have been nice, if Frank
had prepared you for this.

1043
01:36:10,372 --> 01:36:13,294
I'm afraid the world is ending.

1044
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:19,170
It is certain, it is
unavoidable, and it is coming.

1045
01:36:19,373 --> 01:36:20,790
When?

1046
01:36:21,546 --> 01:36:24,083
This is 58 days from now.

1047
01:36:24,108 --> 01:36:26,441
58 days?

1048
01:36:26,466 --> 01:36:29,923
Whatever caused this, could happen
anytime after the static starts.

1049
01:36:29,948 --> 01:36:33,388
It could be a month,
could be sooner.

1050
01:36:42,436 --> 01:36:45,322
Still looking for your flicker, Frank?

1051
01:36:45,347 --> 01:36:47,322
I know what I saw.

1052
01:36:48,495 --> 01:36:50,947
So why aren't you
telling anyone?

1053
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:55,678
The whole planet is gonna die,
and you're just, sitting here?

1054
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:58,157
We're not gonna die.

1055
01:36:58,182 --> 01:37:00,478
This is your world, not ours.

1056
01:37:00,503 --> 01:37:02,161
We'll be perfectly
fine here.

1057
01:37:02,172 --> 01:37:05,436
Then why don't
you let people in?

1058
01:37:05,809 --> 01:37:09,249
- Tell her, David.
- Oh, Frank.

1059
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:13,190
All those years in exile and
you still don't understand.

1060
01:37:13,215 --> 01:37:16,348
These people are...
They're driven by savagery.

1061
01:37:16,373 --> 01:37:19,406
If we told them
about this place,

1062
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:23,291
then that, would
happen here, to us.

1063
01:37:23,316 --> 01:37:24,881
Then nothing would survive.

1064
01:37:24,906 --> 01:37:27,272
But it hasn't happened yet.

1065
01:37:27,297 --> 01:37:29,842
Actually it has happened.
You just haven't accepted it.

1066
01:37:29,867 --> 01:37:32,245
Well I don't accept it.

1067
01:37:38,558 --> 01:37:40,951
You see that?
Did you see that?

1068
01:37:40,976 --> 01:37:43,996
David, I know that you saw that.
That means that there is a chance.

1069
01:37:44,021 --> 01:37:46,176
There's at
least a chance.

1070
01:37:53,062 --> 01:37:54,962
That went quite well,
don't you think?

1071
01:37:54,987 --> 01:37:56,494
What happened?

1072
01:37:56,519 --> 01:37:58,612
You're being deported...

1073
01:37:59,213 --> 01:38:00,536
again.

1074
01:38:00,561 --> 01:38:03,268
Well,
that's Nix for you.

1075
01:38:03,293 --> 01:38:05,558
No new ideas.

1076
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:09,022
Apparently your 1/10.000
furball in the inevitability

1077
01:38:09,047 --> 01:38:12,242
wasn’t convincing enough
to change his mind.

1078
01:38:17,446 --> 01:38:19,161
Be gentle.

1079
01:38:29,819 --> 01:38:31,459
You okay?

1080
01:38:32,931 --> 01:38:36,740
I know you think somewhere in the
zillions of questions that I was asking you,

1081
01:38:36,765 --> 01:38:40,593
you could've said, "Oh, Casey.
Well that's stuff not really the issue

1082
01:38:40,618 --> 01:38:44,813
because our future predicting machine
says we're all gonna die."

1083
01:38:44,838 --> 01:38:46,716
He did sort of
hinted at it.

1084
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:49,951
This place has nothing
to do with hope.

1085
01:38:49,976 --> 01:38:52,754
- It's the opposite of hope.
- Come on, don't say that.

1086
01:38:52,779 --> 01:38:56,388
Why not?
You said it.

1087
01:38:56,683 --> 01:38:58,499
No wonder you gave up.

1088
01:38:58,524 --> 01:39:00,693
That's before I knew about you.

1089
01:39:00,718 --> 01:39:02,819
You really...

1090
01:39:02,844 --> 01:39:03,994
You really are special.

1091
01:39:04,019 --> 01:39:06,521
Why do you people
keep saying that to me?

1092
01:39:08,732 --> 01:39:10,783
I'm not.

1093
01:39:14,844 --> 01:39:17,263
Why'd you even give me this?
Hm.

1094
01:39:17,288 --> 01:39:22,547
You showed me a place, that was
amazing and incredible, and it was a lie.

1095
01:39:23,677 --> 01:39:25,518
If you're gonna zap an
idea into people's heads,

1096
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:27,291
you should really make
sure that it's the truth.

1097
01:39:27,316 --> 01:39:30,302
Because you can't do that.
You can't just zap...

1098
01:39:40,063 --> 01:39:41,541
What?

1099
01:39:42,157 --> 01:39:44,674
You zap an idea
into people's heads.

1100
01:39:47,671 --> 01:39:50,228
You were pirating the signal.
How?

1101
01:39:50,253 --> 01:39:51,637
- What?
- At your house,

1102
01:39:51,662 --> 01:39:53,460
all your TVs,
your doomsday room.

1103
01:39:53,485 --> 01:39:55,388
You were boosting the feed
from that Monitor thing.

1104
01:39:55,413 --> 01:39:57,176
- How did you do that?
- No big deal.

1105
01:39:57,201 --> 01:40:00,761
They're running so much power through
it now, a ham radio can pick it up.

1106
01:40:00,786 --> 01:40:03,722
It's just a matter of
finding the right frequency.

1107
01:40:04,966 --> 01:40:07,268
You grabbed a signal from
another dimension.

1108
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:11,082
From a machine here. That
means it's transmitting there.

1109
01:40:11,107 --> 01:40:14,670
What if it's not just
predicting the future.

1110
01:40:14,695 --> 01:40:16,152
He's broadcasting it.

1111
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:18,751
When I touched this thing,
for a few minutes,

1112
01:40:18,776 --> 01:40:20,434
it felt like anything
was possible.

1113
01:40:20,459 --> 01:40:23,112
So then why can't the
opposite happen?

1114
01:40:23,137 --> 01:40:25,761
What if The Monitor
is just a giant pin,

1115
01:40:25,786 --> 01:40:29,648
but instead of making you think positive,
it makes you think negative. And it...

1116
01:40:31,179 --> 01:40:32,618
And it's...

1117
01:40:33,151 --> 01:40:36,673
convincing the whole world
to feed the wrong wolf.

1118
01:40:37,336 --> 01:40:39,683
We need to turn
that thing off.

1119
01:40:44,711 --> 01:40:46,812
It's time
to go home.

1120
01:40:52,402 --> 01:40:54,664
David.
David.

1121
01:40:54,851 --> 01:40:57,902
- Ah! It's uninhabited and uncharted.
- Listen to me.

1122
01:40:57,927 --> 01:41:00,397
But it looks like a lovely
place to spend your last days.

1123
01:41:00,422 --> 01:41:02,987
David, The Monitor is
acting as an antenna.

1124
01:41:03,012 --> 01:41:05,051
It isn't just receiving tachyons,

1125
01:41:05,076 --> 01:41:07,789
it is taking a possible
future and making it like...

1126
01:41:07,814 --> 01:41:10,134
Amplifying it, transmitting
it, like a feedback loop.

1127
01:41:10,159 --> 01:41:13,420
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy
that is coming from right there.

1128
01:41:13,445 --> 01:41:15,328
But it's not just showing people
the end of the world.

1129
01:41:15,353 --> 01:41:16,895
It's giving them the idea
over and over

1130
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,383
- and over again until they just accept it.
- It's a ticking time bomb.

1131
01:41:19,408 --> 01:41:20,675
And we're the ones
that lit the fuse.

1132
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,512
We still have 58 days
to try and change things,

1133
01:41:23,537 --> 01:41:26,309
 but nothing will work as long
as that thing is still on.

1134
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:30,332
Young lady, I'm gonna assume that your
knowledge of tachyonic fusion is a little sketchy.

1135
01:41:30,357 --> 01:41:33,768
Shutting it down is impossible.

1136
01:41:33,793 --> 01:41:36,145
There is no 'Off'.

1137
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:40,483
I'm telling you what it's doing.
Why don't you care?

1138
01:41:41,116 --> 01:41:43,694
Because he's the one
that's doing it.

1139
01:41:49,252 --> 01:41:50,744
Right?

1140
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:56,141
Let's imagine

1141
01:41:57,414 --> 01:41:59,998
If you glimpse the future,

1142
01:42:00,023 --> 01:42:03,416
and were frightened by what you saw,
what would you do with that information?

1143
01:42:03,441 --> 01:42:06,947
Would you go to
politicians?

1144
01:42:06,972 --> 01:42:09,412
Captains of industry?
And how would you convince them?

1145
01:42:09,437 --> 01:42:12,204
With data, facts?

1146
01:42:12,485 --> 01:42:13,641
Good luck.

1147
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:15,215
The only facts they won't challenge,

1148
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:17,323
are the ones that keep
the wheels greased,

1149
01:42:17,348 --> 01:42:19,141
and the dollars rolling in.

1150
01:42:19,166 --> 01:42:23,610
But what if there was a way
of skipping the middle man,

1151
01:42:23,635 --> 01:42:28,074
and putting the critical news
directly into everyone's head.

1152
01:42:28,747 --> 01:42:32,707
The probability of widespread
annihilation kept going up.

1153
01:42:32,732 --> 01:42:36,386
The only way to
stop it, was to show it.

1154
01:42:36,411 --> 01:42:37,719
To scare people straight.

1155
01:42:37,744 --> 01:42:41,481
What reasonable human
being wouldn't be galvanized

1156
01:42:41,505 --> 01:42:45,429
by the potential destruction of
everything we've ever known or loved.

1157
01:42:46,498 --> 01:42:49,116
To save civilization,

1158
01:42:49,307 --> 01:42:52,152
I would show it's collapse.

1159
01:42:52,561 --> 01:42:55,642
But how do you think this
vision was received?

1160
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:57,202
How do you think
people responded

1161
01:42:57,226 --> 01:42:59,751
to the prospect
of imminent doom?

1162
01:42:59,776 --> 01:43:03,637
They gobbled it up,
like a chocolate eclair.

1163
01:43:03,662 --> 01:43:07,346
They didn't fear their demise,
they repackaged it.

1164
01:43:07,584 --> 01:43:11,624
It can be enjoyed as video games,
as TV shows, books, movies.

1165
01:43:11,649 --> 01:43:15,113
The entire world wholeheartedly
embraced the apocalypse,

1166
01:43:15,138 --> 01:43:18,042
and sprinted towards it
with gleeful abandon.

1167
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:21,804
Meanwhile, your earth was
crumbling all around you.

1168
01:43:21,829 --> 01:43:25,905
You got simultaneous epidemics
of obesity and starvation.

1169
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:27,836
Explain that one.

1170
01:43:28,075 --> 01:43:30,832
Bees and butterflies
start to disappear.

1171
01:43:30,857 --> 01:43:32,597
The glaciers melt.

1172
01:43:32,622 --> 01:43:34,202
Algae blooms.

1173
01:43:34,227 --> 01:43:37,621
All around you. The coal mine
canaries are dropping dead,

1174
01:43:37,645 --> 01:43:41,119
and you won't take the hint!

1175
01:43:41,563 --> 01:43:45,041
In every moment, there is the
possibility of a better future.

1176
01:43:45,066 --> 01:43:47,009
But you people won't believe it.

1177
01:43:47,034 --> 01:43:48,265
And because you won't believe it,

1178
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:51,303
you wouldn't do what is
necessary to make it a reality.

1179
01:43:51,335 --> 01:43:53,615
So you dwell on
this so terrible future.

1180
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:56,569
You resign yourselves to it.
For one reason.

1181
01:43:56,594 --> 01:44:01,661
Because that future doesn't
ask anything of you today.

1182
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:08,328
So. Yes, you saw the iceberg,
you warn the Titanic.

1183
01:44:08,893 --> 01:44:12,416
but you all just steered for
it anyway. Full steam ahead.

1184
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:14,171
Why?

1185
01:44:14,903 --> 01:44:17,850
Because you want to sink.

1186
01:44:18,584 --> 01:44:20,821
You gave up.

1187
01:44:21,847 --> 01:44:24,103
That's not The Monitor's fault.

1188
01:44:24,128 --> 01:44:26,063
That's yours.

1189
01:44:29,790 --> 01:44:31,646
Put them through.

1190
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:37,038
Thanks for visiting, Frank.

1191
01:44:38,164 --> 01:44:40,758
It's genuinely nice
to see you again.

1192
01:44:50,234 --> 01:44:53,088
- What are you doing?
- Not giving up.

1193
01:45:09,092 --> 01:45:10,716
Look out!

1194
01:45:15,927 --> 01:45:17,780
- Get the thing!
- What thing!

1195
01:45:17,805 --> 01:45:20,736
The thing I gave you
when we first got here.

1196
01:45:22,655 --> 01:45:24,426
Arm it!

1197
01:45:31,748 --> 01:45:34,900
Casey, the bomb!

1198
01:45:55,297 --> 01:45:56,855
- NOW WHAT !?
- Arm it!

1199
01:45:56,879 --> 01:45:58,487
HOW !?

1200
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:26,897
Casey!

1201
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:34,477
The bomb?
Where's the bomb?

1202
01:47:54,578 --> 01:47:57,305
<font color="#ff80ff">1 minute to detonation.</font>

1203
01:48:00,956 --> 01:48:03,447
- <font color="#ff80ff">45 seconds.</font>
- Athena!

1204
01:48:03,472 --> 01:48:05,500
Bomb. What do I do?
How do I turn it off?

1205
01:48:05,525 --> 01:48:06,934
<font color="#ff80ff">30 seconds.</font>

1206
01:48:06,959 --> 01:48:08,716
You can't.

1207
01:48:10,487 --> 01:48:11,836
Ha-ha-ha...

1208
01:48:11,861 --> 01:48:14,486
This is not 
funny.

1209
01:48:17,067 --> 01:48:20,172
Frank, get out of there!
It's gonna blow!

1210
01:48:20,953 --> 01:48:23,321
GET OUT...!

1211
01:48:25,146 --> 01:48:27,311
Get out of there!

1212
01:48:29,316 --> 01:48:31,316
- Close the portal!
- <font color="#ff80ff">1.</font>

1213
01:49:00,853 --> 01:49:03,008
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

1214
01:49:03,033 --> 01:49:04,346
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

1215
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:05,860
Frank!

1216
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:11,094
No.

1217
01:49:31,795 --> 01:49:34,403
- What happened? Is she okay?
- I need to get her to a repair module.

1218
01:49:34,427 --> 01:49:36,000
Frank!

1219
01:49:36,046 --> 01:49:38,350
No one's going
to repair me.

1220
01:49:38,410 --> 01:49:40,372
I'm out of time.

1221
01:49:40,397 --> 01:49:43,036
I need to tell you
something now.

1222
01:49:49,982 --> 01:49:52,018
I'm done.

1223
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:53,900
I'm shutting down.

1224
01:49:53,925 --> 01:49:55,187
I'm...

1225
01:49:55,552 --> 01:49:57,336
...shutting down.

1226
01:49:58,338 --> 01:50:00,881
I'm going to lose sync.

1227
01:50:01,553 --> 01:50:03,395
Don't look at me like that.

1228
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:06,184
I finally think it's not...

1229
01:50:06,631 --> 01:50:08,108
failure.

1230
01:50:08,133 --> 01:50:09,854
I know.

1231
01:50:10,546 --> 01:50:14,049
There are things I need to
tell you before the final

1232
01:50:14,757 --> 01:50:17,595
Before the automative
program kicks in.

1233
01:50:18,187 --> 01:50:20,306
I'm a machine.

1234
01:50:20,331 --> 01:50:22,697
I never thought
that was bad

1235
01:50:22,722 --> 01:50:25,346
until I see your face
when you found out I was.

1236
01:50:25,371 --> 01:50:27,284
I always knew.

1237
01:50:27,779 --> 01:50:29,380
No, you didn't.

1238
01:50:29,405 --> 01:50:32,506
Systems failing.
Activating last thoughts,

1239
01:50:32,531 --> 01:50:35,483
saved for 
Frank Walker.

1240
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:41,088
Log 15.
September 1965.

1241
01:50:41,113 --> 01:50:45,857
Frank Walker is looking at me in a
manner that is difficult to recognize.

1242
01:50:46,137 --> 01:50:49,744
It seems imperative to explain to
him that I'm an Audio Animatronic.

1243
01:50:49,769 --> 01:50:51,148
Athena.

1244
01:50:51,173 --> 01:50:54,645
But I'm concerned that he
may be adversely affected,

1245
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:57,856
when he finds out
that I'm not human.

1246
01:50:58,132 --> 01:51:01,767
He has potential.
I don't want to damage it.

1247
01:51:02,005 --> 01:51:04,654
He needs someone
to believe in him.

1248
01:51:04,679 --> 01:51:07,319
And I'm fulfilling that need.

1249
01:51:07,344 --> 01:51:09,799
He's my top recruit.

1250
01:51:11,194 --> 01:51:16,418
Log 24.
October 1965.

1251
01:51:16,924 --> 01:51:20,125
I'm having unusual thoughts
towards Frank Walker.

1252
01:51:20,150 --> 01:51:23,398
I suspect a flaw in
my empathy interface.

1253
01:51:23,423 --> 01:51:25,730
I'm thinking I
should report it.

1254
01:51:27,464 --> 01:51:29,392
But I haven't.

1255
01:51:29,513 --> 01:51:32,022
I cannot explain why.

1256
01:51:32,584 --> 01:51:37,469
Log 78.
April 1984.

1257
01:51:37,494 --> 01:51:40,555
Frank Walker has been
banished by Governor Nix.

1258
01:51:40,580 --> 01:51:42,418
He says he's lost hope.

1259
01:51:42,443 --> 01:51:46,633
And he holds me responsible for
having given it to him in the first place.

1260
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:48,932
I do not understand this.

1261
01:51:48,957 --> 01:51:51,226
He says I never will.

1262
01:51:51,251 --> 01:51:56,075
Because I do not feel
anger, or disappointment

1263
01:51:58,068 --> 01:51:59,661
...or love.

1264
01:52:01,661 --> 01:52:03,922
End recording.

1265
01:52:06,407 --> 01:52:09,895
I was designed to find dreamers.

1266
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:11,947
I found you.

1267
01:52:14,388 --> 01:52:16,302
I lost you.

1268
01:52:17,916 --> 01:52:19,970
Until I found her.

1269
01:52:20,749 --> 01:52:22,404
Casey.

1270
01:52:24,902 --> 01:52:29,141
Dreamers need to
stick together.

1271
01:52:31,184 --> 01:52:33,322
It's not programming.

1272
01:52:33,797 --> 01:52:35,685
It's personal.

1273
01:52:42,819 --> 01:52:45,532
The Monitor. 
The bomb is gone.

1274
01:52:45,557 --> 01:52:48,272
But I'm not....
yet.

1275
01:52:48,297 --> 01:52:50,034
There isn't much time.

1276
01:52:50,059 --> 01:52:53,186
My self-destruct. 
Use it.

1277
01:52:53,211 --> 01:52:56,240
You know what to do, Frank.

1278
01:52:56,265 --> 01:52:59,519
How to get this right, this time.

1279
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:04,388
I thought you can't have ideas?

1280
01:53:04,413 --> 01:53:08,138
W-Well.
W-What do you know.

1281
01:53:10,781 --> 01:53:12,618
What do you know.

1282
01:53:14,859 --> 01:53:17,505
Systems failing.

1283
01:53:58,364 --> 01:54:00,983
- Frank.
- Yeah.

1284
01:54:01,905 --> 01:54:05,323
Do-Do you want to know why you
couldn't have make me laugh?

1285
01:54:07,579 --> 01:54:09,019
Why?

1286
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:12,093
Because you're not funny.

1287
01:54:23,932 --> 01:54:26,199
You can let me go now.

1288
01:54:32,868 --> 01:54:34,992
Goodbye, Frank.

1289
01:54:43,275 --> 01:54:45,266
Goodbye, Athena.

1290
01:55:15,028 --> 01:55:17,268
Oh, bollocks.

1291
01:56:07,939 --> 01:56:09,623
Now, what?

1292
01:56:10,619 --> 01:56:12,799
You're asking me?

1293
01:56:12,824 --> 01:56:14,820
This was your idea, kid.

1294
01:56:16,674 --> 01:56:18,376
Yeah.

1295
01:56:21,393 --> 01:56:23,283
You think it'll work?

1296
01:56:24,677 --> 01:56:27,194
I guess we have
to make it work.

1297
01:56:42,504 --> 01:56:44,941
So, we're making it work.

1298
01:56:45,528 --> 01:56:47,831
First order of business.

1299
01:56:48,199 --> 01:56:50,406
Get the door back open.

1300
01:56:54,671 --> 01:56:58,378
Couldn't hurt to get a few
experienced engineers over here.

1301
01:57:03,151 --> 01:57:06,968
- Next?
- Put the party back on.

1302
01:57:08,673 --> 01:57:11,820
And print out some 
new invitations.

1303
01:57:13,633 --> 01:57:17,053
Which brings us to 
why we're here today.

1304
01:57:17,078 --> 01:57:19,969
A year ago it was all
supposed to be over.

1305
01:57:19,994 --> 01:57:22,094
We shouldn't even be here.

1306
01:57:22,119 --> 01:57:23,702
But we are.

1307
01:57:24,877 --> 01:57:28,446
It isn't hard to knock
down a big, evil building

1308
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:31,461
that's telling everybody
that the world's gonna end.

1309
01:57:32,354 --> 01:57:34,141
What is hard...

1310
01:57:35,174 --> 01:57:38,061
Is figuring out what
to build in it's place.

1311
01:57:38,888 --> 01:57:41,053
If we're gonna do that,

1312
01:57:41,078 --> 01:57:43,139
we can't do it alone.

1313
01:57:43,715 --> 01:57:45,680
We need all of you.

1314
01:57:47,418 --> 01:57:50,401
Frank Walker. 
May I ask a question?

1315
01:57:50,426 --> 01:57:53,238
- Sure.
- The search parameters you've given us,

1316
01:57:53,263 --> 01:57:56,628
while mathematically sound,
are a bit...

1317
01:57:57,081 --> 01:57:59,142
undefined.

1318
01:57:59,167 --> 01:58:01,746
Could you be more specific, please?

1319
01:58:01,771 --> 01:58:03,854
Well, Miss Newton?

1320
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:07,492
You wanna tell our new recruiters
what they're looking for?

1321
01:58:07,517 --> 01:58:09,335
Dreamers.

1322
01:58:09,468 --> 01:58:11,639
We are looking,

1323
01:58:11,807 --> 01:58:13,977
for dreamers.

1324
01:58:14,731 --> 01:58:17,711
Anyone who will
feed the right wolf.

1325
01:58:27,232 --> 01:58:28,669
So.

1326
01:58:28,694 --> 01:58:31,649
I once told your predecessor

1327
01:58:31,791 --> 01:58:36,431
that she was nothing but a
combination of 1s and 0s.

1328
01:58:39,329 --> 01:58:40,908
I was wrong.

1329
01:58:41,021 --> 01:58:43,454
She was much
more than that.

1330
01:58:43,612 --> 01:58:46,152
You are much
more than that, too.

1331
01:58:46,177 --> 01:58:47,412
So.

1332
01:58:47,437 --> 01:58:50,101
Go out there and do
what she would have done.

1333
01:58:50,625 --> 01:58:52,784
Find the ones who
haven't given up.

1334
01:58:53,804 --> 01:58:55,725
They're the future.

a couple of choices.

down those stairs...

00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,569
I don't know what happened.

177
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,470
They were everywhere,
I just froze.

178
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,840
It happens to all of us.

179
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,175
The first big
one's always tough.

180
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,345
But, hey,
nobody died tonight.

181
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,481
Does it get any easier?
No.

182
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,550
But after a while,
you start to realize

183
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,920
that whatever
you're going through,

184
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,490
it's 100 times worse
for that person on the gurney.

185
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:23,595
I graduated first in my class.
I never got lower than a 97 on any exam.

186
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:26,264
I know what I'm doing.

187
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:29,567
Dr. Morris, shit.
He was so pissed.

188
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:33,137
He's always pissed.
It wasn't just you.

189
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,607
Come on.

190
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,009
We'll grab drinks
after I shower.

191
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,087
What's wrong?

192
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,156
DANNI:
That's Larry's car.

193
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,159
That fucking scumbag, I knew
he was cheating on my mom.

194
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,528
Wait here.

195
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,963
VALET:
See you again, Dr. Cook.

196
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,965
LARRY:
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

197
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,401
Larry?

198
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,169
I thought you were at a
conference in Boston.

199
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:08,439
Uh... Yeah, Danni.
It finished up early.

200
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,408
So you called my mom,

201
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,244
your wife, and told her that
you're gonna stop by the Fairmont?

202
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,512
Hey! Get your hand off
of me, son of a bitch.

203
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,914
You're out of line.

204
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,028
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

205
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,038
Here you go.

206
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,575
I can't. I can't
have another shot, Abby.

207
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,412
It's so easy. Put your head
back.

208
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,953
Yes.

209
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,554
That's it.

210
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,326
Come on, let's go dance.

211
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,561
Abby!

212
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,803
(MOANING)

213
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:27,278
I wasn't sure you
were gonna wake-up.

214
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,813
(GROANING)
Where am I?

215
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,682
My apartment.

216
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,553
Jesus, really?

217
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,791
God, the last thing I remember was
downing a drink at that club.

218
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,794
How much did I drink?

219
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,468
Where did I get this?
I don't think I want to know.

220
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,771
Are you looking for these?

221
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,508
Yeah. Thank you.

222
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,256
God, I don't even remember
leaving the club last night.

223
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,259
Shit, did I ever
call Steve back?

224
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,863
Don't worry, I texted
him from your phone.

225
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,301
As you.

226
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,504
I wasn't sure if he
knew about your drinking.

227
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,209
How do you like your coffee?

228
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,678
You seem like a milk
and sugar kind of girl.

229
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,250
Here. Call in sick.

230
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,553
Spend the day with me.
We'll have so much fun.

231
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,857
Abby, it's my
first week, I can't.

232
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:50,128
It's a hospital.
People get sick all the time.

233
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,733
Sound sick.

234
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:59,137
Abby, I feel like shit,
but I'm not sick.

235
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,439
Look, I have to go.

236
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,474
Have you seen my
clothes anywhere?

237
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,910
I can't wear this to work.

238
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:10,214
Abby:<i> Danni was getting all weird.
Not a "thank you."</i>

239
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,484
<i>She was so worried
Steve might find out</i>

240
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,321
<i>that Danni got fucked
by a total stranger.</i>

241
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:23,661
<i>And she's trying so hard to
remember if she did it or not.</i>

242
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:29,700
<i>And if that's not enough, she's
wondering if I was a part of the fun.</i>

243
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,609
Here, you can have this.

244
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,811
I was gonna give
it away anyways.

245
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,447
Oh, my God,
thank you so much.

246
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:48,286
Abby:<i> Either way, she'll tell herself
the whole thing was a dream.</i>

247
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,388
<i>But I won't let her
get away with that.</i>

248
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,726
<i>No, this was no dream.</i>

249
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,364
DANNI: Could we just pretend
last night never happened?

250
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,907
How about next
time we just do, like,

251
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:14,378
lunch and
shopping or something?

252
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,681
Abby:<i> She got fucked</i>
<i>and she liked it.</i>

253
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,752
<i>She can't turn
her back on that.</i>

254
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,387
<i>I won't let her.</i>

255
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,967
Neighbor! Hey, neighbor!

256
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:39,370
Hey, haven't seen
you around much.

257
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:43,341
My schedule's been murder.
What happened to your hand?

258
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,709
Carpal tunnel.

259
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,812
Well, I hope
it's from having fun.

260
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,881
No, I mean,
not what you're thinking.

261
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,017
I worry about you
going out alone.

262
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:56,320
There's a lot of creeps out there,
and you look kind of, you know...

263
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,855
Slutty?

264
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:01,726
No, never.
But guys might get the wrong idea.

265
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:04,996
It's dangerous out there.
I see dead people all the time.

266
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:08,699
You transport
cadavers to the anatomy lab.

267
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,736
You work with
dead people, Jared.

268
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,938
Yeah, but they
weren't always dead.

269
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,706
Some of them were killed.

270
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,541
I'm just saying,
I've seen some nasty shit.

271
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:21,379
And if you need protection,
I'd be happy to accompany you.

272
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,781
You're such a gentleman.
I'll be fine.

273
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,855
You have
a good night, Jared.

274
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,925
You, too.

275
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,929
75 Rockefeller.

276
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,308
Abby:<i> I knew Danni's prick
stepfather was a psychiatrist.</i>

277
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,810
<i>I also knew he was
a fucking scumbag.</i>

278
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:57,415
<i>But I'm
a hands-on kind of girl,</i>

279
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:02,320
<i>and since I'm here, it can't hurt
to deal with some of my own shit.</i>

280
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,089
We've covered a lot of ground
for our first session.

281
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,925
What is it that gives
you so much anxiety?

282
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,094
I feel there's something
you're not telling me.

283
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,430
I'm an addict.

284
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:16,334
That's more common than you think
in the health care profession.

285
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,868
What is it that
you're addicted to?

286
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,605
Men.

287
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,975
There's nothing wrong
with desiring men at your age.

288
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:28,713
No, Doctor,
I'm not desiring men.

289
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,815
I'm addicted to them.

290
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:40,958
Abby:<i> My mommy and I loved going
to visit Daddy at his office.</i>

291
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,127
I want you to put on your
best smile for Daddy.

292
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,795
Okay, go on in.

293
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,833
ABBY:
<i>Daddy worked very hard.</i>

294
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:52,970
<i>He was very
dedicated to his practice.</i>

295
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,441
<i>He was a great
influence on me.</i>

296
00:22:57,443 --> 00:23:02,813
<i>Even now, the way I live
my life, the men I choose,</i>

297
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,683
<i>is a tribute to that man.</i>

298
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,755
It sounds like you
had a perfect family.

299
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,526
Dr. Cook.

300
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,763
Do you think
you could help me?

301
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,934
Curing addiction doesn't happen
overnight, it's a process.

302
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,537
There are sex
addiction programs

303
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:29,774
and treatment centers
that I can recommend.

304
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:32,676
And we'll continue to work
on it here in our sessions.

305
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,417
That's all the time we have.
Same time next week?

306
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,054
And if you need me sooner...

307
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,061
Here's my cell.

308
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,701
Dr. Cook.

309
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:01,105
I feel pretty confident
with you at my side.

310
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,073
I can lick this.

311
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,960
Hi, Tony.

312
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,740
Good morning!
Good morning, Doctor.

313
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:41,245
I'm fine, thanks.
I hope I don't look that tired.

314
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:42,847
I don't know,
I couldn't get to sleep.

315
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,682
Good morning, Regina.

316
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,918
I guess the paramedic
liked your storage closet

317
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,988
because somebody got flowers,
girlfriend, and it wasn't me.

318
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,891
Huh.

319
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,560
I can't remember the last
time I got some damn flowers.

320
00:24:56,562 --> 00:25:01,599
I don't know why I can't get my
husband to send me something.

321
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:05,202
I mean, I give him good sex, too.
I got a great rack.

322
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,837
No offense.

323
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,276
You are lucky I was on call.

324
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,712
Gunshot victim.
Internal bleeding.

325
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,580
We drained him,
sewed up the pulmonary lining.

326
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:17,781
But to prevent
the sack from reopening,

327
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,216
we have to keep
him immobilized.

328
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,552
I want him on Vecuronium.
Start him on 6 cc's.

329
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,053
Now, if he so much as
twitches, you let me know

330
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,755
immediately,
and we'll up his dosage.

331
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,190
Understood.
Hmm.

332
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,230
ABBY: Six cc's.

333
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,798
Sorry.

334
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,133
The Vercu?

335
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,609
Hey, Michelle.
I need 6 cc's of Vecuronium.

336
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:48,145
Okay. I'll get it for you.

337
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,282
(SIGHS)

338
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,289
Bumpy start for us, Rogers.

339
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:03,594
But I've got a feeling
you'll fit in perfectly.

340
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:04,862
Keep it up.

341
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,302
Thanks, Mel.

342
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,176
Thanks, Danni.

343
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:32,222
Abby:<i> As I watched</i>
<i>Danni's little round ass,</i>

344
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:35,292
<i>the same one that I had
eaten the night before,</i>

345
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:39,663
<i>prior to finger-fucking
her to six orgasms,</i>

346
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:45,135
<i>and when I saw those tacky $10
flowers from dickless little Steve,</i>

347
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,972
<i>I couldn't control myself.</i>

348
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:51,241
<i>Fuck him. Fuck her.</i>

349
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:56,146
<i>I'm not some fuck toy to be
played with and tossed aside.</i>

350
00:26:56,148 --> 00:27:00,184
<i>She needs me.
Whether she knows it or not.</i>

351
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,338
I'm so clumsy.

352
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,407
It's okay.
Just be careful.

353
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,876
I'll replace the vase.

354
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:28,245
It's fine. Here.

355
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,381
I'm sorry.
The flowers are beautiful.

356
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,422
Did he fuck up?

357
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,924
We just had a disagreement.

358
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,961
Do you want to talk about it?
Just us girls?

359
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,232
Steve's now
pressuring me to move in.

360
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:51,368
Don't ever let
a man pressure you.

361
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,203
He's a really good guy.

362
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,205
They all start that way.

363
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,677
How well do you know Steve?

364
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,112
We met back when
we were freshmen in college,

365
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,148
but we just started dating
a couple years ago.

366
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,918
He was really there for me
when my father passed away.

367
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,953
What happened to him?

368
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,822
Car accident.

369
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,357
Drunk driver.

370
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,259
I'm so sorry.

371
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,761
I know how you feel.

372
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:21,298
I lost my father when
I was eight years old.

373
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,005
Hold out your hand.

374
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,213
This is an extra
key to my apartment.

375
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,882
Why? What for?

376
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:42,853
If you ever need
your own space,

377
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:47,091
or you just want to get
away from Larry or Steve,

378
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,859
it's there for you.

379
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,261
Thank you.

380
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:54,832
You know, funny enough,
Larry's the reason I go home.

381
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,434
I don't want to leave him
alone with my mother.

382
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,770
Steve just
doesn't understand that.

383
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,271
I understand.

384
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,773
You want to
protect your mother.

385
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,209
Every daughter does.

386
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,001
Hi, Larry.

387
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,302
Hi.

388
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,375
I can call you Larry?
Is that okay?

389
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:13,477
I mean,
office hours are over.

390
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,179
Of course, of course.

391
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,881
Is there something wrong?

392
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,386
Can you give me a ride?
Sure.

393
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:25,022
Do you want me to call
somebody about your car?

394
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,424
No, my car is fine.

395
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:31,061
It's my addiction.

396
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,364
It's happening again.

397
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,967
We should go
somewhere and discuss this.

398
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:40,604
Yes. Yes, please.

399
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,406
Your house?

400
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:45,242
Um, no. No,
we can't go there.

401
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,110
Oh. Right.

402
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,946
Wifey.

407
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:23,113
So, you are officially
my favorite client.

408
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:26,116
I'd say we're
having a breakthrough.

409
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:28,518
There's a hotel
around the corner.

410
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,393
What's wrong with right here?

411
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:55,012
Your wife ever
tie you up, Larry?

412
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,614
No.

415
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,499
What the fuck?

416
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:20,103
Larry, I've just injected you
with 4 cc's of Vecuronium.

417
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,572
So relax.

418
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,510
Wow. That was fast.

419
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:29,947
It's already
paralyzed your arms.

420
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,382
And soon, it will make
it impossible for you

421
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:36,053
to move any other
part of your body.

422
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:40,657
And while Vecuronium is slightly
more expensive than it's competition,

423
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:44,194
it produces few
adverse side effects.

424
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,497
It simply paralyzes you.

425
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:54,104
You look so adorable
strapped in like that.

426
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:58,041
Here, allow me.

427
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,315
So, let's make
this a happy event.

428
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:14,157
Once you're gone, your wife will
inherit lots and lots of money.

429
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,260
She will never know
what a creep you were.

430
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,630
You won't get caught.

431
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:24,234

436
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:42,052
<i>The very thing for me

437
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:44,121
<i>I felt a new beginning.</i>

Shiitake mushrooms? Wow.

It's just me, Jared.

It's okay, it's okay.

I'll take care of you now.

she'd call me if she needs me.

know where else to go.

You came to the right place.

467
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:35,792
You'll stay with me.

468
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:42,933
Thanks, but I was just
on my way to Steve's.

469
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:45,769
I just really
needed to talk.

I think I'm gonna
move in with him.

471
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,274
Danni, you've
been traumatized.

472
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:55,579
Now is not the right time to
make that kind of a decision.

473
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:59,950
He cares about me.
I think he really wants to understand me.

474
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:01,952
I understand you.

Now, forget
about this Steve.

478
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:12,495
He's just some loser
you fucked in college.

You're a nurse now.
Grow up already!

Being like what?

482
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,674

Post mortem and tox came in.

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,860
I might have some
questions down the road

495
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,562

introduce myself.

This probably
isn't the best time.

Probably.

498
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,835

the day he was killed.

500
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,076
Got to roll with
the punches here.

00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:10,914
Well, if there's anything you
can think I might need to know,

502
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,982
I would
appreciate you calling me.

503

I can't think of anything
I need to tell you about him.

Well, again, I'm really
sorry for your loss.

505
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,968
Just give me a second.

506
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,710
Why were you
speaking with that cop?

507
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,783
I was a patient of Larry's.

508
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,386
He meant a lot to me.

509
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,723

00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:27,183
No, she's the killer!

693
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:30,252
It's happening right now.
You have to send somebody now.

(COMPUTER BEEPING)

696
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,806
ABBY: <i>Rachel's been looking for
a reason to 'cause trouble.</i>

697
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:55,478
<i>Sticking her smiley little face
into places it shouldn't be.</i>

698
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,182
<i>That's not the kind of things friends
do to each other, is it, Danni?</i>

00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:02,284
<i>Poor Rachel.</i>

<i>It looks like someone won't
be at work tomorrow.</i>

Oh, my God.

702
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:15,397
All right, Miss Rogers,
I think I got it.

703
00:52:15,399 --> 00:52:18,400
You'll just wait here a moment,
Detective Rogan will be with you

704
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:19,768
when he finishes
his interview.

705
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,504
He's gonna have
some questions.

706
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:23,672
If you'll excuse me, miss.

707
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:26,809
ABBY: <i>Danni called the cops on me.
Pathetic.</i>

708
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,880
<i>So I told the big,
black stud cop</i>

709
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:33,349
<i>that Danni was
a damaged little girl</i>

710
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:37,319
<i>and how much it pained me
to see her this way.</i>

711
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,788
<i>I'm not sure, but I might have
even squeezed out a tear.</i>

712

You are lucky.

713
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:57,439
Your friend's not
pressing charges.

714
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:00,943
You can't just call 911
and accuse someone of murder.

715
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:05,548
Hey, what's going on?
Are you okay?

716
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,249
I saw her raising the
needle to Rachel's neck.

717
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:08,951
Rachel Owens is fine.

718
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:10,719
She drank too much.

719
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:13,255
She was passed
out on Abby's couch.

720
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:16,692
Abby's taunting me.
She's doing this to fuck with me.

721
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:21,530
Abby Russell seems to think
you're obsessed with her.

722
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,400
Said you broke into her apartment
the night your stepfather died,

723
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:26,235
that you must have
made a copy of her key.

724
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:28,270
She gave me
a copy of her key.

725
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:30,773
Why would she
give you a key?

726
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:33,976
She suggests you wanted to
be more than just friends.

727
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:35,344
It isn't like that.

728
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:36,445
It's not like that?

729
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:37,513
What is it like? Huh?

730
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,748
Is it like this?

731
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,719
Or is it like
(EXCLAIMS) that?

732
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,422
Huh?

733
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:48,757
Here's another one.

734
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:50,559
(LAUGHS)
You guys.

735
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,895
This is my favorite one.

736
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:56,265
She says you're
obsessed with her.

737
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:58,300
She drugged me.
I ran a blood test.

738
00:53:58,302 --> 00:53:59,501
I had rufilin in my system.

739
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:00,769
Can you prove it?

740
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,910
Word of advice,
stay away from Abby Russell.

741
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:11,747
She killed my stepfather.
She told me to my face, she killed him.

742
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,849
Yeah, I read
your report. Here.

743
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,454
This word.
Can you pronounce it for me?

744
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:19,722
Vecuronium.

745
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:20,724
Huh.
Vecuronium.

746
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,626
What is that?

747
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,995
It's a paralytic drug.

748
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:30,733
Well, the autopsy report shows your
stepfather had it in his system.

749
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:34,303
Why would Larry inject himself
with a paralytic drug?

750
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,905
He wouldn't.
It paralyzes you.

751
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:38,841
Well, someone did.

752
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:41,310
My boys down in the lab,
they're never wrong.

753
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:43,445
And something
else is biting at me.

754
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:47,383
The same day your stepfather died,
you signed out the same drug.

755
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,552
How crazy is that? Huh?

756
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,557
Any reason I shouldn't be
digging up your stepfather?

757
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,031
You can go.

758
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:03,766
I can only imagine
what you're thinking.

759
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:05,834
No, you can't.

760
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:08,937
Steve, please, I'm telling the truth.
You're telling me the truth?

761
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:12,007
So, you're telling me that somebody
photoshopped those pictures up there?

762
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:14,410
And somebody else forged your
signature at the hospital.

763
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:16,779
Steve...
You think I'm stupid, Danni?

764
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:18,447
I know it looks bad.
Jesus!

765
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:20,082
It's not like that, though.
It's not like that.

766
00:55:20,084 --> 00:55:22,584
And you've been fucking
around on me with Abby.

767
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:25,654
I haven't. You know me,
I wouldn't do that.

768
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:26,889
Steve.

769
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:33,729
She's a liar, Steve. She's a fucking liar.
She made all of it up, okay?

770
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:35,531
Can't hear you.
She made it all up.

771
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:36,932
You know me.

00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,707
Man, you know, I haven't thought about
Sarah since she left here when she was 18.

781
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:26,709
Why was she here?

Could you wait outside?
Mommy and Daddy need to talk.

788
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:46,762
Yeah, go on outside, honey.

789
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:00,909
I told you never to
barge into my office.

<i>the state sent

793
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,872
So, what happened to Sarah?

794
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:32,841
Sarah was a very
complicated kid.

795
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:35,043
Kind of stuck to
herself most of the time.

796
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:36,845
Cutest thing, though.

797
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,914
You know, she used to always
walk around with this doll.

798
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:41,717
It was a nurse's doll.

799
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,589
What happened to her?

800
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:49,925
About a year later,
the mom committed suicide.

801
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:51,860
Sarah had no other family.

802
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:56,131
One of the nurses here, she
became like her guardian Angel.

803
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,568
Janet Russell.
She and Sarah were inseparable.

804
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,237
Sarah used to follow her
all around the institution.

805
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:05,707
They developed quite
the mother-daughter bond.

806
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:09,211
As a matter of fact, when Sarah was
released, she went and lived with Janet.

807
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:12,180
When Janet retired, she
just stopped coming around.

808
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:15,183
It's like she
just disappeared.

809
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:16,618
Not sure whatever
happened to Sarah.

810
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,038
Dr. Morris,
I got your message.

811
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,340
What's the issue
you want to discuss?

812
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:43,579
One of our young nurses had some
troubling things to say about you, Abby.

813
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:47,282
Well, you know I can be a
little tough on the new girls.

814
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:49,851
Well, this sounded
a bit more than tough.

815
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:52,087
I'm considering my options.

816
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,690
Either I can look into this complaint
by the sensitive young nurse,

817
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:56,658
maybe bring the matter up
before the board...

818
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,632
Or?

819
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:07,636

with an opportunity

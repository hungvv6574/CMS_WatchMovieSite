1
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,091
<i>Las Vegas.</i>

2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,881
<i>For 100 years, people have flocked
to get a taste of its forbidden fruit.</i>

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,482
<i>In the 1930s and '40s,
it was the Mafia and gambling.</i>

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,249
<i>In the late '50s, America's first topless
showgirls appeared at the Dunes Casino.</i>

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,967
<i>And in the '60s, it was all about
Frank and the Rat Pack.</i>

6
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,604
<i>But today, damn!
Vegas has become Disneyland for adults.</i>

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,763
<i>And let me tell you something.
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.</i>

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,322
<i>See, in this town,
you don't know if it's day or night.</i>

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,404
<i>And guess what? You don't care,
because you're in Vegas, baby!</i>

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,962
<i>From the casinos to the clubs,
the pools and the strip bars,</i>

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,283
<i>it's the best place in the world for
men and women to get their freak on.</i>

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,448
Okay, just be careful
because it's a wedding dress.

13
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,851
Why are you stressing? It's beautiful.

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,888
<i>Unless, of course,
they go together as couples.</i>

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,121
Zeke?

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,443
Zeke the Freak! It's me, Marty. Remember?

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,641
Marty the One Man Party!
What up? What up, man?

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,727
Oh, man, wait till I tell Luis
the Freak is back in town!

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,043
Two of my wildest nights ever
was with Z to the F.

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,651
I can only imagine.

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,486
Oh, baby, you don't even got to imagine.
We got this on video.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,561
She don't wanna see that.

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,005
- She ain't about that life?
- No.

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,084
That's sweet. This man is a god.
A legend with the ladies.

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,969
We used to get him drunk
just to get his leftovers.

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,042
I was young, I used to come by here
once in a while.

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,281
Sounds like you came here a lot.

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,605
You remember
Marco's big blow-out bash last year?

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,767
That was a few years ago.

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,684
- Them strippers was off the chain.
- Marty, this is my woman, Mya.

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,925
Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,930
No! Wait!

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,685
You took him down?

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,003
Lower the flag, baby! Retire the rubbers.

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,605
Zeke the Freak is getting married!

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,444
No! No, dude, God, no.

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,921
We just here for a friend's wedding.
Mya just made the dresses.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,411
- Designed.
- Designed the dresses.

39
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,403
Well, I'm just saying,
if you can get away later on,

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,450
Luis is having an after-party
at the Chicken Ranch...

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,567
I'm right here!

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,722
- Well, this how we do, baby!
- Let me just get with you later.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,521
All right. Get your girl in check, she gonna
make me look bad out here in the street, man.

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,448
Wait till I tell Luis the
Freak is back in town!

45
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,844
I don't know that dude, really. I met
him one time. He drives and cuts hair.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,968
- Hell, no.
- Zeke the Freak is back in town, baby!

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,326
<i>Now, my opinion?</i>

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,802
<i>The only thing worse than going to Vegas
as a couple is going as man and wife.</i>

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,291
Babe, you see the car?

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,010
Look at these hookers.

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,491
Tish, honey, those are not hookers.

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,131
They're just girls having fun in Vegas.
It's really not a big deal.

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,124
They probably got no dad in their life,
low self-esteem. It's very sad, actually.

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,720
By the way, Bennett, that fanny-pack
really screams "Vegas Weekend."

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,929
Yeah, Tish got it for me. It's safer to
keep your money in the front in Vegas.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,446
- Plus, she gave me a bonus.
- Bet she did.

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,729
And I can get to the money if I need to.
It's right in the front.

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,006
I can't wait to get to the room.

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,366
All right.

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,482
Okay, good, there's gonna be like an hour
between check-in and separation.

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,131
- For what?
- We're trying to have a baby, ASAP.

62
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,487
I waited nine years to get married,
so we're, you know.

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,326
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you!

64
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,289
- I hope for your sake it's a boy.
- Why?

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,887
Well, you know, when you have a boy,
you just worry about his wiener.

66
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,204
When you have a girl, you have to worry
about all the wieners coming at her.

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,841
Smacking her around.
You remember how it is.

68
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,242
The romance and magic of scheduled sex.

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,527
- Girl's not gonna wait forever.
- Yeah, no, I get it.

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,806
She doesn't want to be the "old" mom.

71
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,607
I can't believe it, man! You as a father.

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,648
I know, right? I can't believe it either.

73
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,962
She's like a drill sergeant, on a schedule!

74
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,326
It's like there's a shot clock,

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,482
constantly winding down to one,
and I gotta hit the last shot.

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,284
Last week, I thought I sprained it.

77
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,921
You know, the worst part about it is
I had to stop smoking pot.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,002
- No! You? Pot.
- Yeah. Me.

79
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,809
- It's like saying goodbye to an old friend.
- Why?

80
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,451
Because I can only deal with
one stoned child at a time, that's why.

81
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,761
- She heard us.
- She hears everything.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,449
<i>Fortunately, some couples know exactly
how to embrace the true spirit of Vegas.</i>

83
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,051
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,488
<i>So they hadn't seen each other for 10 days
because of Lauren's business trip.</i>

85
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,561
<i>Now you know what they say.</i>

86
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,087
<i>Absence does make the heart
and other organs grow fonder.</i>

87
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,401
<i>Despite its reputation as Sin City,</i>

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,051
<i>Vegas is still the number one
destination in the country</i>

89
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,806
<i>for couples to do the craziest thing
of all, get married. Dummies.</i>

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,002
It is the perfect setting.

91
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,970
Everything is perfect.
You know, this kind of looks like...

92
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,201
Ancient Rome, like <i>Spartacus.</i>

93
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,647
Excuse me, when have you seen <i>Spartacus?</i>

94
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,087
At Grandma's, when she falls asleep
during <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,208
I do not fall asleep when
I'm babysitting you!

96
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,250
So, Candace, the bride
will enter from here,

97
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,448
and right there is where...

98
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,046
We get married.

99
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,921
So, remember, you must be here on time
so we can begin your ceremony promptly.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,048
- We cannot hold up the next wedding party.
- Yes.

101
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,766
Perfect timing!
Your wedding programs just arrived.

102
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,841
I've got that.

103
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,322
It was so sweet of your mom
to splurge on French linen paper.

104
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,450
Candace, you are the only daughter
she's ever gonna have.

105
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,251
And I think this whole process
has really been healing for her.

106
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,244
Especially after the passing
of Deacon Johnson.

107
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,084
Aunt Winnie said he died in bed
with Miss Loretta.

108
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,367
But at least he had a happy ending.

109
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,441
There you go.

110
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,124
Thank you.

111
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,927
- What?
- What?

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,287
"Michael and Tandis"?

113
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,805
Seriously?

114
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,961
No, no, no!

115
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,610
Oh, baby. They probably misheard her.

116
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,968
Do not have a mama's boy relapse
on our wedding weekend.

117
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,089
No. Baby, I'm gonna give you
the perfect wedding. All right?

118
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,446
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

119
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,286
<i>I arrived the only way a sane person
should for a weekend in Vegas.</i>

120
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,964
<i>I'm talking about solo, people!</i>

121
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,321
<i>After Gail pissed on my iPad for no reason,</i>

122
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,882
<i>our marriage counselor suggested that
we have a trial separation for one month.</i>

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,169
<i>Which meant I was free to do
whatever I wanted, starting right now.</i>

124
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,004
- How you doin'?
- Doing very well, sir, thank you.

125
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,163
Name is Ward. Cedric Ward.
I'm staying in the...

126
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,686
Constantine Villa. Welcome, Mr. Ward.
We've been expecting you.

127
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,246
Your dedicated concierge
is awaiting you inside.

128
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,926
Listen, I'm gonna need you to
dedicate yourself to something.

129
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,287
See this car right here? It's a rental.

130
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,370
And I passed on the insurance 'cause
they wanted me to pay the extra five.

131
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,681
I'm not talking about dollars,
I'm talking about hundred.

132
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,250
So I need you to watch this car like

133
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,810
your life depended on it.
Can you do that for me?

134
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,249
Welcome to Caesar's Palace, Mr. Ward.

135
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,606
Well, hello!

136
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,046
- Hello.
- Hi.

137
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,570
This is what I'm talkin' about!

138
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,642
Welcome to Caesar's Palace, Mr. Ward.

139
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,082
I'm Vanessa, here to accommodate
your every need during your stay with us.

140
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,128
Well, I got a lotta needs,
so let's get to accommodatin'.

141
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,207
I understand you're part of
the Hanover-Hall wedding party.

142
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,725
You're looking at the best man.

143
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,801
I'ma hook it up.

144
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,885
In my opinion, the Constantine Villa is the
most elegant suite in the entire hotel.

145
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,325
Were they able to put
the stripper pole in the room?

146
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,570
I'm doing a little after-party at the
bachelor party, like an after-after-party?

147
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,404
- Unfortunately not.
- Damn it.

148
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,450
But your personal butler Declan
can take care of your other needs.

149
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,887
My personal butler? I
didn't pay for no butler.

150
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,166
It's on the house.

151
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,970
Well, I like this house!

152
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,282
- We aim to please.
- Well, you have succeeded!

153
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,362
Just sign here for
your balance and incidentals.

154
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,920
I'll take you upstairs for
a personal tour of your villa.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,401
Private tour? Okay.
This is pretty standard, right?

156
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,721
- You should read it.
- Nah, it'll say the same stuff.

157
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,086
Been to one hotel, been to them all.

158
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

159
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,484
I'm waiting on you.

160
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,640
Vanessa!

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,245
Cedric! What up, man?

162
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,401
Zeeky! What's up?

163
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,090
- Wait a minute.
- Hey, Mya.

164
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,810
Hold on, hold on. Let me get this right.

165
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,406
Gail let you leave the house
and come to Vegas by yourself?

166
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,447
Don't you start with me, Zeke.

167
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,363
You lyin', I know she here.
Gail, where you at?

168
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,441
Zeke, look at me right now.

169
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,010
- You look amazing.
- It looks good, right?

170
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,730
It's H&M. Men's line.

171
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,521
Hey. I want to introduce you
to my new friend, Vanessa.

172
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,607
Zeke the Freak?

173
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,727
Vanessa...

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,847
You son of a bitch!

175
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,923
- What the hell?
- What are you doing?

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,287
- Where's my passport?
- I don't have your damn passport!

177
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,327
Why did you do that?

178
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,210
- Zeke, I thought she was gonna drink it.
- Excuse me, excuse me!

179
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,887
Miss Martinez, I am shocked and appalled.
In my office, immediately.

180
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,961
Man, chill out.

181
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,204
Watch your back.

182
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,485
Thank you, Zeke.
'Cause I had that in the bag.

183
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,800
That was about to get booked.

184
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,245
She was supposed to give me a tour, sir.

185
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,761
I will give you your personalized,
private tour of the villa.

186
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,525
Well, I don't wanna be rude,
but you can keep that shit.

187
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,045
I want Vanessa, I don't need your tour.

188
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,488
Sir, look at my face. I'm in the
Constantine. The Constantine...

189
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,846
- Constantine.
- Constantine.

190
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,490
I can't talk to you right now.

191
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,881
Are you okay?
Your baggage is gonna catch up to you, man.

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,081
Mya, are you all right?

193
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,923
You gotta be strong. I get it.
Did she go this way? Vanessa!

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,001
Cedric!

195
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,689
- See you later.
- All right.

196
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,127
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you, nice to meet you.

197
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,010
<i>The whole crew was back together.</i>

198
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,320
<i>Without even realizing it,</i>

199
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,007
<i>the men and the women had
divided themselves into opposing teams.</i>

200
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,527
Look! We both got on green shirts
and we both got blue eyes!

201
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,090
<i>It was a sign of things to come.</i>

202
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,525
- Let's go get a drink, man.
- Please.

203
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,364
You can really clear a room out, Bennett.

204
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,205
- Tell me, what are we doing tonight?
- No, no, no!

205
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,691
I want to go see <i>Jersey Boys.</i>

206
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,047
We're not going to see
no damn <i>Jersey Boys,</i> Bennett.

207
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,451
- Why not?
- What do you mean, "Why not?"

208
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,841
Because we're men.
We're at a bachelor party in Vegas.

209
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,042
We're here to make bad decisions
and regret them the next day.

210
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,485
Story of your life, right, Zeke?

211
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,050
I say we take a vote.

212
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,360
Bennett, we're not taking no vote.

213
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,169
Okay, you know what?
I wanna talk to everybody.

214
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,044
Before we all start power-trippin', okay?

215
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,804
Understand that Michael had the opportunity

216
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,723
to choose anybody standing here
to be his best man.

217
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,370
I want you all to remember
that he chose me.

218
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,124
You know why?
'Cause I'm the best man with a plan.

219
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,885
I didn't want to drop that ball on y'all,
but y'all didn't leave me a choice.

220
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,121
Now I'm the bad guy.

221
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,125
So, I've been giving this a lot of thought.
I want you to be my best man.

222
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,408
- Me?
- No, Ced, actually, I was talking to Do...

223
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,767
No, listen, don't say
nothin' right now, man.

224
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,730
Like, I knew you and I had a connection,
but this is crazy!

225
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,690
Let me tell you something, this means
so much to me. I'm not gonna let you down.

226
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,082
Let me tell you something, I'm gonna be the
best best man in the history of all best men.

227
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,925
I've always wanted to be a best man,
and you want to give me that opportunity?

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,685
We came here to golf,
and now you gonna give me this blessing?

229
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,162
I gotta go to the bathroom, Dom!

230
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,681
<i>This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine</i>

231
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,490
You made the right choice.

232
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,925
All right, couples, listen up!

233
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,326
Come on, put a little pep in your step.

234
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,883
Listen up, people. You got exactly one hour

235
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,327
to go settle into your room
and say your goodbyes!

236
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,682
'Cause for the next 24 hours,
the boys are gonna be with the boys...

237
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,444
And the girls with the girls.

238
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,965
Tomorrow, you can all go back to

239
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,691
that miserable and sexless existence
that is marriage.

240
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,569
- No offense, Mike.
- You don't gotta worry about us.

241
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,643
We gonna be happy and sexy.

242
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,928
Well, you better treasure that. Okay.

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,207
What? Gail? No! Not now.

244
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,407
Let me tell you something, Mike.

245
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,324
Truth is, Gail and I were both happy
and sexy for 22 years.

246
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,606
See? There you go.

247
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,045
Then we met each other.

248
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,925
That ship sailed. Like the <i>Titanic...</i>

249
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,365
Come on, baby, we only got an hour.

250
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,090
Before you all go, listen to me.

251
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,161
- Real quick, guys.
- So weird.

252
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,208
Let's discuss meeting points.

253
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,442
<i>The teams were chosen,
the players were ready,</i>

254
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,363
<i>and it was time for the pre-game warm-up.</i>

255
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,204
Everybody else to their room.
I don't know where mine is.

256
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,209
<i>In basketball, you have to know
what kinda offense you runnin'.</i>

257
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,768
<i>But no matter what it is,
the goal is to outscore your opponent.</i>

258
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,601
<i>The Constantine Villa,
all 12,000 square feet of it.</i>

259
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,810
<i>The ultimate bachelor party pad.
Yeah. I had definitely scored first.</i>

260
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,405
- Your key, sir.
- Right, right.

261
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,164
If there's anything else you need,

262
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,651
your personal butler Declan
is here to serve you.

263
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,801
Okay.

264
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,486
- Well, thank you, Marcel Heffer.
- Haffer.

265
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,326
Haffer.

266
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,648
"Marcel" will work just fine, thank you.

267
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,286
I'll call you Marc. Thank you.

268
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,321
Declan!

269
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,802
Morning, sir. I trust everything
is up to your standards, sir.

270
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,526
Now, I understand that you made an inquiry

271
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,241
about making some structural changes
to your suite, Mr. Ward.

272
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,242
You got the poles! Yes!

273
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,446
A certain member of a certain royal family
left more behind than just memories.

274
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,760
Yes, you can almost smell
the aristocratic DNA from here.

275
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,326
I don't know what that means.

276
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,090
It doesn't matter.

277
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,400
Now, I shall be next door.

278
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,484
So if you need anything,
just press number one on your keypad.

279
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,086
Right.

280
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,208
Hey, hey, hey.
Let me tip you, man.

281
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,441
- No, sir, I couldn't...
- Please, stop.

282
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,126
- People don't think black people tip.
- I do this for the love of the job...

283
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,804
Well, thank you very much, sir,
that would be lovely.

284
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,406
I wasn't gonna give it all to you.
I'll give you a certain amount, sir...

285
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,721
- Thank you, sir.
- No, thank you!

286
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,122
No, the 10%... Okay, you're welcome.

287
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,486
You gone?

288
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,451
Oh, shit!

289
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,405
What's that?

290
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,482
That's a big-ass table!

291
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,241
<i>The race was on.</i>

292
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,800
<i>No matter what Lauren had planned
for the bachelorette party,</i>

293
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,564
<i>it didn't matter,
'cause she was already behind.</i>

294
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,041
Declan, can you get that smell out of here?

295
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,965
Babe, we got a really
great view of the Strip.

296
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,685
Come on, we don't have much time.

297
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,171
- Let's go.
- All right.

298
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,681
Hang on, let me get these...

299
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,250
I want three good shots
before we go out tonight.

300
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,890
- Three?
- Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,008
My belt is stuck. Help me.
Your hands are cold.

302
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,010
Yeah, no, no.

303
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,127
That's never happened before.

304
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,925
Yeah, I just need a minute. Gotta reload.

305
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,680
- Is it me?
- No, no. I just need a second.

306
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,887
- You know what we need?
- What?

307
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,927
Role play.

308
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,201
- Role play?
- Yeah.

309
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,401
Okay.

310
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,289
- What, you brought stuff?
- Yeah, I came prepared, babe.

311
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,521
What's this?

312
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,960
This is <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

313
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,087
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

314
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,648
I am Daenerys,

315
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,001
the virgin princess of dragon blood.

316
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,371
And you, you are Khal Drogo,
my fierce nomadic king.

317
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,967
Take me, you barbarian! Take me!

318
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,441
Babe, babe, babe.
I just need a second, okay?

319
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,525
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

320
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,965
I need to get stoned.

321
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,609
Don't tell me
you brought pot through the airport.

322
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,684
Not pot. Pot strips.

323
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,240
Breath strips as far as
airport security is concerned.

324
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,970
Kills germs that cause bad breath

325
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,445
and is the equivalent of
three great bong hits.

326
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,488
- It's a great product.
- Jeremy, we talked about this.

327
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,404
We're in Vegas, Kris, for a party weekend.

328
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,403
You remember what it's like
to chill out and have fun, right?

329
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,481
You don't think I'm fun?

330
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,006
You're like Louis Gossett, Jr.
in <i>An Officer And A Gentleman.</i>

331
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,606
- I'm sorry, I didn't wanna say it.
- Please. This is fun.

332
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,762
- It's wild!
- Come on.

333
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,320
For your information, me and the girls
are gonna get our freak on tonight.

334
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,961
With Lauren in charge.
What, is she gonna enroll you in a 401 K?

335
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,167
You know what?

336
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,289
Daenerys, you actually
need that more than I do.

337
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,046
<i>Now, by being the groom,
Michael figured that</i>

338
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,851
<i>it couldn't be any easier
than an uncontested lay-up.</i>

339
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,048
- Do you hear that?
- What?

340
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,770
Silence.

341
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,080
I think we're finally alone.

342
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,084
Imagine that.

343
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,645
Michael, careful.

344
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,649
I can't believe how much of a klutz I am.

345
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,200
Come here. Let me help you take this off.
I have to. You're wet.

346
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,808
We have not had sex in 90 days.
So tomorrow night can be special.

347
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,963
No, I am not caving now.

348
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,208
Maybe I am caving a little.

349
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,491
Ma!

350
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,881
Oh, my goodness, Loretta!

351
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,611
Sorry, sorry. Didn't know you were here.

352
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,841
Of course she's here.

353
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,288
Your Uncle Tony sends his regrets.

354
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,209
- Where did she come from?
- I have no idea.

355
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,086
But while I have you, I'd like for you
to sign off on the centerpieces.

356
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,525
Yes.

357
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,090
Well, they're stunning,

358
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,081
but those are peach roses
and I wanted white.

359
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,003
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, I know.

360
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,731
But Fernando thought, you know,

361
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,488
this being your second wedding and all,
perhaps white was not appropriate.

362
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,804
We could always go darker.
Lavender, brick. Brick is good.

363
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,169
Mom. We discussed this, okay?
This is not Fernando's wedding.

364
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,403
This is Candace's wedding
and she would like white roses.

365
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,286
All right, all right. To hell with
what's appropriate and respectable.

366
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,725
I'll call Fernando right now
and just forget I was ever here.

367
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,361
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,525
Are you in the adjoining suite?

369
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,841
Yes. What a coincidence.

370
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,361
It is.

371
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,565
Come on now. Don't worry.

372
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,008
Once the door closes
you can barely hear a thing.

373
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,081
Ta!

374
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,601
Did you know that
she was in the adjoining suite?

375
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,125
Of course not. No.

376
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,362
Don't you think that's
a little Norman Bates

377
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,125
to have your mother
sleeping in the next room?

378
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,043
- On our wedding night?
- Yes, yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,406
The doors are soundproof,

380
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,802
and I'm sure she's gonna respect
our wishes and our privacy, so...

381
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,881
Okay.

382
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,888
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

383
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,441
Forgot my cell phone.

384
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,960
Proceed.

385
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,240
Norman Bates, my ass.

386
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,447
<i>Damn! That was like being blocked
from behind by LeBron.</i>

387
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,007
<i>It's called pre-game jitters, people.
Happens to the best of us.</i>

388
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,845
<i>Michael's been bitched,
and Jeremy's shot was flat.</i>

389
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,729
<i>Now it was time to see how Zeke was doing.</i>

390
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,251
Is it steamy in here, or is it just you?

391
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,321
It's just me.

392
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,525
Okay.

393
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,800
What do you think?

394
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,325
- Zeke!
- It's nice.

395
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,447
It's nice?

396
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,406
No, that is beautiful.
I didn't expect it to look that expensive.

397
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,164
You didn't expect it to
look this expensive?

398
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,961
No, you're a fashion genius.
What do you want me to say? I love it.

399
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,691
- Babe, can't the hotel do that for you?
- No.

400
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,888
Look at this Grecian tub.
Let me fix you a bath.

401
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,803
We got enough time for two quickies.

402
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,565
Stop. Stop. Not in the mood.
Not in the mood. Okay?

403
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,723
Besides, I'd like to be the one woman
you haven't slept with in Vegas.

404
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,006
Really? Wait. Hold up.

405
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,491
Mya.

406
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,608
I slept with one woman.

407
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,046
You know, counting is so damn high school.

408
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,122
We all have a past.
It's not like I lied about mine.

409
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,725
Yeah, but you definitely downplayed it.

410
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,371
Who doesn't downplay?
You downplayed your fling with Kanye.

411
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,361
That's not the point.

412
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,286
All I'm saying is that I don't think it's fair
that my past is an issue and yours is not.

413
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,647
What I'm saying is that I feel...

414
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,045
I don't feel like you're being...
I don't feel like your letting me in.

415
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,930
How am I not letting you in?
I'm trying to let you in right now!

416
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,241
I'm saying you're giving me half-truths,
not telling me everything.

417
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,890
- Ask me what you wanna know.
- Anything?

418
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,246
I'll tell you whatever you wanna know.

419
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,644
I wanna know what you guys are doing
for the bachelor party tonight.

420
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,366
You know, it's nothing extravagant
because it's not in the budget.

421
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,010
It's just a night out with the guys.

422
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,966
Get a steak dinner, maybe some gambling.

423
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,691
And hit a couple clubs.

424
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,445
See? I just told you
and you don't believe me.

425
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,567
You?

426
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,526
Or "Zeke the Freak"?

427
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,484
<i>Damn! Rejected.</i>

428
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,007
Hey!

429
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,127
That was masculine.

430
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,441
Relax. You haven't got anything
I haven't seen already

431
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,364
in a much, much larger size.

432
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,171
You know, the air comes in low, right...

433
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,446
Hey, Miss Loretta.

434
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,683
Welcome to the Constantine Villa.

435
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,285
Are you ready for the tour?

436
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,328
- Are you ready to be slapped?
- No, ma'am.

437
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,800
I don't want that.

438
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,206
Now listen very carefully.

439
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,326
I've got a list of the dos and don'ts
for Michael's bachelor party tonight.

440
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,607
I don't think we need a list...

441
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,530
My Michael is a good Christian boy.

442
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,605
He's always been a good Christian boy.

443
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,164
Some stuff... He has.

444
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,130
And I want him to still be
a good Christian boy

445
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,964
when he gets married tomorrow.

446
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,326
- Are we clear?
- Yes.

447
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,004
Are we clear, short man?

448
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,084
No, we... I'm seeing through what you said.
That's how clear it is.

449
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,841
Thank you.

450
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,367
And put some clothes on.
There's nothing attractive about that.

451
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,601
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,526
Miss Loretta, you didn't have
a key, did you? You just...

453
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,970
She got ass.

454
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,362
<i>Well, with the warm-ups
looking pretty bleak,</i>

455
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,488
<i>we had to turn to
the one member of our team that</i>

456
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,005
<i>we could always count on to score.</i>

457
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,764
So, how are you?

458
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,730
Good. Great, actually.

459
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,088
Subscriptions are up 11%
since the Michelle Obama issue,

460
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,801
- and I just closed this amazing deal...
- Baby, baby.

461
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,962
- Yeah?
- How are you?

462
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,445
Better now.

463
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,244
- Wait. I totally forgot to ask.
- What?

464
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,890
How was it catering the TED talk?

465
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,371
They asked me back for next year.

466
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,885
- Really?
- And the best part.

467
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,566
Chef Cotillard told me I had a gift.

468
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,248
In fact, he's making me and the guys
a special tasting menu just for us.

469
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,163
I am so proud of you.

470
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,241
Thank you.

471
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,606
Don't get it.

472
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,762
- No, I'm just gonna see who it is.
- No, don't get it.

473
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,047
Oh, my God. I have to get it.
It's Lee Fox. CEO! Lauren.

474
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,766
<i>Lauren, it's Lee.</i>

475
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,047
Listen, a position's opened up
at the parent company.

476
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,281
<i>I think you'd be perfect for it.</i>

477
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,521
Grabbing a shower.

478
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,607
For what?

479
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,242
COO of our Global Media Group.
Are you interested?

480
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,249
Are you kidding me? Absolutely.

481
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,448
Great, I got a meeting with
the board of directors this afternoon.

482
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,411
Things could move fast. I need you settled
in New York by the first of the month.

483
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,162
Wait, New York?

484
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,529
That is where
our headquarters are located, Lauren.

485
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,206
I got a good feeling about this. Now go.

486
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,201
I did, too.

487
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,811
You look beautiful in that light.

488
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,001
How'd it go?

489
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,927
It went good. Great, actually.

490
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,049
- Dominic, we need to talk...
- Housekeeping!

491
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,645
The guys are here.

492
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,801
- Yeah.
- Hello.

493
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,881
And you know what? You should get that.

494
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,201
- No, they can wait.
- No, they'll get us put out.

495
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,890
- They're so loud.
- That's true.

496
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,411
- All right, I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

497
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,960
Come on, Homeo and Do-me-yet!

498
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,890
- Open up the door, Dom.
- Yo, yo, yo, yo.

499
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
- Button up. I'm insecure enough as it is.
- It's a little early.

500
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,403
- Let's go.
- Give me a sec. Give me a sec.

501
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,088
What up, Lauren? You look good, girl.
What kind of lotion you wearing?

502
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,241
You been on the treadmill?

503
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,322
So, I gotta go.

504
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,686
Okay.

505
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,922
- Is everything all right?
- Hurry up, man.

506
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,241
Yeah.

507
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,845
Hasn't this part burned out yet?

508
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,161
You guys still all like
each other and stuff?

509
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,481
God, I just love you so much.

510
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,925
Damn! Come on, boy.

511
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,764
I love you too, babe.

512
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,003
- Get a room!
- We're in it!

513
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,764
Well, stop.

514
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,570
- Behave.
- I'll be good.

515
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,641
Okay, please.

516
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,485
Hey, Lauren. Your afterglow is amazing.

517
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,001
Move.

518
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,281
He was killing that.

519
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,401
Shit.

520
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,610
<i>So, even though we were
a little confused on how to score,</i>

521
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,205
<i>it was time for the first quarter tip-off.</i>

522
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,408
Your guests are here, sir.

523
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,686
There they go!

524
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,211
Welcome to my crib, gentlemen.

525
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,568
Damn, C, I knew you had a good year,
but how big was your bonus, man?

526
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,364
Dom, you only get to be best man once.

527
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,410
Besides, I got a great deal. Real good
deal. I'm paying four grand a night.

528
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,806
- What?
- For all this?

529
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,689
- It's gotta be at least 10.
- No, it's not.

530
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,205
You sure you don't need us
to chip in for this?

531
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,362
Silence! Don't insult me like that.

532
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,529
Guys, he says he's good. Let him treat us.

533
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,207
Listen, me being here with my best friends,
that makes it worth every penny.

534
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,520
Every damn penny.

535
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,648
Ced, put some clothes on, man.

536
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,484
You guys want some drinks?

537
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,971
- I'll have a drink.
- That's the only reason I'm here.

538
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,084
Okay. Declan, let's do that.

539
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,841
I'm sorry, sir.

540
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,368
I thought you were trying
to turn the lights on.

541
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,407
No.

542
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,881
All right, gentlemen,
let's get these glasses up in the air.

543
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,769
To a night that we will never forget.

544
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,683
You guys realize
this is the first time in three months

545
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,921
we've been together for even a drink?

546
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,081
Sad, what happened to us?

547
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,400
- Work, man.
- Nah, relationships.

548
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,686
- Weddings.
- Kids.

549
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,125
Fellas, that's why
we need to embrace this moment,

550
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,771
because for one blissful night, gentlemen,

551
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,968
we are free from all of our obligations.

552
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,041
Preach on.

553
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,929
From all of our responsibilities,
and we're definitely...

554
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,042
We're free from our women. How about that?

555
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,770
- Look, mine's down.
- This is Zeke.

556
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,888
<i>Zeke, let me talk to Cedric.
It's important.</i>

557
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,850
You picked the right best man.
He knows it. You know it, too.

558
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,921
- It's Gail.
- What?

559
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,280
- She says it's important.
- Tell her I'm busy.

560
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,124
- She knows I'm with you.
- So, why you pick up the phone?

561
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,611
- Because it was a private number.
- Lower your voice.

562
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,125
- Lower your voice.
- It was a private number.

563
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,009
You don't answer private numbers.
Give me the phone, man.

564
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,924
- We expecting strippers to call.
- Just give me the phone.

565
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,490
<i>- Listen, you drunk Muppet.</i>
- Gail.

566
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,767
<i>I tried to use my credit card.
It was declined.</i>

567
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,729
- Declined? What are you talking about?
<i>- You heard me.</i>

568
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,962
<i>If I was there, I'd kick
you in your throat.</i>

569
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,610
I may have went over the
limit a little bit.

570
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,681
<i>How much, Cedric?</i>

571
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,604
Gail, listen to me.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime type thing.

572
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,091
<i>- I'm gonna kill you!</i>
- Okay, this...

573
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,925
Hello?

574
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,601
Gail?

575
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,801
Declined?

576
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,043
Here you go, sir.
This should make you feel a little better.

577
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,443
Thank you, Declan.
I'm serious, I needed that right now.

578
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,808
This is so refreshing to finally live
with someone who understands me.

579
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,965
Likewise, sir. I think we're like
soul brothers from different mothers.

580
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,410
I don't think that's it, but...

581
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,010
- I'll have some more.
- So what's the plan, Ced?

582
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,731
See those flyers right there?
I made those up for the after-party.

583
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,849
Now look, each guy here is
responsible for five girls a piece.

584
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,400
That's how I did the math.
Five, 10, 15, 20, 25.

585
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,289
- Guys, guys...
- I make 30, okay?

586
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,249
Guys! I don't need this.

587
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,607
Tomorrow is the biggest day of my life.

588
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,364
- Here we go.
- Get to marry my queen.

589
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,284
I need you guys on point and on time.

590
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,443
No, you're right. Did you remember to
wax your vagina for the weekend?

591
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,730
Think like a man! Just for five minutes.

592
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,087
- I am acting like a man.
- You're not acting like a man.

593
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,891
You got the rest of your life to follow
this woman around a grocery store.

594
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,331
- Stop!
- Tomorrow's a big day.

595
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,330
- This is your bachelor party, Michael.
- And this is wisdom.

596
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,609
I'm your best man. Let me do my job.
I done printed these flyers and shit.

597
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,250
Why don't we see a show or something?

598
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,970
Don't worry, there will be a show.

599
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,123
Wait. Criss Angel's still in town.
We could start off there.

600
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,089
<i>Jersey Boy</i> won eight Tonys.

601
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,761
<i>We had decided to run the motion offense.</i>

602
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,923
<i>Which means keep moving
and keep your problems to yourself.</i>

603
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,931
<i>The maid of honor was about to
put her game plan into effect.</i>

604
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,001
<i>Or so she thought.</i>

605
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,521
Hello, sweetie.

606
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,490
I heard you were having a little
get-together for the bridesmaids

607
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,050
and thought I'd bring a few refreshments.

608
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,366
Thank you.

609
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,601
You're welcome.

610
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,365
You won't be needing this.

611
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,801
Another one.

612
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,762
Put the tea over to the left.
Girls are gonna love this.

613
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,249
- Ladies.
- Hey!

614
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,971
Sonia! You came already.

615
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,768
- My God, your outfit is so cute.
- Thank you!

616
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,922
But it is not complete without

617
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,644
- this.
- There you go.

618
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,644
Thank you, guys.

619
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,881
You know what, though?

620
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,326
I think there's still something missing.

621
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,171
- Does feel like something's missing.
- There's definitely something missing.

622
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,607
Candace, meet Idris.

623
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,205
Give me your arm.

624
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,009
- Awful.
- Come here.

625
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,607
So you can get used to being chained to
one man for the rest of your life.

626
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,050
- My very own Idris.
- Let's hit the pool.

627
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,687
Mr. Ward?

628
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,966
Yes!

629
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,648
Hey, guys. I'm sorry, she just called me.
Let me get through y'all.

630
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,643
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Just let me get through.

631
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,802
Excuse me! Sorry! Hercules.

632
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,123
Hi. Welcome to Venus pool. I'm Leikula.

633
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,326
I'm Cedric. How are you?

634
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,004
I just spoke with Declan
and we have your cabana prepared.

635
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,366
I'm following you.

636
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,771
- Perfect.
- Patience.

637
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,561
Oh, yeah.

638
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,726
<i>Every player knows during the day,
the real action's at the pool.</i>

639
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,407
<i>It's the place to hook up and strut your
stuff and check out everyone else's.</i>

640
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,324
<i>And the best part?
Chlorine kills everything.</i>

641
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,640
Is this a topless pool?

642
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,246
Nah, Mike. They just got T-shirts
with their breasts on them.

643
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,527
Why do you think the line was
so long, baby? Come on, man.

644
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,170
I hope this meets your expectations.

645
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,608
Oh, no. Sweetie, this has exceeded
our expectations. Thank you.

646
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,206
- You're welcome. Enjoy.
- I appreciate it. Okay.

647
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,681
- What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
- All right.

648
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,161
I suggest you all look at some of
this scattered ass around here.

649
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,685
<i>We thought we hit the jackpot.</i>

650
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,366
<i>But the danger of Vegas
is the mirage it creates.</i>

651
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,761
<i>The men were putting on a cool front.
But let me tell you something.</i>

652
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,286
<i>From underneath,
trouble was brewing like a pressure cooker.</i>

653
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,641
Do you see what I am walking around with?

654
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,846
I see it.

655
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,086
<i>Unfortunately for the girls,</i>

656
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,243
<i>their set offense had run into
a nasty zone defense.</i>

657
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,087
Shit!

658
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,005
- Un-cuff me!
- I don't have the key.

659
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,047
Un-cuff me!

660
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,281
I got it. Watch out.

661
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,443
Ladies.

662
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,528
- Hi!
- Hi!

663
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,289
- Just go. Hide the cuffs.
- Come right on in.

664
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,640
High tea.

665
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,564
Damn! Look at that.

666
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,926
Dude, can you imagine
having a woman like that?

667
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,049
Just keep this in mind. For every
supermodel you see, every hot girl you see,

668
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,406
there's some dude that's sick of her shit.

669
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,204
Zeke, you and Mya
having problems again, man?

670
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,851
- Obviously.
- She's suddenly fixated with my past.

671
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,571
That whole "Zeke the Freak" thing.

672
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,925
Oh, God!

673
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,001
Imagine that.

674
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,289
Take a second to look at this damn view.
This is what it's about, man!

675
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,486
Fellas!

676
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,721
Bennett!

677
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,491
- Get your ass up! What's wrong with you?
- Clay Aiken! Asleep.

678
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,601
What are you all doin'?

679
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,967
<i>- MotorStorm: Apocalypse,</i> baby!
- And somehow, he's whooping my ass!

680
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,885
I'm about to whoop both your asses.
Do you know where you are right now?

681
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,121
At the pool.

682
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,964
- We're in Vegas!
- Why are you screaming?

683
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,600
- Mr. Ward?
- Yes.

684
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,365
- Care for another drink?
- You know what?

685
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,646
Yes. You know what?
Give me something strong.

686
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,246
And give me five more shots of testosterone

687
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,890
for these ladies that I'm with right now.

688
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,086
- Thank you.
- Yes.

689
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,811
Boy, I'd like to climb that mountain
right there, I'll tell you that much.

690
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,206
That is a big badonkadonk.

691
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,282
All of a sudden, you're
good at video games?

692
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,283
Listen, I play this every night with Duke.

693
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,964
Duke's a great kid. He cracks me up.

694
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,451
You know what he asked me earlier today?

695
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,410
If, after the wedding,
if it would be okay if he called me "Dad".

696
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,165
Time out.

697
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,130
Let me ask you a question.
That doesn't freak you out at all?

698
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,281
What?

699
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,250
Out of nowhere, all of a sudden...
You're an instant dad, just like that.

700
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,651
You're responsible for
this whole other human.

701
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,051
- No.
- Not a cat, not a dog.

702
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,727
This is a human,
with teeth and hair and bones and blood.

703
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,882
What if they hurt somebody?
What if they get kidnapped?

704
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,282
Or if they kidnap somebody? Either way, it's
all down to you for the rest of your life.

705
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,486
That doesn't freak you out?

706
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,369
No. I'm excited about it.

707
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,171
I don't even know why I ask you stuff.

708
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,844
I want you to stand up and enjoy this...

709
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,160
What?

710
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,605
Man, you gotta take one of these.

711
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,284
What's that?

712
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,441
We're looking for people for amateur night.

713
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,171
You're looking at the wrong people, man.
You need to be looking in the pool.

714
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,605
You got your pick of the litter out there.

715
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,001
They look good,
but we need some men, and you fit the bill.

716
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,844
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

717
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,969
'Cause I got my shirt off, you probably
judging by my amazing physique that

718
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,485
that's my cup of tea, it's not.

719
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,206
There's huge cash prizes.
You come down, you win some money...

720
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,806
- I'll take one.
- Bennett, sit your ass down.

721
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,847
Free hot buffet.

722
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,968
So, some hot chick just rolls up on you.

723
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,443
She's like, "Do you mind helping me
with a little bit of suntan lotion?"

724
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,000
- What do you do?
- It'd never happen, but I'd stand my ground.

725
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,684
Hello, Blue Eyes.

726
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,602
I was hoping you could help me.
There's a couple of spots I can't reach.

727
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,690
I probably, probably shouldn't.

728
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,285
You probably should.

729
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,568
What, you're in a
relationship or something?

730
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,967
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

731
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,121
So am I.

732
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,282
- Really?
- This is Vegas, baby. Lighten up.

733
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,641
You heard her, Dom. It's Veg-Ass.

734
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,490
Vegas. Yep.

735
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,971
I love her.

736
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,081
All right.

737
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,207
Sweetie, sit down.

738
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,731
- Let me show you how it is around here.
- Okay, no.

739
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,451
'Cause my hands...
I'm sorry, did you just spit at me?

740
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,561
'Cause we gonna talk about that.

741
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,928
Excuse me, what is going on? Talk to me.

742
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,247
Spit it out, Dom!

743
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,481
- It didn't...
- What didn't?

744
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,528
- She just wasn't quite...
- She wasn't what?

745
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,329
- She wasn't tall enough.
- Dom, let me tell you something.

746
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,767
You know that men spend
their entire life savings to go to Brazil?

747
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,968
You just had Brazil come over here,
and you're gonna turn it away?

748
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,361
You know what, y'all?
I'm sick of this Non-tourage.

749
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,807
'Cause that's what I'm with right now.
I'm gonna get me a new crew.

750
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,881
Ced, you being dramatic.

751
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,209
I'ma roll with some sailors
and some congressmen.

752
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,169
- Republicans!
- Shut up, Bennett!

753
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,004
You know, I'm done.

754
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,765
Turn up, that's what I'll do.
I'ma have me a good time.

755
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,207
- You gonna join the fun?
- Girl, you damn right I'ma join the fun!

756
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,891
Yeah!

757
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,330
See what I'm saying?
Y'all wanna sit over here on lounge chairs.

758
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,526
I'm about to get in the water
with some titties.

759
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,169
That's what I tried to give you, Mike. You
didn't want this life, I'm gonna take it!

760
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,409
It's too deep! I can't swim!

761
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,811
It's like <i>Finding Nemo.</i>

762
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,565
One of you bitches grab me!

763
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,369
Should we help him?

764
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,441
Nah.

765
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,646
<i>Help!</i>

766
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,724
<i>Turns out, I wasn't the only one
in need of rescuing.</i>

767
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,040
Where was I?

768
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,121
The article.

769
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,567
Yes, yes, yes, the article
in the <i>O Magazine.</i>

770
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,291
They talked about
all the craziness that goes on

771
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,402
in these bachelor and bachelorette parties.

772
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,087
I read the same article. And the women
are getting just as wild as the men.

773
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,686
With the <i>Magic Mike</i> strippers
and the bridesmaids dares.

774
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,968
Or faking an orgasm, you know.

775
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,002
All of that in a crowded bar.

776
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,249
Or doing Jello shots off a stranger's abs?

777
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,051
I don't know why women can't have
just as much fun as men.

778
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,487
She's right. Getting a lap dance
at your bachelor party is expected.

779
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,641
But if women have fun...

780
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,205
You're whores!

781
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,050
- Did she just call us whores?
- Yeah.

782
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,920
Fortunately, I don't have to worry about
all that behavior with you, Candace.

783
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,764
All that girlish foolishness.
You're much too old for that!

784
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,406
Much too old.

785
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,208
I heard you the first "old".

786
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,731
So, what are you guys gonna do tonight?

787
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,765
Nothing too wild, you know, just girl time,
you know, girls of the same age.

788
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,491
And cocktails at a couple clubs.
Maybe take in a show.

789
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,211
Good. Then you'll have plenty of time.

790
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,886
Time? Time for what?

791
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,366
- I've gotta get away from her.
- I know, I know.

792
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,521
Anybody got any sleeping pills?

793
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,967
Don't worry. I can get rid of her.

794
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,010
- How?
- I can handle that old battle-ax.

795
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,401
Ladies, I've got another surprise.

796
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,561
We've got reservations tonight...

797
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,043
Excuse me. Miss Loretta,
I am so sorry to disappoint you, sweetie,

798
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,088
but we already have plans.

799
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,721
I was able to squeeze in a reservation
for five at Nobu. Corner booth.

800
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,723
- Isn't that a coincidence?
- How so?

801
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,768
Andre the concierge

802
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,606
was able to score reservations
for seven tonight at Nobu.

803
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,524
At the head table. So we're going, girls!

804
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,171
I can't believe you were
gonna exclude Tish.

805
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,244
Damn, she's good!

806
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,924
Welcome to the rest of my life.

807
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,809
Okay, you guys,
there's gotta be something that we can do.

808
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,087
What does Miss Loretta want or need?

809
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,571
She needs to get laid.

810
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,284
Wait a minute.

811
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,124
When does your Uncle Eddie arrive?

812
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,646
Didn't you say he flirted with her
at the couple's party?

813
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,327
- No, it will never happen.
- Never say never in Vegas.

814
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,000
Floyd "Money" Mayweather!
I'ma get my dollar sign...

815
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,041
Stop!

816
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,168
Floyd! Can you let him go, man? Please!

817
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,130
- Let him go! Let him go!
- Bennett, get up!

818
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,247
He's way too aggressive!

819
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,688
Listen, Floyd, he didn't mean no harm, man.
He just a fan, that's all.

820
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,330
I follow you on Twitter and MySpace.

821
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,767
That's all that is.
Dude, we didn't mean no disrespect.

822
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,525
We here, my friend's getting married.
We having a bachelor party tonight.

823
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,444
We gonna do it at the Caesar's
in the Constantine Villa.

824
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,601
Nice.

825
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,966
I'm just trying to splurge
and show him a good time.

826
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,883
That's what you call $40,000 a night?

827
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,207
He doesn't have a gold card.
That's the problem.

828
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,211
Dude, one of you guys
gotta research that for him.

829
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,489
You know what? You gotta just look that up
yourself, but it's a good investment.

830
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,245
Let me get you this.
This is where we gonna be at tonight.

831
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,926
Just read it, guys! It's a flyer, man!

832
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,447
Here, Floyd? Floyd, can you see me?

833
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,925
Let me slide it.

834
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,883
Floyd, can you get that?

835
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,081
Get the flyer.

836
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,405
Floyd, did you see it?
All right, that's where we at, man.

837
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,561
I'm gonna come check this out.

838
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,802
Cool. Well, okay... You
know, you all goin'.

839
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,167
'Cause you all got stuff to do.
Goin', man. Thank you again.

840
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,720
- There goes Justin Bieber's best friend!
- Champ, champ, champ!

841
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,885
<i>In this battle of the sexes, whichever group
came back with the best stories would win,</i>

842
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,167
<i>and I was determined to
keep us ahead of the girls.</i>

843
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,971
This is where it happens at, fellas. Okay?

844
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,681
We on home base right now, casino floor.
Now look, let's pick our poison.

845
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,771
- What is your problem, Bennett?
- Where you goin'?

846
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,843
Slots! Pharaoh's fortune.

847
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,042
Tish gave me 200 bucks to
gamble with this weekend.

848
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,964
Bennett, you walking around with a purse
on, you talking about playing slots?

849
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,121
What is your problem?

850
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,526
It's a fanny-pack, it's not a purse.

851
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,204
I don't care what it is,
it's attached to your spine!

852
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,760
- What's wrong with slots?
- Everything is wrong with slots!

853
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,525
We're not a group of old women
that just bussed in here from Bakersfield!

854
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,443
Now listen to me. We came here as a group

855
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,010
and we gonna play as a group.
Let's play Blackjack.

856
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,290
I only played blackjack once
and I lost 300 bucks.

857
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,361
- So what?
- I lost 600.

858
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,330
Spring Break, my junior year, it was my
entire money for weed the whole semester.

859
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,721
- I almost dropped out of school.
- Okay, now. Hey! Hey!

860
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,802
Y'all got negativity
floating all in the air!

861
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,765
I'ma take it, and I'ma put it in my pocket,
and guess what?

862
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,524
You're not getting that back. Okay?

863
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,043
Now we will keep the fun train going.
Let's keep tchoo-tchooing, guys!

864
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,407
You rolling with the pros.
Just follow our lead.

865
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,687
- Thank you, Dom! Thank you.
- No!

866
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,810
Guys, there comes a time in a man's life
when he has to take a stand.

867
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,724
- Can I go play slots?
- Take your ass to that slot machine.

868
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,121
- Don't bring that negative energy here!
- Is there a bathroom that way?

869
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,201
What are you doing? Mike?

870
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,681
- Guys, can I get a second with Mike?
- Guys, I'm just going to the...

871
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,127
- Just y'all go ahead. Just go ahead.
- Take all the time you want.

872
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,247
Dude, what is going on?

873
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,608
I cannot do the job that you asked me to do
if you don't allow it.

874
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,524
I got a great time for you, man.
I got some shit set up.

875
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,163
We gonna have a good...
Dom! I told you don't pick no table!

876
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,288
Ladies, shall we?

877
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,841
Damn it!

878
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,285
- Hit me.
- You split those!

879
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,001
- You said never split the aces!
- I said always split the aces!

880
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,401
You feeling all right?

881
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,687
Don't be getting in my head,
Randy, all right? Hit it.

882
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,281
Damn it!

883
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,691
Hit me, baby, hit me!

884
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,051
The greens are how much?

885
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,366
Twenty-five.

886
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,291
Oh, God! You gotta be kidding me!

887
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,809
Ced, Ced, come on, man.

888
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,041
I'll give you some chips!

889
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,921
No!

890
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,650
- This ain't over, Randy.
- I'm here every night, son.

891
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,721
This ain't over.

892
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,769
Yes, can I please have a
martini, straight up?

893
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,328
Come here, come here, come here.
Cancel that.

894
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,250
Candace.

895
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,248
Alcohol is the leading cause
of hangovers and bloating.

896
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,323
I am glad I'm not the bride.

897
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,289
Ladies, I've got another surprise.

898
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,611
Tickets to see Dionne Warwick tonight,
fifth row center!

899
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,131
Score!

900
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,445
Dionne Warwick?

901
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,401
Yeah, you... You told me you
and your mother love Dionne Warwick, right?

902
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,285
Right, but I...

903
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,488
Good, then. It's settled.

904
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,566
Thanks, Candace.

905
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,609
Hanover bridal party is right over there.

906
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,091
- Uncle Eddie?
- Ladies.

907
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,811
Uncle Eddie! What are you doing here?

908
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,045
I had to come and toast my favorite
little niece before her big day!

909
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,327
- I got your message.
- Thank you.

910
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,961
Miss Loretta.

911
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,170
I'm so sorry to hear about
the untimely passing of Deacon Johnson.

912
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,964
I know what it's like
to have loved and lost.

913
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,641
If there's anything,
and I do mean anything I can do to help,

914
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,361
just let me know.

915
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,962
Now, how many times have
you used that line on a woman?

916
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,084
I've said it plenty of times to
plenty of women, Miss Loretta.

917
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,810
But it's the first time
I've said it to a lady.

918
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,411
Excuse me, she also has tickets to
go see Dionne Warwick tonight.

919
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,642
- And no one to go with.
- Nobody.

920
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,330
Dionne Warwick? No kidding.

921
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,448
You know, my church choir
just sang <i>I Say a Little Prayer...</i>

922
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,010
Hallelujah!

923
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,250
If you'd allow me to
buy one of these tickets...

924
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,163
No, no! You can have mine.

925
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,288
- Please.
- Take mine!

926
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,970
Hey, hey, hey!

927
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,680
I'd love to accompany you.

928
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,806
How about it's my treat? I mean, after
all, <i>That's What Friends Are For.</i>

929
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,362
Looks like Miss "Whore-etta"
is back in the saddle.

930
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,926
<i>Momentum had suddenly swung
in the girls' direction.</i>

931
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,209
<i>And the guys were about to commit
the first of many turnovers.</i>

932
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,211
Word on the street is, Kristen is trying
to have a baby like right now, J.

933
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,801
Right?

934
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,886
Word on the street. Yeah.
No, we're both really excited about it.

935
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,962
When you ain't getting no sex,
let's see how excited you are.

936
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,606
- You ain't lying about that!
- "I don't feel sexy right now."

937
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,920
You ready for fatherhood or what?

938
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,446
- Fatherhood's gonna be awesome, Jeremy.
- Thanks, Big Mouth.

939
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,443
I think Jeremy's fears
are somewhat justified.

940
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,369
Think about it.
How does a child raise a child?

941
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,487
Zeke, really?

942
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,891
- Finally!
- You too, Mike?

943
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,248
No, my frat brothers.
Isaac and Terrell just got in town.

944
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,721
These two are the biggest party animals
I've ever met.

945
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,248
Hopefully, they can contain you.
'Cause you such a wild animal.

946
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,731
Maybe you can find a water park.

947
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,644
Chef. The tasting menu is exquisite.

948
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,326
My friends and I, we thank you.
It's incredible.

949
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,846
He has to say that.
How about the rest of you?

950
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,167
- How about perfection?
- It's amazing.

951
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,924
Michel, a round of
whatever it is they want.

952
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,167
So, fellas, if you could spare your friend,
I have a few minutes

953
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,765
if you want a tour of the restaurant.

954
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,251
Lead the way.

955
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,603
I love <i>Ratatouille.</i>
It's one of my favorites.

956
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,727
So, Dominic,

957
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,850
I took a look over your prospectus,
and I must say I'm very impressed.

958
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,763
But I'm not looking to
invest in another restaurant.

959
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,041
Right.

960
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,283
'Cause I am opening a new one myself

961
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,728
and I'm in the market for a new sous chef.

962
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,290
And I think you are my guy.

963
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,521
Me?

964
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,726
Your new sous chef?

965
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,041
Well, say something.

966
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,441
Are you really offering this to me? Now?

967
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,366
Your fusion tapas inspired
a whole new entree,

968
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,930
which is a fancy way of
saying I stole them.

969
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,411
I can't believe this is happening.

970
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,769
Did I mention my last three sous chefs
went on to create their own restaurants?

971
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,284
- That's the dream.
- And you could be next.

972
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,124
They are breaking ground on
the new space at Planet Hollywood.

973
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,567
Why don't you stop and take a look?

974
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,683
Planet Hollywood? Here in Vegas?

975
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,171
Excuse me, Chef?

976
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,250
I really think this can be huge.

977
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,681
Yeah.

978
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,204
I'm very excited about this.

979
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,081
Oh, boy.

980
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,647
Ladies. You guys.
I'm gonna say goodnight to you now.

981
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,206
Thank you so much for including me
in the day, it was so much fun.

982
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,487
- It was our pleasure.
- Thank you.

983
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,371
Tish, what are you gonna do tonight?

984
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,050
Well, I'm gonna have a "mom-cation".

985
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,164
I'm going to play the slots
a little bit by myself

986
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,363
and then I'll just go nose around
the gift shops by myself,

987
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,286
take selfies with the statues by myself.

988
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,601
I don't know,
just like drink alone in my room.

989
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,570
It might be a crazy night,
but you're more than welcome to join us.

990
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,926
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah, come.

991
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,201
Fine, I'll do it!

992
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,044
I do not wanna be alone
in my room in Vegas.

993
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,201
Okay, Tish.

994
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,682
If you're gonna join the bachelorette
party, I have one cardinal rule.

995
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,285
- You must dress up.
- Yeah.

996
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,124
Yeah, because we have to
be able to get into the club.

997
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,521
So you're gonna have to
pull it together a little bit.

998
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,046
- Like, belt it?
- No.

999
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,487
You know what? I have a different twin set.

1000
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,524
That's rule number two,
is that you can't wear a twin set ever.

1001
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,601
Okay.

1002
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,569
Get a cute little dress and some shoes,
some heels.

1003
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,725
These are the highest heels I'm allowed
to wear, because I have rolling arches.

1004
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,601
Well, this is all I brought, so I don't
know what else you want me to wear.

1005
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,121
Bebe!

1006
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,765
Come, come, come.

1007
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,084
Shots up!

1008
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,811
To Mike! I'm sending you off the right way.

1009
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,123
I'm the best best man anybody can have!

1010
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,087
You want Ceddy, baby?

1011
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,367
Coco, did I ever tell you that
I love a woman in uniform?

1012
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,411
Did I tell you I love a woman
without a uniform? Go, Coco!

1013
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,209
Dom. You all right?

1014
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,248
- Yeah, I'm good.
- You been really down since dinner.

1015
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,402
- Seriously, what's up, man?
- Stop babysitting your drink, Dom.

1016
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,686
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1017
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,603
Oh, yes, you are fine.

1018
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,927
I think she likes you.

1019
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,890
No, Dom, we can see when the wheels
are turning, man. Come on, out with it.

1020
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,405
Chef Cotillard offered me a job.

1021
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,767
- What did he say?
- The Chef offered him a gig.

1022
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,126
That's huge, Dom!

1023
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,202
- That's a celebration right there.
- Especially if I take it.

1024
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,089
- Why wouldn't you take it?
- It's in Vegas.

1025
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,969
- Lauren and I live in LA.
- This is a pattern with him.

1026
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,405
It's called the Dom Syndrome.

1027
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,721
- It's called, he's officially her bitch.
- That, too.

1028
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,807
What are you all talking about?

1029
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,565
We talking about the fact that
she dumped you, and you took her back!

1030
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,641
- I know what I want.
- Stop!

1031
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,206
So, now you telling me you gonna give up
the job of your dreams,

1032
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,282
the job that could make
you, for that woman?

1033
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,362
- For the woman.
- Spoken like a true...

1034
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,521
Do not say it again.

1035
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,681
It's actually kinda romantic.

1036
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,250
You swimming in the Kool-Aid.

1037
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,721
What good is a dream job
if he's gonna be miserable?

1038
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,723
Let me ask you a question.
Do you all synchronize your cycles?

1039
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,689
There's an app for that, and I'm serious.

1040
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,047
But wait, I got one question,
then I'ma back off.

1041
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,805
Do you honestly believe that
she would do the same for you?

1042
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,450
Wait a minute!

1043
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,126
Good question, Zeke.
How do you do it? Tell me.

1044
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,804
<i>Can we have Coco to the main stage?</i>

1045
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,769
Let me help you down. Jesus.

1046
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,842
Excuse me, Coco. Thank you for the dancing.

1047
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,204
It's show time. My frat brothers,
Isaac and Terrell? They just showed up.

1048
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,361
There they go!

1049
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,845
What's up, man? I'm Cedric.

1050
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,410
I'm the best man with the plan.
What's up, baby?

1051
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,371
Ced, it's not them.

1052
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,724
There they go!

1053
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,522
Birds of a feather all flock together.

1054
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,649
What fraternity did Mike pledge?

1055
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,165
Abercrombie and Fitch Epsilon.

1056
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,971
This is Isaac and this is Terrell.

1057
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,930
What kinda white woman
names her son Terrell?

1058
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,366
I'm just messing with you!

1059
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,126
- Chain him up!
- Get it on.

1060
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,045
Guys, guys, guys!

1061
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,731
Why didn't you think of that, Zeke?

1062
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,643
Probably because black men
don't put chains on black men.

1063
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,087
White men put chains on black men. <i>Django.</i>

1064
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,650
D is silent. I saw that movie.

1065
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,086
Guys, what's a pickaninny?

1066
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,921
Guys, you gotta meet my frat brothers.
This is Isaac.

1067
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,729
- How are you doing, little guy?
- And this is Terrell, guys.

1068
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,771
I've heard so much about you guys,
and none of it is true.

1069
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,566
Where are your drinks, ladies?
Come on! What is this?

1070
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,449
Is this a Shirley Temple and a club soda?

1071
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,488
- Whose bar mitzvah is this?
- You gotta take this night...

1072
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,323
Absolutely.
You and me are gonna die tonight. Let's go.

1073
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,801
I told you, you're gonna love these guys.

1074
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,761
Yes!

1075
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,487
Come on, Tish!

1076
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,362
Girl, those are three-inch heels.

1077
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,885
These shoes are killing me.

1078
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,248
- Miss Harris? I'm JP, your driver.
- Yes?

1079
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,006
Ladies, your ride awaits.

1080
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,926
Wait! This is our ride?

1081
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,126
It is now!

1082
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,726
Wait, you stole the boys' ride?

1083
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,047
Genius!

1084
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,327
- After you, ladies!
- I love that!

1085
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,887
- How are they gonna get around?
- Who cares? That's not our problem.

1086
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,723
What the hell is this?

1087
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,406
This isn't my ride. I ordered the pimped-out
party bus with a stripper pole in it.

1088
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,050
- It's got a pole.
- Cedric, what the hell is that?

1089
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,207
Zeke, don't start, man.

1090
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,089
I'm liking your gay vibe, man.

1091
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,400
Stop. Everybody stop for a second.

1092
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,643
Do we look like a group of guys that's gonna
roll to a spot in something like this?

1093
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,324
As a matter of fact, you do.

1094
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,004
Man, this is Vegas. I've seen it all.

1095
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,447
Are you gonna get in the car?
'Cause you're getting charged regardless.

1096
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,090
Dude, I'm not gonna argue with you.
We walking.

1097
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,924
Ced, you know how long
these Vegas blocks are?

1098
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,162
- Let's do it!
- I'm getting in the car, bro.

1099
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,846
20% gratuity is non-refundable.

1100
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,924
<i>The women had not only taken our ride,
they had taken our mojo.</i>

1101
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,684
All right, what's on the agenda?

1102
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,922
Actually, I have about 10 agendas
for us this evening.

1103
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,445
I fear them already.

1104
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,204
As you should.

1105
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,726
Okay, the first one is...

1106
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,801
Is someone vibrating?

1107
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,851
- You're not gonna answer that, are you?
- Put it on silent.

1108
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,843
I have to get this. Hello, Lauren Harris.

1109
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,126
<i>Please hold for Lee Fox.</i>

1110
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,531
- Who wants a cocktail?
- Me!

1111
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,601
All right.

1112
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,921
That food was garlicky.
You guys got any gum?

1113
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,963
I think I have something in my purse,
side pocket.

1114
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,646
- I'll have one of those.
- I definitely need one.

1115
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,960
Me, me, me.

1116
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,211
- And a Benadryl, if you have one.
- Pass me one.

1117
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,807
Earthy.

1118
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,245
<i>- Lauren, it's Lee.</i>
- Hi, Lee.

1119
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,170
All I can say is congratulations.
It's unanimous.

1120
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,050
You're officially COO of
our global media group.

1121
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,721
Did you hear me?

1122
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,802
Yes. I'm...

1123
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,608
I'm just, I'm stunned. I'm speechless.

1124
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,524
Welcome to the Big Apple, Lauren Harris.
And to the big leagues.

1125
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,807
Now go, have fun with your bridesmaids.

1126
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,530
<i>We'll lunch on Monday.</i>

1127
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,087
Okay, here we go. There you go.

1128
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,771
Are you okay?

1129
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,201
Lauren?

1130
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,808
- Someone's gonna throw up later.
- You're ready to party.

1131
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,881
Let's go!

1132
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,766
Vegas!

1133
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,641
- Hello, Sofia. How are you?
- I'm wonderful, Zeke.

1134
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,127
Guys, guys.

1135
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,249
This is the lovely Sofia.
Sofia, this is the boys.

1136
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,049
- Hello.
- Hey.

1137
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,441
- How's it going?
- Easy. Easy.

1138
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,000
- Let's go. Take your time, man.
- Let's give him some space.

1139
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,091
So, how are you?

1140
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,285
<i>Zeke had to call a time-out after
running into yet another old flame,</i>

1141
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,091
<i>who made it clear
her life was much better without him.</i>

1142
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,528
<i>Turns out that he was still holding on
to the fantasized memories of his past!</i>

1143
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,446
<i>But the real question was, if ladies
no longer saw him as Zeke the Freak,</i>

1144
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,090
<i>then who was he?</i>

1145
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,287
Let me ask you something,
how did you let that slip away?

1146
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,362
I think I was just an asshole.

1147
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,522
Sometimes, you gotta wait
to find the right woman.

1148
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,642
The perfect woman.
And that's who you marry.

1149
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,200
Zeke ain't getting married!
What the hell is going on?

1150
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,567
We here to have a bachelor party, men!

1151
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,006
Can we do that?

1152
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,801
Saying the same thing over and over again
to you all, man.

1153
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,961
Nobody answer any phones.

1154
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,724
- Solidarity, brothers!
- I like that.

1155
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,484
Gailzilla ain't gonna mess up
my trip this time.

1156
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,325
<i>What did you call me, Cedric?
You know I can hear you.</i>

1157
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,526
What do you want, Gail?

1158
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,605
<i>Why the hell do I have
over $40,000 worth of charges</i>

1159
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,570
<i>- on my frozen company credit card?</i>
- What're you talkin' about, 40,000 what?

1160
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,962
<i>You're dead, Cedric. You are dead!</i>

1161
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,644
<i>Baby, who you talking to?</i>

1162
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,051
- Who was that?
<i>- I gotta go.</i>

1163
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,451
- Gail!
<i>- This isn't over.</i>

1164
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,570
Everything all right, C?

1165
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,444
I gotta... God damn it!

1166
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,281
Is Gail here?

1167
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,691
Don't worry about it, I'll go get him.

1168
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,364
You guys go ahead.
I'll meet you at Planet Hollywood.

1169
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,084
This music is so intense!

1170
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,165
Yeah. The beat just moved right through me.

1171
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,241
I feel like I'm on a conveyor belt.

1172
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,367
These bitches are trippin'!

1173
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,364
Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Sorry.

1174
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,409
Hey, Marcel!

1175
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,005
Mr. Ward. How can I help you?

1176
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,970
I think there's a little
glitch with my bill.

1177
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,690
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

1178
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,009
I booked the Constantine Villa under
a very special promotion on my gold card

1179
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,809
- for 4,000 a night.
- No. "Off."

1180
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,803
I'm sorry, what? Pardon? What'd you say?

1181
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,850
The promotion is for
$4,000 discount a night.

1182
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,766
Normally, the Constantine
is $44,000 a night,

1183
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,322
but with your special promotion,
you are getting an amazing savings.

1184
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,607
Plus, you're getting 40,000 gold points.

1185
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,841
I don't give a damn about them gold points.

1186
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,601
You know what, Marcel?

1187
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,330
- Actually, you know what I just realized?
- What?

1188
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,607
- That room is too much. It's too big.
- Too big?

1189
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,087
'Cause it's too big for one person.

1190
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,242
It's cold, it's lonely. I can't sleep.

1191
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,406
Do you think I can move to a more,
lesser, a more lesser room?

1192
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,131
- Smaller room?
- Something smaller, with one bed?

1193
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,328
Absolutely, I can do that for you.

1194
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,247
There would be no additional charge since
you are staying in the Constantine tonight,

1195
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,402
which requires our standard
72-hour cancellation.

1196
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,051
Oh, God.

1197
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,125
But you know, you know what, Mr. Ward,

1198
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,645
I think that we can see to
just charging you for the one night.

1199
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,051
- One night?
- Does that help?

1200
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,121
Yeah.

1201
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,605
Is there something else
I can help you with?

1202
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,809
Where is the... Where's the ATM?

1203
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,245
The ATM is right there.

1204
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,084
Marcel, just say it, where?

1205
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,844
- To your right.
- Over here?

1206
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,411
- Just right over there.
- Whose is this?

1207
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,562
- This is for guests as they enter.
- Well, I need it.

1208
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,131
Ced, what happened? What are you doing?

1209
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,123
- I gotta win some money, Dom.
- For what?

1210
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,328
- I gotta win money right now.
- Ced, wait! Stop, stop. Talk to me.

1211
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,686
- What, Dom, what?
- What happened?

1212
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,609
The room was a lot more
than I expected it to be.

1213
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,404
All right, cool. So, how much?

1214
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,323
$36,000 a night more.

1215
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,361
You ain't got it, Dom.

1216
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,369
My heart, man!

1217
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,084
Give it back, man. Just give it back.

1218
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,326
Ced, one second.

1219
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,686
Just tell me what happened.

1220
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,491
What do you mean, tell you what happened?
I just told you what happened, Dom!

1221
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,289
Am I speaking Spanish?

1222
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,204
- I got you.
- No, you don't got me!

1223
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,641
What makes it worse is I put the entire
$40,000 on Gail's company card.

1224
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,043
- What did you do that for?
- You think I meant to do it? Shut up!

1225
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,531
- She gonna kick yo ass.
- No shit, Dom!

1226
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,728
You're saying everything I know,
you making this a lot worse!

1227
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,246
- You think?
- I gotta get my life back and fix it.

1228
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,845
The only way I'ma fix it
is the way I know how.

1229
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,081
I gotta win my money back.

1230
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,811
But Ced, here's the problem. No one ever
wins when they need to in Vegas.

1231
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,646
Who are you, Nega-Tron?
I got two words for you, <i>Rain Man.</i>

1232
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,882
<i>Rain Man,</i> right, okay,
let me call the guys.

1233
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,849
No, you're not calling nobody!

1234
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,765
This is Michael's day, man.
I'm not gonna ruin this for him, all right?

1235
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,604
And I don't want those guys around me
while I'm gambling!

1236
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,045
They gonna throw off my vibe.

1237
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,804
Now what I need you to do,
I need you to be my friend.

1238
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,406
Be my wingman right now. Buy me an hour.

1239
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,447
All right.

1240
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,760
One hour, Dom, that's all I need.

1241
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,922
Heart Bar. Meet us there in one hour.

1242
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,365
- One hour, that's all I need.
- One hour, Ced.

1243
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,171
I just told you the time, Dom!
Don't say it no more!

1244
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,524
Stressing me out!

1245
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,247
- What do you think the boys are doing?
- Strip club!

1246
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,724
Michael specifically said that he did not
want one of those skanky Vegas ho weekends,

1247
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,126
and he hates strip clubs.

1248
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,201
Girl, they are men!

1249
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,442
And what about his creepy little best man?

1250
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,090
And let's not get started
on his first lieutenant!

1251
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,448
I don't give a damn where they're at
or what they're doing

1252
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,450
or if they have stoned sperm
or if they even want kids or not!

1253
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,562
- What did Jeremy do?
- Not me!

1254
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,802
He compared me to Louis Gossett Jr.!

1255
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,042
- No!
- Apparently, I'm not fun anymore.

1256
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,043
You are so fun!

1257
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,805
- I know! Exactly! Next round's on me.
- Gotcha.

1258
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,727
Speaking of fun, for your challenge
at the Gallery Club, Miss Hall,

1259
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,291
you have to dance on a bar,
table or in a go-go cage!

1260
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,361
No!

1261
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,204
You think Jeremy's right?

1262
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,885
'Cause they say

1263
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,691
where you're at in your sex life
is where you're at in real life.

1264
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,561
What if I'm just controlling, you know?
What if I am a drill sergeant?

1265
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,005
I'm fun, all right?

1266
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,003
I'm fun, okay?

1267
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,245
I'm back, Randy.

1268
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,686
<i>All right.
We're gonna take you guys back to the '90s.</i>

1269
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,685
Hey, here you guys are.

1270
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,245
- Cedric okay?
- Yeah, he's good.

1271
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,651
Where is my best man?

1272
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,088
Still the best.
You guys need another round? It's on me.

1273
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,286
I'm full, man.

1274
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,290
Cedric got about two more minutes
and then I'm designating you the best man.

1275
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,521
You know what? Let's do some shots!

1276
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,601
I gotta pee.

1277
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,681
Yeah, hurry back.

1278
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,524
Told you not to break the seal.
You'll be peeing all night.

1279
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,491
All right, let's do another shot.

1280
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:41,042
Guys, I'm ready to go downstairs
to see my best man on a table.

1281
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,328
<i>It actually looked like he was up.</i>

1282
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,762
Your bachelor party!

1283
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,720
Stop it!

1284
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,081
Sorry I'm not the perfect woman
for your perfect son, Miss "Whore-etta!"

1285
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,720
But I want my white roses, biatch!

1286
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,881
Hell, yeah!

1287
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,244
They gonna fire you, man!

1288
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,402
You ain't gonna be
able to work here no more.

1289
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,768
<i>In other business news,

- Listen to me!
- Dude, it's been an hour!

1297
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,850
Don't come over here
with that negative energy!

1298
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,206
Okay? Not right now, man, I'm up!

1299
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,521
I'm up like eight grand,
and I can win a lot more.

1300
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,081
Go over there, go throw
a ball or something!

1301
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,561
Listen! Are you the best man
or the worst man?

1302
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,971
The worst man?

1303
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,161
Okay.

1304
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,362
I don't see any boobs in his face.

1305
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,568
You know what? You're 100% right.

1306
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,287
J.Crew and Ralph Lauren are right, man.

1307
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,482
Dude, I'm serious, Mike.
I've abandoned you.

1308
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,324
- You didn't abandon me.
- No, Mike, stop.

1309
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,927
I abdicated my duties and my responsibilities
for my own personal wants and needs!

1310
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,764
Cedric, you're good, you
just been gambling.

1311
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,450
That's not why you made me best man!

1312
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,602
You made me your best man
because I'm responsible.

1313
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,246
And you can trust me,
unlike anybody else here.

1314
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,243
Tomorrow's a new day, gentlemen,
but tonight,

1315
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,324
tonight, Cedric is back on duty.
You hear me? Okay?

1316
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,925
Let's go, guys!

1317
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,969
And, Randy, it's been a pleasure.

1318
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,646
Right behind you, Bennett.

1319
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,245
Go ahead, Zeke. Hey.

1320
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,928
What did I ask you for?
I said buy me some time.

1321
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,401
- I did the best I could!
- I could have had all the money back, Dom!

1322
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,207
Damn!

1323
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,807
Guys, it's midnight. It's midnight.
Guys, guys, listen.

1324
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,326
And this is not the alcohol talking, guys,

1325
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,643
this is the biggest day
of my life, gentlemen.

1326
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,321
This is the day I get to marry
the woman of my dreams, man.

1327
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,482
Come here, man. 'Cause I know how you feel.

1328
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,609
This is the 15th. This is my wedding day.

1329
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,047
And there's nobody I'd rather be with.

1330
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,610
Mike, you said today's the 15th?

1331
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,803
- Yeah, the day I get to marry Candace.
- Oh, my God, that's a sign.

1332
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,928
Mike, stop! I get it.

1333
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,287
You're getting married.
People do it every day. Stop.

1334
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,044
This is a sign!

1335
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,282
- Of our love.
- Mike, will you shut up?

1336
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,007
Please! Listen, I lost my virginity
when I was 15, okay?

1337
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,161
On the 15th.

1338
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,369
Me and Gail have been separated 15 times.
It's a sign!

1339
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,408
God, I get it!

1340
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,481
It's a sign!

1341
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,607
Just calm down!

1342
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,171
$10,000 on black 15.

1343
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,130
- You're melting down! Get it together!
- Listen to me!

1344
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,965
All that negative energy you're putting
in the air, take it out right now!

1345
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,124
This is a sign. $10,000, black 15.
Right now. Move.

1346
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,884
$10,000 on 15, table max.

1347
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,042
- Don't nobody talk to me right now.
- We shouldn't let him do this.

1348
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,282
- Cedric, are you serious?
- Zeke, don't talk to me no more.

1349
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,603
Somebody say something else to me,
I'm gonna get really upset. It's a sign!

1350
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,886
Are you letting him do this?

1351
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,246
Black 15.

1352
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,924
- Cedric.
- Black 15.

1353
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,487
Black 15.

1354
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,285
Black 15.

1355
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,164
Black 15!

1356
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,171
Black 15!

1357
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,441
No more bets!

1358
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,045
Black 15.

1359
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,651
Winner, black 15, winner.

1360
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,648
Yes, yes, yes! I told you!

1361
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,729
$350,000!

1362
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,881
I told you!

1363
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,881
Cedric.

1364
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,766
- You didn't win.
- Hold on, Zeke. Wait, stop, stop!

1365
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,530
Where's my money? I put
$10,000 right there.

1366
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,241
I was trying to help you,
so I made a safer bet for you.

1367
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,971
- You did what?
- Remember what you said? Negativity...

1368
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,883
So, I don't get the $350,000?

1369
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,724
- Listen to me!
- Do I have $350,000?

1370
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,689
Wait a minute, Ceddy.
Take it out of the air.

1371
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,683
Hold on, Zeke. Hold on, man.

1372
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,201
I'm gonna choke you out!

1373
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,681
Get your hands off me!

1374
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,524
I'm gonna kill you, Zeke!
I'm gonna kill you!

1375
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,011
Get off of me!

1376
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,283
I'm good. Get off me. Where's Zeke going?
I just wanna talk to him.

1377
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,125
Zeke, run! He's coming after you!

1378
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,723
<i>It was the third quarter,
and it was still anybody's game.</i>

1379
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,842
I can't believe you guys are hungry again.

1380
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,128
We need our energy after that performance.

1381
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,647
- True.
- Look, it's midnight!

1382
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,008
It's officially your wedding day!

1383
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,400
Oh, my God, it is!

1384
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,040
- What's wrong?
- It's all right to have wedding day jitters.

1385
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,125
It's not that. I was just thinking, when
you marry someone, you marry their family.

1386
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,282
And I can't marry Miss Loretta.
She hates me!

1387
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,044
Hate is a strong word.

1388
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,361
- And she is a strong woman!
- She's a bitch.

1389
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,521
Yeah, she is.

1390
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,410
And no matter how hard he tries,
with a mother like Loretta,

1391
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,403
Michael is always gonna be a mama's boy.

1392
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,370
Accept what you cannot change,
or it will destroy you.

1393
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,966
My grandma Eleanor told me that
the day I married Bennett,

1394
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,249
and it's gotten me through
15 wonderful years of marriage.

1395
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,051
I feel like that's so passive!
What, did you just give up?

1396
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,567
I believe that I can affect
change in my relationship.

1397
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,166
You can, but you can't change
a man's nature.

1398
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,560
- Exactly.
- She's right.

1399
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,883
You can't force a man to do anything.
Gotta let it happen naturally.

1400
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,849
So, basically, I'm just wasting my time.

1401
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,524
Nobody's saying you're wasting your time.

1402
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,648
You're still mad over
the Zeke the Freak thing.

1403
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,210
Yes! No!

1404
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,965
I'm not mad about that,
it's just, I feel like he's pulling away,

1405
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,963
and every time I talk about this wedding

1406
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,929
or your dress
or the fact that I'm a bridesmaid,

1407
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,890
he gets this look on his face
where he just looks horrified.

1408
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,121
Maybe he's just afraid of being married.

1409
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,044
But I never said anything about getting
married, so why would he think that?

1410
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,849
Probably because
all his friends are getting married?

1411
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,366
All men are terrified of getting married,

1412
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,683
because it reminds them of everything
they're never gonna get to do.

1413
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,082
"Tish, I think we should try a threesome."

1414
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,128
"Really, Bennett? Do you
know what that is?"

1415
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,362
"Yeah, it's when two girls
and a guy freak dance."

1416
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,281
Time out!

1417
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,090
"Is that why you need your inhaler?"

1418
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,242
Ladies, we're not gonna talk
about fear of marriage

1419
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,210
a few hours before
my best friend Candace gets married.

1420
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,170
- Plus, we have that last dare to complete.
- Yes.

1421
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:21,167
You, my friend, have to get a lap dance
by a hot, sweaty, steamy stripper!

1422
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,889
Ladies' night. To the strip club!

1423
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,891
<i>Now, while the girls' team
seemed to be coming together,</i>

1424
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,521
<i>my team was falling apart.
Look at us! Just stupid.</i>

1425
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,602
- Save me? I'm already saved, Zeke!
- All right, all right!

1426
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,206
Guys, stop, stop!
You're ruining my bachelor party.

1427
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,169
- He's ruining your bachelor party.
- I'm sorry.

1428
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,241
What's up with you?

1429
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,846
You guys said the Constantine Villa
should be more than $4,000 a night?

1430
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,724
Well, it is. It's 40.

1431
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,040
- $40,000?
- How, Cedric?

1432
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,122
The day that he asked me to be the
best man, I booked the villa.

1433
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,964
- For forty grand?
- Yes, for forty grand, Zeke.

1434
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,769
You want me to say it again?
You want me to make it worse?

1435
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,330
Yeah, but why would you do that?
You was drunk.

1436
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,447
You were buying the whole bar drinks.

1437
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,249
- You don't think I know what I did?
- No.

1438
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,891
Bottom line, I had everything under
control. I had the money on the table.

1439
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,042
I had Gail off my ass and everything.

1440
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,327
- We gotta cut you off. Listen, stop.
- Yeah, I'll hold it.

1441
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,848
- Just give me the damn bottle back.
- You're done. You're done.

1442
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,201
- It's my fault. How do I make it right?
- I don't know, Zeke.

1443
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,725
What do you want me to say? I don't know.

1444
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,131
World Series of Beer
Pong is at the Flamingo.

1445
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,770
- Do you play?
- Champ of my dorm, baby.

1446
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:17,441
Are you joking? You don't go to
a beer pong at a bachelor...

1447
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,443
Guys, I got it!
I know how we can get the money.

1448
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,886
Easy.

1449
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,530
- You kept the stupid flyer?
- Bennett, you're a genius!

1450
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,047
Oh, my God. This is it!
The Hustler Club. Ladies Night!

1451
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,009
They're doing a big contest
for amateur male strippers.

1452
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,445
$50,000 in cash and prizes.

1453
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,364
This is bullshit. No way
the winner takes home $50,000 in cash.

1454
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,489
- Who does this anyway?
- You're wrong, Dom, look.

1455
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,809
1st place, $25,000. 2nd place, $15,000.
3rd place, $10,000.

1456
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,366
Great, even if you win and come in first,
you still don't have enough.

1457
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,841
Guys, the first three places
add up to $50,000.

1458
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,649
- We can do this, guys.
- We?

1459
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,370
Come on, Ced. That's all right.
You've been drinking.

1460
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,687
No, Dom, I'm not tripping.
This has got nothing to do with drinking.

1461
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,489
- You're fishing.
- Zeke, you owe me!

1462
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,927
If I ask you to take your little black ass
out there and shake it,

1463
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,128
you, out of all people here,
are gonna shake it!

1464
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,090
This is not fishing, this is reality.
We can pull this off!

1465
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,806
I think we should do it. It could be fun.
You guys have really good bodies.

1466
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,565
Baby oil on black skin
always brings out all your muscles.

1467
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,165
Come on, please!

1468
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,890
- I say we go for it.
- Thank you.

1469
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,081
- I'd like to male strip.
- Yes.

1470
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,525
I'm not doing it.

1471
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,281
We're in Vegas. This is not going home with
us, guys. It's done. It's a one-time thing.

1472
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,964
- Come on, y'all.
- Can't do it, man.

1473
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,246
Dom?

1474
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,771
There's no way.

1475
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,726
Absolutely no way in hell
I'm going through with this.

1476
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,689
My mama would kill me
if she saw me in this.

1477
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,489
Help me with my fanny-pack.

1478
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,602
- How's my body look in this?
- Awful.

1479
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,042
- What are you supposed to be?
- A sexy hobbit.

1480
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,963
No, I'm a sexy caveman.

1481
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,524
Gotta be kidding me. Black Spartacus?

1482
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,840
That's a good idea.

1483
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,890
All right, fellas.
You got 15 minutes before show time.

1484
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,687
Loosen up, bro.

1485
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,810
All them ladies gonna eat
you alive out there.

1486
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,325
Better watch out, Zeke.

1487
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,567
I can't believe this is happening.
I'm actually in a strip club.

1488
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,047
Girl, please. We ain't doing anything
our men aren't doing.

1489
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,451
Except we're not gonna get caught.

1490
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,207
Look at him.

1491
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,850
Okay, the action's down here.

1492
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,603
Trust me, it's not.

1493
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,171
Follow me, ladies.

1494
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,647
Lauren! Do we have to do this?

1495
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,721
Yes!

1496
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,121
Oh, my God. It's your final dare.
Stop being a mom.

1497
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,001
Ladies!

1498
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,685
Give it up, give it up.

1499
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,084
Come on, ladies!

1500
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,649
How hard can it be to impress them?

1501
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,491
That is a bunch of drunk
and horny women out there.

1502
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,164
Wild crowd tonight, guys.

1503
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,211
Cute hobbit. Go get them.

1504
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,562
Okay. That guy is a professional.

1505
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,961
And this is amateur night, for chrissakes,
you hear me?

1506
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,280
You win by applause.

1507
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,368
Listen up! My first three
amateurs, you're on!

1508
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,169
Our outfits are gonna be better.

1509
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,011
Look at that pork chop.

1510
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,684
- Oh, shit.
- It's a setup.

1511
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,000
Man, those are ringers.

1512
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,321
<i>Competing for $50,000 in cash...</i>

1513
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,970
Take your pants off!

1514
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,122
<i>...Sexy Santa and his little helper.</i>

1515
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,245
<i>Come on, ladies!</i>

1516
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,922
<i>Come on, ladies, let me hear you!</i>

1517
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,601
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1518
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,084
<i>I said, "Are you ready?"</i>

1519
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,883
<i>Ladies, this is the moment
you've been waiting for.</i>

1520
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,644
<i>Do we have any bachelorettes in the house?</i>

1521
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,802
<i>- Any bachelorettes in the house?</i>
- Yes, over here!

1522
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,726
<i>We're only gonna bring one,
one lucky bachelorette to the stage</i>

1523
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,050
<i>for a lap dance from Santa.</i>

1524
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,605
<i>Can I get a Candace?
Do we have a Candace in the house?</i>

1525
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,406
<i>Candace, come up on stage.</i>

1526
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,487
Come on!

1527
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,730
<i>Fellas, go get Candace.</i>

1528
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,331
Go, yes, take her!

1529
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,244
<i>Give it up for Candace, ladies.</i>

1530
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,640
Good one, Lauren.

1531
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,490
Yeah, I got her good, didn't I?

1532
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,363
<i>Come on, ladies, let me hear you.</i>

1533
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,250
<i>- Come on, ladies, let me hear you!</i>
- Lauren!

1534
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,524
One more time, from the top, okay?

1535
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,321
Five, six.

1536
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,444
Five, six, seven, eight.

1537
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,086
And step. And snap it.
Get lower, like Beyoncé.

1538
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,442
Right here. You gotta do this.
This is what they want.

1539
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,250
- And then back it up.
- That's your boy.

1540
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,402
It's like you got a chance
to put it right in they face.

1541
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,324
Here it is. Took it away.

1542
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,811
You don't have to do this.

1543
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,241
We do have to do this,
because we took an oath, Michael.

1544
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,770
- Another one?
- Come on.

1545
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,765
You promised!

1546
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,724
Y'all see that right there?
It's not gonna be that bad, man.

1547
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,291
Just keep thinking $50,000.

1548
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,364
<i>Ladies, let's help her out.
Candace! Candace!</i>

1549
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,563
I know a Candace.

1550
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,085
Where are you going? One more shot!

1551
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,121
Candace!

1552
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,651
"Kansas"?

1553
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,290
Get off my girl!

1554
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:12,961
Michael?

1555
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,321
That's my girl right there.
Get your hands off me!

1556
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,170
Michael's fighting!

1557
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,081
Oh, my God.

1558
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,687
Get off her!

1559
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,490
That's my friend!

1560
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,081
Stop!

1561
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,840
Michael!

1562
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,201
I got you!

1563
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,486
Get off of her!

1564
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,681
Stay down, all right?

1565
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,761
- Really, dude?
- Shit.

1566
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,841
No!

1567
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,441
Bar fight!

1568
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,725
Michael!

1569
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,007
<i>The story you are about to see is true.</i>

1570
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,010
<i>The names have been changed
to protect the innocent.</i>

1571
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,722
<i>So the fourth quarter began with
both teams on a downward spiral.</i>

1572
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,006
Dom, slow down.

1573
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,570
Wait. Mike, wait, wait.

1574
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,331
- What?
- Wait, wait.

1575
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,005
Slow down.

1576
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,641
Look, while we're in here right now,

1577
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,570
I don't want nobody...

1578
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,561
All right. Everybody all right?

1579
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,330
- It's a door.
- Okay, listen to me.

1580
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,847
Don't nobody say nothing to nobody in here.

1581
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,843
- You keep your mouths shut.
- That's a good idea.

1582
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,081
You let me do all the talking.

1583
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,163
- Hell, no.
- What do you mean?

1584
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,924
Why would we let you do all the talking?

1585
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,003
Because I'm a Season 1 holder of <i>OZ.</i>

1586
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,606
- Yes. Have you seen it?
- I've seen it.

1587
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,205
- Have you seen Season 1?
- No.

1588
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,850
Exactly, so you don't have the knowledge.

1589
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,365
Why don't you just have my back one time?

1590
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,204
- Talk some sense into him.
- Don't talk no sense into me!

1591
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,850
Zeke's gonna blow this whole damn thing.

1592
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,930
Now look, we'll...
Oh, my God, Bennett, did you just fart?

1593
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,406
I'm nervous.

1594
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,046
Okay. You...

1595
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,884
Listen to me. Listen to me right now.

1596
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,929
On the count of three, I'm going in. Okay?

1597
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,281
One, two...

1598
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,566
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1599
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,687
Three.

1600
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,770
Everybody, listen up!

1601
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,925
What I need to know

1602
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,288
is who's the boss in here?

1603
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,566
Whatever you're thinking
right now is wrong.

1604
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,648
You know why it's wrong?
'Cause the new boss just walked in.

1605
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,401
That's right!

1606
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,403
Me and my crew.

1607
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,801
We just took this over. You got that?

1608
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,164
It's a sign of respect.

1609
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,446
Mercy, please.

1610
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,609
- Mercy.
- Mercy, please.

1611
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,405
Mercy, please. We're sorry.

1612
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,164
You want the cube, you got it.

1613
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,005
We don't need this cube.

1614
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,084
Where was y'all at?
Why you up there, Dom?

1615
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,491
<i>One thing that never occurred to any of
the players was that both teams could lose.</i>

1616
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,489
Come on, ladies, keep it moving.

1617
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,281
Let's go.

1618
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,002
I'm not mentally prepared to
be someone's bottom bitch.

1619
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,410
You know we're probably
all getting Chlamydia

1620
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,084
from sitting on these benches, right?

1621
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,330
You know you're all thinking about it.

1622
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,121
My first official photo on my wedding day

1623
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,203
is a mug shot!

1624
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,771
This is bad.

1625
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,524
This is really bad.

1626
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,963
<i>Dionne Warwick in concert.</i>

1627
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,520
How 'bout that
<i>Do You Know the Way to San Jose?</i>

1628
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,284
Yes, I do.

1629
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,568
I had the time of my life, Eddie.

1630
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,005
So did I.

1631
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,211
So...

1632
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,569
But it doesn't have to end.

1633
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,326
I could use a nightcap.

1634
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,844
Eddie. Eddie, listen.

1635
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,051
I'm an old-fashioned girl.

1636
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:18,126
I don't go in for flings and affairs
and one-night stands.

1637
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,560
I understand.

1638
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,051
So

1639
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,971
I'm gonna say good night.

1640
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,890
I'm gonna say good night, too.

1641
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,241
Good night.

1642
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,969
- Good night.
<i>- So let me get this straight.</i>

1643
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,043
You're gonna use your one phone call
to call your mother.

1644
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,690
She's gonna get us out of here fast, watch.

1645
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,801
Anything?

1646
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,770
No, my mom's phone
keeps going to voice-mail.

1647
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,963
- Who else?
- Uncle Eddie.

1648
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,922
<i>It's Loretta. Please leave a message.</i>

1649
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,321
Who am I supposed to call?

1650
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,524
Hello? Hi, could I talk to Kanye?

1651
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,330
Can you just tell him to get on the phone?

1652
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,602
No, I'm still not gonna call him Yeezus.

1653
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,410
Mom, if you get this message...

1654
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,289
What you mean, where am I at?
Where the hell are you at?

1655
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,361
Who's this?

1656
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,363
Hell, no! I know
there ain't that bitch in the background.

1657
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,522
Listen, I'm in the Clark County jail.
Come bail me out.

1658
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,600
That's a rude way to answer the phone.
I don't know anybody's number.

1659
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,121
It went to her voice-mail.

1660
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,964
I'm getting a new assistant, she's fired.

1661
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,770
Honestly, I don't know
anybody's phone number.

1662
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:17,362
It's programmed in my phone.
Who dials a number anymore?

1663
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,724
Hello? Hey, Jonah.

1664
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,961
Put Nana on the phone.

1665
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,208
She's asleep? No, don't wake her up.

1666
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,125
No, there's nothing underneath the bed.
I checked before I left. What?

1667
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,045
What do we do when we're scared?
What time is it?

1668
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,805
What time is it?

1669
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,485
It's game time!

1670
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,246
Any dogs in the house?
Any dogs in the house?

1671
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,569
Alls we need is each other!
Alls we need is each other!

1672
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,924
'Kay, feel better?

1673
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,327
All right, I love you.

1674
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,281
We're next, let's go.

1675
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,568
'Sup, Ray? So, you pretend to be Ray Lewis?

1676
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:58,167
For my kids, I'll be Ray Lewis, Jerry
Lewis, or Emmanuel Lewis if it helps.

1677
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,926
- But how do you know it's gonna work?
- I don't, I'm just winging it.

1678
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,486
My kids just want to know their dad's
got their back. It's not rocket science.

1679
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,001
- It was a good Ray Lewis.
- Thanks.

1680
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,366
I can't believe
you're making me do this right now.

1681
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,686
It's the only number you remember.

1682
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,081
- 'Cause I tried so hard to forget...
- Dial.

1683
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,170
- Not right.
- Dial.

1684
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,601
<i>Hello?</i>

1685
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,244
- Who is this and where is Gail?
<i>- She's preoccupied right now. So...</i>

1686
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,126
- Preoccupied? What...
<i>- Yeah, it means busy.</i>

1687
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,282
Wait a minute, hold on.
Say "preoccupied" again.

1688
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,441
<i>Preoccupied.</i>

1689
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,601
Is this Drake?

1690
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,682
<i>Dude, why you picking up
Gail's phone, man?</i>

1691
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,127
This is... This must be Cedric.

1692
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,885
Actually, I'll tell you one thing.
You definitely sound the way you look.

1693
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,962
That's not meant to be taken
as a compliment either.

1694
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,725
At the end of the day, you're light-skinned,
so if I hit you it's gonna show.

1695
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,963
- Listen, I'll get Gail to call you back, okay?
<i>- You won't get Gail to do anything.</i>

1696
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,963
- That's actually up for debate.
- You know, Drake, honey...

1697
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,123
- I'm gonna put the phone down now.
<i>- Put this phone down, I'm gonna...</i>

1698
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,281
Hello?

1699
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,681
<i>I'm re-thinking the bedroom chaise lounge.</i>

1700
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,962
I like the way you say chaise.
Chaise lounge.

1701
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,963
I never really noticed
how nice of a word that is.

1702
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,087
Gail!

1703
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,960
<i>If you give that light-skinned nigga
some ass... Gail, I know you hear me!</i>

1704
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,804
Break!

1705
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,850
This was all his idea, not mine.

1706
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,485
He just had to have a Vegas wedding.

1707
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,529
I wanted to stay in LA, you know.

1708
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,489
I can't believe we're still here.

1709
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,244
- Just try to relax.
- Come here. Sit down.

1710
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,481
I can't!

1711
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,927
Between us and the guys,
I'm sure somebody's already on their way.

1712
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,923
Ladies, elbows stay on the table,
no cheating.

1713
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,403
Winner! Next!

1714
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,604
- Damn, Sonia, you said you had her.
- You get her then!

1715
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,161
My fiancée is spending
her wedding day in prison.

1716
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,322
That's my fault. You
know, I'm just bad luck.

1717
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,488
I'm like Mister from <i>The Color Purple.</i>
I'm cursed.

1718
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,527
For real.

1719
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,841
I mean, maybe
I just want it too bad, you know?

1720
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,411
- Dreamed too big.
- You did.

1721
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,925
- Tried to fly too high.
- Way too high.

1722
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,445
I let you down, man.

1723
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,887
But understand something.
I was just trying to be the best best man.

1724
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,566
But, you know what, Isaac, you were right.
I am not the best best man.

1725
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,449
- I am the worst best man.
- Yeah.

1726
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,681
Let's take it a step further.

1727
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,968
- I'm the worst best man ever.
- Yeah.

1728
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,925
I kind of felt like that's where
y'all were supposed to jump in and say,

1729
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,889
- "No, Ced. It's not that bad."
- It is that bad.

1730
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,089
We're in jail. Look at us, man.
Look at my pants.

1731
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,202
Mike, I told you don't pick them pants,
so, don't put that on me.

1732
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,204
This is not how it was supposed to be.
I mean, tonight was crazy...

1733
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,850
- It was awesome.
- It was epic.

1734
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,323
I'm supposed to be getting married
in a few hours.

1735
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,165
All I wanted to do was hang with my boys.

1736
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,847
I didn't want some wild
and crazy Vegas weekend.

1737
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,766
Michael, you gotta realize that
the night is just way...

1738
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,484
Think about the after-party, too.

1739
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,768
Oh, my God, fellas. The after-party.

1740
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,763
- I can't call and cancel that now.
- Seriously?

1741
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,649
- Seriously, what?
- That's where you go?

1742
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,007
- It's one note with this dude.
- What do you mean I'm one note, Zeke?

1743
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,606
- You haven't heard one thing Michael said.
- I just lost $40,000, Zeke!

1744
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,886
- Fail.
- What does that mean?

1745
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,041
- You fail.
- Okay, you fail.

1746
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,610
- You are fired.
- I don't work for you.

1747
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,728
I just hired you and guess what?
I fired you.

1748
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,167
Cedric, just stop, man. We've had enough.

1749
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,845
It's not about you, it's about Mike.

1750
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,480
It's been about Michael and Candace
this whole weekend.

1751
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,809
- No one flew in town for you. Enough.
- I was about to say the same thing...

1752
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,685
Look, it's still your big day,

1753
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,762
and I promise you
we're gonna do everything in our power

1754
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,162
to get you out of here
and to your wedding on time.

1755
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,361
You're gonna marry her.

1756
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,327
Oh, my God.

1757
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,640
Jesus Christ!

1758
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,449
Lord have mercy.

1759
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,405
Good morning.

1760
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,411
Good morning.

1761
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,891
Wait a minute.

1762
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,564
<i>Hey, Mom, it's me, Michael.
Listen, I'm in the Clark County jail.</i>

1763
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:58,880
Oh, my God, we have to go.

1764
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,402
Wake up! Wake up!

1765
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,882
We're still in prison!
Wake up, Sonia! Wake up!

1766
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,249
Mya! Mya, wake up!

1767
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,085
No, this can't be happening.

1768
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,243
Wake up! Wake up! Guys!

1769
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,321
Bennett, wake up.

1770
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,845
Jerm, Jerm, Jerm! Guys!

1771
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,008
Wake up! Excuse me, sir.

1772
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,606
Tish, wake up!

1773
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,844
Oh, God, let me out!

1774
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,003
Please! Oh, my God, please! Let me out!

1775
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,731
I'm supposed to get married in three hours!

1776
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,207
I'm supposed to be in hair and makeup.

1777
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,367
Please!

1778
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,887
- Dom, you said you'd get us out of here.
- Yeah. We'll get out.

1779
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,371
Well, what time is it?

1780
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,443
Let's go, ladies. You just made bail.

1781
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,090
We made bail!

1782
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:40,288
Oh, my God, come on! Let's go!

1783
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:41,841
Thanks.

1784
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,280
We made bail!

1785
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,365
- We're free!
- Please don't leave me, guys!

1786
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,601
We're free!

1787
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,966
Oh, my God!

1788
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,131
- Thanks for holding the door open.
- Oh, my God.

1789
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,566
- Where's Michael?
- He's right there.

1790
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,202
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him?

1791
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,646
There's your boy right there.

1792
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,643
- Mom, I'm right here.
- Oh, my God! Michael.

1793
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,131
- They hurt you?
- No, I'm fine.

1794
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,806
- Where are your clothes?
- Thank you!

1795
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:06,961
Thank you.

1796
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,122
This is probably your fault!

1797
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,367
Oh, my God!

1798
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,322
Can you believe this?

1799
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,361
Tish?

1800
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,647
- Baby, that's not how I raised you.
- They're my friends.

1801
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,484
Oh, God, give me strength.

1802
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,641
- Michael.
- Baby, I'm so sorry.

1803
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,483
Hello! We have a wedding to get to, people!
Come on!

1804
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,845
Guys, let's go!

1805
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:42,606
Sorry!

1806
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,002
- We're almost there!
- Hurry up!

1807
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,850
Quiet!

1808
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,649
Where have you been?
I've been calling you all morning.

1809
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,643
- What's going on?
- You missed your time slot.

1810
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,848
I told you, you had to be here on time.

1811
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,726
Let me handle this.

1812
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,043
Look, miss, there has to be something
you can do to help us.

1813
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,363
Is there another location you can offer?
Anything. Please.

1814
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,966
This is our busiest month for weddings
and everything's booked solid.

1815
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,806
I've already checked. I'll keep trying,
but it's gonna take a miracle.

1816
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,203
There's gotta be something that you can do.

1817
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,691
I'm sorry.

1818
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,970
Sorry, man.

1819
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,244
Not now.

1820
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,570
You wanna do <i>Baby Boy?</i>

1821
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,370
Yeah, Jody!

1822
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,881
- You gonna clean the house?
- I'm gonna clean the house, Jody.

1823
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:15,362
- You gonna make me dinner?
- I'm gonna make you fajitas, Jody.

1824
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,445
No, it's... No, it's tacos. You make tacos.
I mean, she makes me tacos.

1825
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,605
Who cares?

1826
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,922
I just wanna be accurate
if we're gonna role play.

1827
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:27,124
But I don't like calling you Jody.
I'm sorry. It skeeves me out.

1828
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,965
And your fanny-pack
is digging into my groin.

1829
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,407
- His real name is Tyrese.
- I'm gonna call you Tyrese.

1830
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,686
- Tyrese?
- Yes.

1831
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,963
Take off your fanny-pack, Tyrese!
It's killing me!

1832
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:42,128
If there was ever a time to chill out,
now would be it.

1833
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,724
That's a great idea.

1834
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,849
Guess you girls really did get
your freak on last night?

1835
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,206
Well done.

1836
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,645
They did.

1837
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,807
Which totally explains
how everything went sideways last night.

1838
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,804
So sideways.

1839
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:06,051
You know, Jeremy,
I've been thinking about what you said

1840
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,925
about me being a drill sergeant.

1841
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,362
- Babe, I'm so sorry. I was being a jerk.
- You were absolutely right.

1842
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,762
I don't wanna force anything,
especially not a baby.

1843
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,370
I think we should just
take the pressure off ourselves.

1844
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,090
Absolutely.

1845
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:22,164
No, I love us without the pressure,

1846
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:26,086
and if a baby comes out of that,

1847
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,491
I'm ready.

1848
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,527
- Really?
- Yeah.

1849
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,729
In fact, I'm ready right now.

1850
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,081
Babe, don't you think
we should get a little sleep?

1851
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,085
Khal Drogo no need sleep.

1852
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,406
Khal Drogo need woman.

1853
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,804
I just hope you're still, you know,
of optimum ovulation, 'cause

1854
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,921
I'm feeling pretty good.

1855
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,644
No, babe. That's not how it works.

1856
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:55,770
It's like the first day of my last period
and then you gotta count a couple weeks.

1857
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,764
And your last period was five weeks ago
at Comic-Con, right?

1858
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,490
Five weeks? No, that
can't be right, can it?

1859
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,361
What?

1860
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,040
I'm a week late.

1861
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,131
You having a baby?

1862
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:15,881
Possibly.

1863
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,565
- Possibly?
- I've been stressed,

1864
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,846
so that can totally throw it off.

1865
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,843
Are you possibly having our baby?

1866
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:27,689
Is our Halle-Tiger-Jeter baby
possibly in there right now?

1867
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,125
Is my baby having my baby?

1868
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,801
Okay.

1869
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:39,125
No matter what,
I never want us to stop being us.

1870
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:41,441
Deal.

1871
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,850
<i>In relationships, you score when
you relax your demands on your spouse</i>

1872
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:53,967
<i>and yourself.</i>

1873
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,809
I should be talking to somebody,

1874
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,043
calling somebody,
using my connections, something.

1875
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,361
You got a lot of those.

1876
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,283
When were you gonna tell me, Lauren,

1877
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,283
about this big promotion in New York City?

1878
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,250
I saw it on television, Lauren.

1879
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,243
Dominic, they were not supposed
to release anything until...

1880
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,731
Well, it got leaked.

1881
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,450
Okay, baby. I can explain.

1882
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,922
You took a job in New York City
without talking to me?

1883
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,047
Dominic, it's complicated.

1884
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:24,964
Yeah, it is complicated.

1885
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,610
I got a job offer, too, Lauren.

1886
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,801
What?

1887
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:31,089
Chef Cotillard asked me to be the new
sous chef in the restaurant he's opening.

1888
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,605
That could jumpstart your career.

1889
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,603
- I was going to turn it down.
- Why would you do that?

1890
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:35,886
'Cause it's in Vegas.

1891
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,007
And the woman I love

1892
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:40,607
and I wanna spend the rest of my life with
lives in Los Angeles.

1893
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:43,206
And I just didn't think there was
anything more important than that.

1894
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,166
- I can't go through this again.
- Dominic, stop.

1895
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,850
I turned down the job, too.

1896
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,041
What?

1897
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:52,761
I called Lee Fox back
and I told him I couldn't accept it.

1898
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,881
Why?

1899
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,481
Let's see.

1900
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,929
Well, the second reason
is because the man I love

1901
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,971
and want to spend the rest of my life with
lives in LA.

1902
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,401
What's the first?

1903
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,448
I love his cooking.

1904
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,602
<i>Sacrificing to make your relationship work</i>

1905
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,843
<i>is as sweet as an off-balance fadeaway
at the top of the key.</i>

1906
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:26,845
<i>I do it all the time.
The jump shot, that is.</i>

1907
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,922
<i>Well, for Zeke it wasn't
going to be that easy.</i>

1908
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,089
<i>He was up against a full-court press.</i>

1909
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,771
<i>Nobody likes a trap.</i>

1910
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,001
Mya.

1911
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,804
I've been texting you, calling you.

1912
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,042
You couldn't just let me know
you were okay?

1913
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,281
I needed some space.

1914
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,280
You know, Mya,
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

1915
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,124
Yeah, Zeke.
I've been doing a lot of thinking, too.

1916
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,565
Please, let me get this off my chest.

1917
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,611
I want us to be together.

1918
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:52,082
But you weren't honest with me
about your past. Come on, you know it.

1919
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,322
Okay, I give you that.
But let me just explain why.

1920
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,880
I already know why.
It's the whole "Zeke the Freak" thing.

1921
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,087
You just can't let it go.

1922
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:02,642
No, Mya, it's everybody else
who can't let it go. Okay, I admit,

1923
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:06,167
it's childish and it has been
part of my identity for way too long.

1924
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,402
But, Mya, I am so past that. You...

1925
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,811
- Oh, shit. This water's cold.
- What are you doing?

1926
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,531
Listen, I learned something about myself.

1927
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,410
I'm not that guy anymore.
I don't wanna be that guy anymore, Mya.

1928
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,005
I know who I wanna be.

1929
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,923
And who's that, Zeke?

1930
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,126
I wanna be your husband.

1931
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,441
And why now?

1932
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:37,366
Mya, I have known for a while
that I can give myself to you

1933
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,920
completely, no hesitation, without regret.

1934
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,841
I've just been waiting for
the right moment to ask you.

1935
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,604
Will you please

1936
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,446
marry me?

1937
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,720
Is that an... That's an answer?

1938
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,964
- Yes.
- Yes?

1939
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,445
Yes, yes.

1940
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,841
Yes!

1941
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,611
Oh, my gosh.

1942
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,170
It's beautiful.

1943
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:22,447
You know, there's a bridge on the
other side that you could have used.

1944
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,726
<i>You score by understanding
that you can't move forward</i>

1945
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,882
<i>until you both let go of the past.</i>

1946
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,122
<i>You hear that, Gail? Let the shit go!</i>

1947
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,131
Michael?

1948
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,081
I am looking for my son.

1949
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:54,811
He's down at the concierge,
still looking for venues.

1950
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,241
You know, Candace,
maybe this is for the best.

1951
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,844
Sometimes we have to read
the signs in our lives.

1952
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,691
Now if you really loved my son
you'd go back there,

1953
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,240
finish packing and set him free.

1954
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:16,287
I am ending this conversation right now,
Miss Loretta,

1955
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:21,969
because if I say another word,
we will both regret it.

1956
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,210
You got that right. Both will regret it.

1957
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,921
What was that?

1958
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,208
How dare you talk to my fiancée like that?

1959
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:58,051
Who do you think you're talking to,
Michael Hanover?

1960
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,720
I have no idea.

1961
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,845
I would say that you're my mom,
a woman that I love

1962
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:06,402
and admire more than anyone else,
but I don't know who this woman is.

1963
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,443
Because this mean, vindictive person
that you are right now,

1964
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,885
that's not the woman that raised me.

1965
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,325
And what you need to do right now

1966
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,802
is you need to walk into that room
and apologize to Candace.

1967
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:22,841
You know damn well
I'm not gonna go in there and apologize.

1968
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:23,921
Fine.

1969
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:27,604
But please be clear,
you're no longer invited to our wedding.

1970
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,765
I love that woman

1971
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,521
and I'm gonna marry her
whether you like it or not.

1972
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,891
It had to be said.

1973
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,721
True.

1974
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,845
And, baby, I respect and love you so much
for standing up for me like that.

1975
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,562
But I can't marry you, Michael.

1976
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:04,961
Not like this.

1977
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:09,007
Baby, this is no way to
start a life together.

1978
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,281
What are you saying?

1979
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:14,684
You have to go in there
and apologize to your mother right now.

1980
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:17,809
Hell, no. She should be apologizing to you.

1981
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,530
Why are you defending her?

1982
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,364
Because I am a mother, Michael,

1983
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:27,842
and I love my son
more than anything in the world,

1984
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:31,891
and I can't even imagine
the pain I would feel

1985
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,163
if Duke told me
I wasn't invited to his wedding.

1986
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,085
So you know what? She may never like me.

1987
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:40,881
She may never think
that I am good enough for her son but,

1988
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,564
what mother does?

1989
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,641
She has her flaws, Michael, yes.

1990
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:49,564
But she is the reason that you have become

1991
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,483
the man that you are

1992
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,167
and the man that I love so much.

1993
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,924
But she should still be apologizing to you.

1994
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,923
She won't, Michael.

1995
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,606
She is a proud woman.

1996
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:09,526
Which means it is your place
to walk in there and say...

1997
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,090
I'm sorry.

1998
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,245
I was out of line.

1999
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,442
You're right, Candace.

2000
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,451
I never thought
you were good enough for my son.

2001
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:31,881
Until now.

2002
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,286
I'm sorry.

2003
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,571
Come here.

2004
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,726
<i>When you insist on the right way
instead of your own way</i>

2005
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,484
<i>nine times out of 10, you score.</i>

2006
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,051
<i>That's the thing about Vegas.</i>

2007
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:57,487
<i>When you're up, you're up,
and when you're down, you are down.</i>

2008
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,767
Brought you a little pick-me-up
before you leave, sir.

2009
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:04,329
Not in the mood, Declan. I messed up.
I messed up big this time.

2010
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,164
I had one job to do.

2011
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:09,449
"Cedric, can you be my best man?"
Couldn't even do that right.

2012
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:12,205
Even though I wasn't really asked like
that, the point is I was the best man.

2013
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,408
Instead of providing a good time,
I messed up a great time.

2014
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,565
The bachelor party, the after-party.

2015
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:20,211
That's nice. Prison.

2016
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,009
- The pillow, sir?
- I like the color.

2017
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,686
Please don't take the lamp.

2018
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,764
Everything is my...

2019
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,129
It's all my fault.

2020
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:37,284
Well, I can't deny you've been
a bit of a silly-billy, sir,

2021
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,807
but we British believe
it's always darkest before the dawn.

2022
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,649
Now, speaking of dark,

2023
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:44,804
have you thought about a night wedding?

2024
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:48,371
You know, when you've worked in this hotel
as long as I have,

2025
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,124
you get to know every nook and cranny,

2026
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:54,569
and there is one picturesque little spot
that I've always thought that

2027
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:58,087
if ever there was to be a Mrs. Declan,
I would tie the knot there.

2028
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,767
I do believe that
I might be able to arrange something.

2029
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,491
- Really?
- Perhaps you'd like to call your friends

2030
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,040
and tell them not to leave quite so soon.

2031
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,009
And in the meantime,
I've got some magic to work, sir.

2032
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,970
- Declan, you dog.
- Woof, woof, sir.

2033
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,682
<i>And just like that, I was back in the game.</i>

2034
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,047
<i>The best man with the game-saving plan.</i>

2035
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,321
Because the institution of marriage

2036
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,880
is not to be entered into
unadvisedly or lightly,

2037
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,246
but reverently and soberly.

2038
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,401
Too late for that.

2039
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:37,246
Therefore, if anyone here has reasons
why these two should not be married,

2040
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:40,005
speak now, or forever hold your peace.

2041
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,331
What y'all looking at?

2042
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,201
Proceed.

2043
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,046
Do you have the rings?

2044
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,167
The rings.

2045
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,851
- The ring. No, you put them in your pocket.
- Did I give them to you?

2046
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,081
I didn't put them in my pocket.

2047
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,640
- In your right pocket. Right there.
- No, I don't know where I put them at.

2048
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,324
I got it. I have it. I'm sorry.

2049
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,485
You really are the best best man, Ced.

2050
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,770
The couple would now
like to exchange their vows.

2051
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:19,371
With this ring, I vow
to be a loyal husband,

2052
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,885
a constant friend,

2053
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,045
and a devoted father to our son, Duke.

2054
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:32,642
I vow to love, honor,
cherish and adore you.

2055
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:35,451
Baby, I'm going to adore you forever.

2056
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,325
With this ring,

2057
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,731
I vow to love you

2058
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,562
in good times and in bad times,

2059
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,930
in sickness and in health.

2060
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,488
I promise to be in your corner

2061
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:57,283
and by your side forever and ever and ever.

2062
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,525
I heard the whole group of them went
to jail the other night. The groom...

2063
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,284
Girl, you ain't gotta shush me.
I'm just telling the truth.

2064
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,601
Stop.

2065
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,801
Okay.

2066
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,043
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

2067
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,724
You may kiss the bride.

2068
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,691
Mikey! Kiss her! Kiss her!

2069
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:24,611
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Mr. and Mrs. Michael Hanover.

2070
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,443
- Go hug your mother, boy.
- Okay.

2071
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:45,688
You did it, Michael.

2072
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:50,049
You did it and it is perfect.

2073
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:52,646
And I love you so much.

2074
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:20,090
<i>Okay, so it turns out, Vegas isn't
the worst place for couples after all.</i>

2075
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:23,164
<i>You know, maybe I should come here
with Gail sometime,</i>

2076
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:27,086
<i>when it's snowing,
or maybe when it's hailing</i>

2077
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:31,529
<i>or when it's freezing rain,
which means never!</i>

2078
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,682
Dropped your dollar.

2079
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,444
Bennett, what the hell
am I gonna do with a dollar?

2080
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,683
That's like putting a raindrop in the
ocean. Get your ass out of my face, please.

2081
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,330
All right.

2082
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,971
<i>Survey says...</i>

2083
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:59,847
Yes! $100,000!

2084
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,365
That's my dollar, I won!

2085
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,249
Yes. Thank you.

2086
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:06,642
Yes. Thank you, Steve Harvey. Thank you.

2087
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,290
That was my dollar, sir.
That was actually my dollar.

2088
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,886
No, it's mine. You gave it to me.
I put it in the machine. It's my dollar.

2089
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,121
I didn't give you shit!

2090
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,407
You gave me the dollar. Remember
the whole "raindrop in the ocean"?

2091
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,801
That is his money. We won it.

2092
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,041
It's my dollar.

2093
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,043
Bennett, you tell your
wife to shut her face!

2094
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:23,647
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Don't bump, don't bump me.

2095
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:29,329
Hello. Hi, there. Cedric! You owe me money.

2096
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,961
That's my dollar!

2097
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:14,481
You leave yet?

2098
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,085
Not quite, sir.

2099
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:18,921
What about now?

2100
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,041
Almost.

2101
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,168
You there, Declan?

2102
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,924
Not really.

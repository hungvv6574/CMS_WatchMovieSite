00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:03,794
It's nice to be missed.

358
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:05,595
I was out shopping with 'Keisha,

359
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:07,865
Shawn was breathing down my neck.

360
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:10,267
I checked him, and he said
he was there to protect me.

361
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,136
Something I need to know about, Ghost?

362
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:14,003
Me and the kids need to
get out of town for a while?

363
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:15,272
Nah, nothing like that.

364
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,973
Kid is just being over-protective,

365
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,375
taking his job too seriously.

366
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,176
I'll tell him to ease up.

367
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:21,978
I'll talk to you after work.

368
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:23,846
You meeting up with Tommy?

369
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:25,715
Headed to the club.

370
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:27,917
I don't recall you getting
up at the crack of dawn

371
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:29,786
to head out to the Wash N' Folds,

372
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:31,620
emptying quarters out the dryer.

373
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:32,989
This is different.

374
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:34,356
Yeah, looks that way.

375
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:36,225
Steady trying to figure out why.

376
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:38,227
I told you why.

377
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:41,630
Seems like you could spend the
day at home with me and Yas.

378
00:17:41,698 --> 00:17:42,999
You know, like you used to.

379
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:45,401
Everything I'm doing,
I'm doing for you, Tasha!

380
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,235
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

381
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:50,071
Everything.

384
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:59,080
So Lobos' New York distributor
is meeting with his network.

385
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:01,249
We just don't know where
or when it's happening.

386
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:03,118
My C.I. is trying to get me specifics,

387
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:04,752
but as of right now I don't have anything

388
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:06,154
beyond what I told you already.

389
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:07,956
Your C.I.'s info is bogus.

390
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:09,724
For the record, we haven't heard shit

391
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,392
about a big meeting with
Lobos' New York distributor,

392
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,028
and we've been shaking trees all over town.

393
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:14,329
Maybe you're shaking around trees.

394
00:18:14,396 --> 00:18:16,698
Or maybe this lead is just bullshit.

395
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:18,133
It's not bullshit.

396
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:19,400
It's legit intel that's been cultivated

397
00:18:19,468 --> 00:18:21,068
from a confidential informant.

398
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:22,437
It's how a real investigation is conducted.

399
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:23,904
Mm!

400
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,206
I don't need you to tell me

401
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:27,007
how an investigation is conducted.

402
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:28,376

403

405

Where are we on fatman?

406
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,783
Our opinion hasn't changed.

407
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:39,786
If in fact Lobos is looking to
switch up his current connect,

408
00:18:39,855 --> 00:18:42,223
Anibal Santalises would be
the most likely candidate.

409
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,424
He's got the infrastructure,
the relationships,

410
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:46,227
and the disposition.

411
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:48,028
We've got guys on him 24/7.

412
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:49,930
I want you two on him.

413
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,431
If he's the player you say he is,

414
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:54,701
I want Agent Medina to handle
surveillance personally.

415
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:58,171
- Saxe, you work up the warrant.
- Understood.

416
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:00,173
You stay on this distributor meeting.

417
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,709
If it's happening, we need to be there.

418
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:08,214
Ruiz won't go near Harlem.

419
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:09,815
Rolla won't fuck with the Bronx,

420
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:11,417
Anibal ain't feeling either of them.

421
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,019
We need to find some neutral ground

422
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,287
for this sit-down.

423
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:15,755
Ghost! This shit's tomorrow!

424
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,323
We need to get everything in place.

425
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,225
Yeah, we'll do it at the
Chinese spot downtown.

426
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,994
Lok Sing? What about food?

427
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,328
Rolla's on some vegan shit now.

428
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,130
This ain't no goddamn catered affair!

429
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:26,064
I put fucking food on their
table every fucking day, Tommy.

430

Motherfuckers gotta eat.

431
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,234
If one of these guys is behind these hits,

432
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,936
we need to make sure they
don't have the drop on us.

433
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,371
I don't want anybody stashing fucking gats

434
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,006
before we all get there, all right?

435
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,008
We do it okeydoke 20
minutes before game time.

436
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,510
And get the room swept.

437
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,177
I don't want anybody
listening in on our shit.

438
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,780
We need to get to the bottom of this

439
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,180
so things will go back to normal.

440
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,982
We need our shit to work smoothly

441
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,218
so we can think about other things.

442
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:50,522
What other things?

443
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,191

met a different way...

495
00:22:33,747 --> 00:22:36,483
out of our personal account
and used it to open Truth?

496

That's none of my business.

497
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:39,986
He didn't even tell me about it.

498
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:42,289
I had to find out myself.

499
00:22:42,356 --> 00:22:44,991
Look where you live,
Tasha. Look at your life.

it looks like things are
playing out pretty good for you.

502
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:51,130
So he dug in a little
deep on this club bullshit.

503
00:22:51,198 --> 00:22:53,399
So what? Doesn't change
shit about your life.

504

that you're subverting protocol

Did you tell Frankie about what Nomar said?

532

- She's gonna call in the cavalry.
- I know.

536
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,683
At this point, I'm staying
over here a few nights a week.

537
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,219
It'll be easier for me to
just leave some shit here.

538
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:59,154
- You got any room in this drawer?
- [Gasps]

539
00:24:59,222 --> 00:25:02,157
[Slams drawer]

540
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:04,326
What the hell was that?

541
00:25:04,393 --> 00:25:05,828
Um...

542
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:09,598
Angela, what the hell was that?

543
00:25:09,665 --> 00:25:11,233
Are you hiding something in that drawer?

544
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,870
- Of course not.
- Then what's the problem?

545
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:19,140
What's going on here?

546
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,642
You haven't wanted to hang out,

547
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,577
you've been distracted
when we have hung out,

548
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:24,178
and now you practically take my hand off

549
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:25,513
when I mentioned leaving
some clothes over here.

550
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,215
So what's up?

551
00:25:27,283 --> 00:25:31,152
I mean, what are we doing here?

552
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,689
Is there someone else?

553
00:25:35,758 --> 00:25:37,558
No.

554
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:39,593
There's no one else.

555
00:25:39,661 --> 00:25:41,595
Then what is it?

556
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:51,538
I'm going home.

557
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:54,475
- [Sighs]
- Greg!

558
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,512
[Door opens, slams]

559
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:22,802
We have directional cameras
set up on the street,

560
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:24,704
but we couldn't get inside.

561
00:26:24,772 --> 00:26:26,406
There's just too many people
going in and out of there

562
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:28,207
over the past 24 hours.

563
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:30,142
Did you guys hear that?
We couldn't get inside.

564
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,844
Mm-hmm.

565
00:26:31,912 --> 00:26:34,346
Control, dispatch, for a 730 switching,

secondary transmission. Stand by.

567
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:38,483
According to Valdes,

568
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:40,152
this meeting's supposed
to start in an hour.

569
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,486
Yeah, and Anibal's still up in his house

570
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:43,522
eating pints of Cherry fucking Garcia.

571
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:45,490
How the hell are they gonna
have a meeting without him?

572
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:47,526
That's because there is no meeting.

573
00:26:47,593 --> 00:26:49,862
Valdes is full of shit. [Laughs]

574
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,463
[Sighs]

575
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:55,434
Who'd you rather bang, Valdes or Frankie?

576
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,636
- Frankie don't take dick.
- I know!

577
00:26:57,704 --> 00:26:59,237
But let's just say she does.

578
00:26:59,305 --> 00:27:01,239
Or she would.

579
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:03,408
I'd go with Frankie.

580
00:27:03,476 --> 00:27:06,378
I like a broad with balls. [Laughter]

581
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:09,347
Ah, I think I'd smash Valdes.

582
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:11,415
She's always got that
expression on her face

583
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:13,818
like she's so fucking full of herself.

584
00:27:13,886 --> 00:27:15,653
I wanna see what her face looks like

585
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:17,488
when she's full of me.

586
00:27:17,556 --> 00:27:19,858
You mean half full.

587
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:21,960
Fuck you.

588
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:26,464
They're all on their way.

589
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:28,265
Time for the okeydoke.

590
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,768
Do it now.

591
00:27:38,977 --> 00:27:41,444
[Laughs]

592
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:45,482
You always land on your
feet, don't you, Kantos?

593
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:47,284
Who's the man in charge?

594
00:27:47,352 --> 00:27:48,952
You're looking at him.

595
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,422
Nobody is stupid enough to
bankroll a spot for you, Kantos.

596
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,424
Come on. Where's the boss?

597
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:57,394
He's not here.

598
00:27:57,461 --> 00:28:00,263
- What can I help you with?
- Jack shit.

599
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,733
You can help us with exactly jack shit.

600
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,835
We need to be laying eyes
on your boss right now,

601
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:07,937
or you're not gonna be
opening up your doors tonight

602
00:28:08,005 --> 00:28:10,940
or any other night.

603
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,444
I got Victor, Darien, Queso, and Jayski

604
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:17,380
patting motherfuckers
down for steel at the door.

605
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:18,981
Now as far as food goes,
I'm just having them bring

606
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:20,616
those fucking Pu Pu
platter joints with a little

607
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:22,484
something-something for everybody.

608
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:24,353
I figure Anibal's gonna be
hungry as a motherfucker.

[Phone vibrating]

610
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:26,789
You remember when he ate 25 donuts?

611
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:28,024
Yeah?

612
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:31,393
Shutting us down? Tonight?

613
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:38,333
I'm on my way, Kantos.

614
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:40,602
Drop me off at the club.

615
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,270
Where the fuck you going?

616
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:43,639
Cops saying they're gonna shut down Truth

617
00:28:43,706 --> 00:28:45,273
unless they speak to me face to face.

618
00:28:45,341 --> 00:28:46,808
You're gonna have to run
this meeting solo, Bro.

619
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,410
Are you fucking with me?

620
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,044
We're getting hit, you shut shit down.

621
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:51,979
Now we got an entire network meeting

622
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:53,748
and you're gonna go deal with
some bullshit at the club?

623

They're shutting the club down, Tommy!

624

We wash more money up in there than we do

625
00:28:58,386 --> 00:28:59,720
at every other front we got combined.

626
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,422
You want me to just fuck this off?

627
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,024
- Hell, yeah, I do.
- They want the fucking owner.

628
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:06,493
That's me. I gotta deal with it.

629
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:08,562
You can handle this on your own, Tommy.

630
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:10,730
I don't even believe this shit.

631
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:13,067
You got this.

632
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:18,805
Just don't tell them
you're turning shit back on.

633
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:20,907
Until we know who's hitting
us, we're not moving any weight.

- Go get Julio.
- No time.

635
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,613
I'll take the kid with me.

636
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,715
Hit me when you're done.

balls to drop today, kid?

and everybody on that block.

it's little Sally Kimball

I want her photographed and I.D.'d,

you don't mind if I
call you "Jimmy," do you?

656
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:32,644
See, the problem is we
know illegal narcotics

657

have been sold inside this establishment.

658
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:37,882
As you can imagine that's
a big problem for us.

Yeah, well, we're in the process

660
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:41,019
of tracking down the dealer right now.

661
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:42,654
And I'm gonna make sure
I turn him over to you

662
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:44,388
as soon as I find him,
okay? You have my word.

663

And that's great, Jimmy.

664
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:48,492
I mean, that's all a man really has, right?

665
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,094
His word.

666
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:51,695
But in this instance, I
don't think your word's

667
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:53,097
really gonna do the trick.

668
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:55,533
So what are you thinking,
Ed, two weeks or so?

669
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,435
I'm not following. What
do you mean by "Two Weeks"?

670
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:59,937
Jimmy, we gotta shut you down
for at least 14 business days.

671
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:02,505
This is totally unreasonable.
We have a business to run.

we gotta get fire in here.

everything's on the up and up.

Officer, I just told you.
Everything's up to code.

Well, sometimes it seems that way

677

partner and I some time, huh,

Oh, and hey...

684

- No shit.

- This is a restaurant?
- Yeah.

687

In our business, you try
not to use the front door.

Oh, hey, hey, hey. Sorry.

sit down, you stand behind me.

don't say a fucking word.

lay off Tasha, man.

00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,514
Yeah.

712
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:55,916
But the entrance to the
only remaining tunnel

713
00:32:55,984 --> 00:32:57,284
is on Doyers Street.

714
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,851
That's out on Chatham Square.

715
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,853
They wouldn't use that to come here.

716
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:02,656
I'm just thinking about what's
underneath this neighborhood.

717
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:06,159
Get me a blueprint for the restaurant.

718
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:18,537
Angela, the agents already
canvassed the building.

719
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,039
The entrances are covered.

720
00:33:20,107 --> 00:33:23,710
Did they walk through all the floors?

721
00:33:23,777 --> 00:33:28,981
See, there's no other entrance
to Lok Sing from the street.

722
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:33,085
But if they came from
the building behind it,

723
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:35,321
the basement could still have
a connecting door underground.

724
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,256
Street level, you'd never know

725
00:33:37,324 --> 00:33:39,858
you could get to the restaurant that way.

726
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:42,661
[Laughs] We should have known.

727
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:47,232
They're too smart to walk
through the front door.

728
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:49,034
It's a guess.

729
00:33:49,102 --> 00:33:51,603
- You're right.
- We looked.

730
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,939
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Mm-hmm.

731
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:56,341
Because it's your call. It's on you.

732
00:33:56,408 --> 00:33:58,243
And if I'm right, and they're in there,

733
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,245
then we gotta go in right now.

734
00:34:00,312 --> 00:34:01,780
We don't have shit on them.

735
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:03,215
We can't bust in there and arrest them

736
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:05,617
for just having lunch.

737
00:34:05,684 --> 00:34:07,352
I just want to see his face, Greg.

738
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:08,886
[Sighs]

739
00:34:08,954 --> 00:34:11,021
I want to see him and know who he is.

740
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:12,724
Once we I.D. that distributor,

741
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:15,993
we're this close to turning
him and getting Lobos.

742
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:25,903
[Camera shutters clicking]

743
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:27,671
We're going in.

744
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:35,946
I guess Anibal can't tell time.

745
00:34:41,118 --> 00:34:42,819
So...

746
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:44,254
how's everybody doing?

747
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:46,122
We'd be better if we had product to sell.

748
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,325
- I'm losing corners.
- Me too.

749
00:34:48,393 --> 00:34:50,360
Is that why you've been
stepping all over mine?

750
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:52,128
Those aren't my people.

751
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:53,763
Just 'cause they black don't make 'em mine.

752
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:55,631
- They flying your flag.
- Bullshit.

753
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,000
And if they say they are, they lying.

754
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,268
- Shut up.
- You're lying, Rolla.

755
00:34:58,335 --> 00:34:59,635
Kiss my ass, Ruiz.

756
00:34:59,703 --> 00:35:00,804
Shut the fuck up!

757
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:02,105
We may beef on the streets,

758
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:03,639
but in here, we're business partners.

759
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:05,241
Speaking of partners, where's yours?

760
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,876
We call this big, important meeting

761
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:09,679
and Ghost doesn't even bother to show up?

762
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:11,113
[Tires screeching]

763
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:13,081
So not only is he not getting us product...

764
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:18,020
but he doesn't respect
us enough to be here?

765
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:19,689
I got a connect in Mexico.

766
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:21,056
Says he can get us fish scale

767
00:35:21,124 --> 00:35:22,792
for half of what we're paying now.

768
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,327
Out of where?

769
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:25,961
Nueva Leon.

770
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:28,897
Ghost has been overcharging us.

771
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:31,200
We can do better.

772
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:38,173
I'm turning shit back on.

773
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:42,311
I'm gonna start moving
weight to all of you again.

774
00:35:42,378 --> 00:35:43,911
- Hey.
- [Gasps]

775
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:45,780
Let the agents clear
the room first, Angela.

776
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:47,749
You wanna go with Ruiz
and try another connect,

777
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:49,351
go right ahead.

778
00:35:53,288 --> 00:35:55,824
We're happy with you and Ghost, Tommy.

779
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:58,326
We don't do business with the Spanish.

780
00:35:58,394 --> 00:36:00,061
What do you mean, Spanish?

781
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,297
I look to you like I'm
from Spain, motherfucker?

782
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:05,799
- When you come back...
- FBI! Let me see your hands!

783
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:07,969
On your knees 'cause our shit is purer,

784
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:09,837
we're gonna charge you double, Ruiz.

785
00:36:09,905 --> 00:36:12,806
- Don't move!
- [Overlapped shouting]

786
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:18,078
Spring rolls up in this spot
ain't got shit on Lok Sing.

787
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:21,114
In fact, I'd consider
sucking a dick right now

788
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:22,816
for some of them Lok Sing green beans.

789
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:24,451
- Oh, hell, no.
- [Laughs]

790
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,720
Why you switch up the spot for
the meeting at the last second?

791
00:36:26,788 --> 00:36:29,723
Can never be too careful.
Always keep 'em guessing.

792
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,157
Can I get a fork, please?

793
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:34,794
We gotta know who's been hitting us.

794
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:36,496
Where the fuck is Anibal?

795
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:38,298
- [Sirens blip]
- How long?

796
00:36:38,366 --> 00:36:39,900
It could be one or two hours,

797
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,234
three at the most.

798
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:42,835
And it was just the cut to the neck?

799
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:45,805
That's all she wrote. Looks professional.

800
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:47,440
Excuse me for a minute.

801
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,842
Who are you, and why the fuck
are you in my crime scene?

802
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,176
- DEA.
- Fuck off.

803
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:52,512
This is NYPD business.

804
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:53,946
We were surveilling Santalises

805
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:55,515
for involvement with Felipe Lobos.

806
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:58,117
You mean you were right
outside when this happened?

807
00:36:58,184 --> 00:37:00,185
Wow.

809

I think I'll handle it from here.

- Detective...
- Beat it!

811
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:09,528
Let's go.

- Where you at?

813
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:12,898
This sit-down should've ended a while ago.

00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:15,200
Hit me back.

815
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:16,868
What sit-down?

816
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:19,771
Just trying to find Tommy. Hey.

817
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,073
Tommy went to a sit-down alone?

818
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:23,542
No, he took Shawn with him.

819
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,243
Shawn?

820
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:27,446
Since when do Tommy and
Shawn do meetings without you?

821
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:29,848
Tommy needs to start stepping it up.

822
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:32,183
Why? You going somewhere?

823
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:36,154
No, I'm not going anywhere, Tasha.

Anibal is dead,

853
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:07,274

00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:10,244
is so anxious to take your position

Of course.

out of deference to you,

was to figure out who's robbing us.

1
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:11,684
You recognize the name Simon Stern?

2
00:00:11,768 --> 00:00:13,886
He's one of the biggest
nightlife investors in New York.

3
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:15,384
You got some fine-ass-looking girls

4
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:16,843
serving drinks in there, by the way.

5
00:00:16,843 --> 00:00:19,163
There was this one red hair,
tall... what's her name?

6
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:21,644
Her name is don't touch the
merchandise, motherfucker.

7
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:23,646
Not everybody understands us, Jamie.

8
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:24,831
I'm not going anywhere, Tasha.

9
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:26,808
I'm stuck here, right where you want me.

10
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:29,005
We have us a meeting.
I sit across the table.

11
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:31,077
I look all those motherfuckers in the eye,

12
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,466
and I'll find out who's
hitting me once and for all.

13
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,788
Until then, no one gets product.

14
00:00:35,788 --> 00:00:37,485
The Lobos' New York distributor

15
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:38,666
is meeting with his network.

16
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,579
So not only is he not getting us product,

17
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,664
but he doesn't respect
us enough to be here.

18
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:44,166
FBI! Let me see your hands!

19
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:45,442
Why you switch up the spot for the meeting

20
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:46,230
at the last second?

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,503
You can never be too careful.

22
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:49,839
Where the fuck is Anibal?

23
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:55,428
I never stopped thinking
about you all these years.

25
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,802
Hey, hey.

26
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,305
Oh, yeah?

27
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:24,213
It feels like we're 15 again

28
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:26,962
sneaking out of my parents' apartment.

29
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,664
It ain't like that.

30
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:31,050
My driver's parked in the back.

31
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:34,303
Of course, just like when we were 15.

32
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:37,640
I could've taken a cab.

33
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:40,342
What kind of guy do you think I am?

34
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:45,731
- Um, Angie, are we...
- What?

35
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:48,017
Okay, I guess.

36
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:55,825
Better than okay, I think.

37
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:16,679
Good night, Angie.

38
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,681
Good night, Jamie.

39
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:43,672
♪ Stand out a mile, stand out a mile ♪

40
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:46,592

42
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:55,100
Watch that turn now, Raina, okay?

43
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:56,719
- Mm-hmm.
- ♪ You're never ♪

44
00:04:56,803 --> 00:05:03,058
♪ fully dressed without a smile ♪

45
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:04,476
Hold that out a little.

46
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:05,811
- You sound really good.
- Thank you.

47
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:09,315
And you will, too, if you do what I said.

48
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,816
Good morning, sleepyhead.

49
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:12,318
Morning.

50
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:13,786
I didn't hear you come in last night.

51
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,321
Yeah, the count was off,

52
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:17,456
so we stayed to make sure it was right.

53
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,541
And then y'all woke me up
with those beautiful voices.

54
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:20,659
You keep singing like that,

55
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:21,994
I guarantee you'll get the lead.

56
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:23,996
The fifth graders never get it.

57
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,581
Yeah, but, baby girl, they never seen

58
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:27,333
a fifth grader like my Raina St. Patrick.

59
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,919
You come from good stock,
girl, you know hear me, huh?

60
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:31,887
Your daddy's looks and your mama's voice.

61
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:34,056
Mm-hmm. Whatever, negro.

62
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:36,592
- Gross.
- "Gross"?

63
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:37,843
- Give me some sugar.
- No, no.

64
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:39,645
Wait, wait. You trying to run...

65
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:41,430
Mm.

66
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:43,766
- Mwah. I love you.
- Love you too.

67
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:45,434
- Have a good day at school.
- Okay.

68
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:46,936
All right.

69
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:51,440
Keep practicing that song.

70
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:02,275
_

71
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:08,958
So we got fuckups all around, don't we?

72
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:12,795
The meeting information
from Nomar Arcielo was bogus.

73
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:15,297
And I take full responsibility
for that, Frankie.

74
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:17,016
But it's no worse than the potential key

75
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,802
to the whole investigation getting murdered

76
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:22,521
while you two idiots were sitting outside.

77
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:25,107
Saxe, what were you doing there anyway?

78
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:26,892
You were supposed to write the warrant,

79
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:29,528
not go out on a field trip.

80
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:32,064
And you distracted Agent
Medina from good surveillance.

81
00:06:32,148 --> 00:06:34,867
All due respect, Frankie I
hardly think I'm to blame.

82
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:36,485
You're right.

83
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,704
There's enough blame to go around.

84
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:41,623
But the question is,
where do we go from here?

85
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:44,326
If you were right

86
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:47,329
and Anibal was the distributor
Lobos was unhappy with,

87
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:49,882
then Lobos had the biggest
motive to call a hit.

88
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:52,084
If we find Anibal's
killer, there's a chance

89
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:53,802
we could connect Lobos directly.

90
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:56,338
We're gonna need NYPD cooperation for that.

91
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,756
Good luck with that.

92
00:06:57,841 --> 00:06:59,925
The detective on the case, Meredith Haines,

93
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,510
is a power-tripping bitch.

94
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:02,761
Takes one to know one, Saxe.

95
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:04,179
I'll talk to Detective Haines.

96
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,815
Let you know what I find out.

97
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,350
I'll drive you to the precinct.

98
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:09,935
I've got some friends over there.

99
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,354
If Detective Haines is
as prickly as they say,

100
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:15,357
then I'm better off going alone
so we can talk woman-to-woman.

101
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:16,692
You want to try calling Nomar?

102
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:18,610
He's not responding to our calls.

103
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:20,696
Yeah, okay. But as some
point, we need to talk

104
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:22,531
about the dresser situation
from the other night.

105
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:24,083
Later, okay?

106
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:31,373
We're gearing up for my high holy day.

107
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:33,375
That some kind of religious shit?

108
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,511
No.

109
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:37,046
We're celebrating the day I got made

110
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,183
born into the mighty
Soldado Nation 25 years ago.

111
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:43,102
Boys in my crew are getting
snake tattoos on their arms

112
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:46,688
so they can honor me, Vibora.

113
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:49,274
Dos decades in the game.

114
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,526
Always seems like guys like us

115
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,861
should be able to not
look over our shoulder.

116
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:55,030
That's why Anibal's
death came as a surprise

117
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:56,281
to me and my partner.

118
00:07:58,868 --> 00:07:59,701
Can't say it did the same for me.

119
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:01,653
Because you made the order?

120
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,039
Because he's straight up fat, man.

121
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:05,574
You ever see that motherfucker eat?

122
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:09,745
I'm a businessman like you.

123
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:11,497
I don't wish death on any man,

124
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:13,582
except if it benefits my pockets.

125
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,751
Maybe you're trying to
take over the Tainos' turf.

126
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:18,087
I got enough trouble
maintaining my own territory.

127
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:19,304
I don't want to expand.

128
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,422
What about that shit you were talking

129
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:22,975
at the Chinese spot, about another connect?

130
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:24,843
I know a guy who knows a guy.

131
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:25,978
But it's not your product's quality.

132
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:27,596
_

133
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,314
You're here to accuse
me of something or not?

134
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,816
Because not too long ago,
you came to me for help,

135
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,519
and I strapped your crew up.

136
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:37,689
_

137
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:40,442
Reason I'm here, papa.

138
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:42,327
_

139
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:44,913
Yeah? _

140
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:46,448
You'd open up that damn pipeline again

141
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,117
like you did for Rolla.

142
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:50,369
_

143
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:52,538
But I haven't seen shit.

144
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:59,595
Give me a couple days to get
some things back in order.

145
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,131
You'll be flying high again.

146
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:07,302
_

147
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:10,556
Vibora.

148
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,608
Hmm.

149
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:24,069
For a minute there, you had me thinking
you weren't gonna kill him.

150
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:25,785
Motherfucker straight up lied to my face,

151
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:26,872
didn't he, Tommy?

152
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:29,193
Knowing damn well he met
with Lobos about stepping up.

153
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,697
Told you it was Ruiz all along.

154
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:32,142
Yeah, except when you said it was Anibal.

155
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:33,004
Except then. I don't care.

156
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:34,437
Now I just want to kill a motherfucker.

157
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,855
Yo, Shawn. You ready to
finally get your dick wet?

158
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:38,885
- Tommy. - No, it's cool, Uncle G.
I want to help.

159
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:42,615
Did I ask you anything,
Shawn, huh? He ain't ready.

160
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,856
Hey, the kid handled himself
at the meeting, Ghost.

161
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:47,614
Ain't it time we let him step
it up like his dad did with us?

162
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:51,513
Kid ain't ready.

163
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:53,982
All right, get out of here.

164
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:55,942
What's wrong with you
man, huh? What's wrong?

165
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:58,573
How's he gonna get ready?
Driving you around ain't prepping him

166
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:00,677
- for no real shit.
- Ruiz is too hard of a target.

167
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:04,131
Shawn's green. He'll get himself killed. How
the fuck we supposed to explain to Kanan,

168
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:06,813
who gets out in a year, that he's
coming home to no money and no son?

169
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,771
Fine. I'll do it fast and clean.

170
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:09,645
Ruiz won't know what hit him.

171
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:11,833
Nah, I don't want any of our hands
getting dirty on this, okay?

172
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:15,003
We need to outsource, so we have plausible
deniability in case something goes wrong.

173
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:18,090
I do it, ain't shit gonna go wrong.
The important thing is it stops, all right?

174
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:20,778
The streets don't need to know we did it,
so long as it gets done.

175
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:22,358
Fine. You want to blow loot. Fuck it.

176
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:24,930
I'll just call in the dreads.
Good.

177
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:29,478
What? -I just can't help but think none of this
shit would be doing down if Kanan were here.

178
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:33,105
If Kanan were here, we'd
still be working the corner.

179
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,474
Cheer up.

180
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:37,559
Let the Jamaicans do their thing, man, huh?

181
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:40,511
It'll all be over, it
can go back to business

182
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,897
- the way you want it.

183
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:45,450
Right?
Right.

184
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,857
I just want to talk about
Anibal Santalises's murder.

185
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,911
Give me what you have, and I'll give you

186
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:58,747
whatever federal resources
you need to clear this case.

187
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:03,752
And you'll get all the credit.

188
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:11,426
The victim's throat was slashed,

189
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:15,480
and he was gouged in his chest
in the shape of a trident.

190
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:17,599
Calling card of the Soldado Nation.

191
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,518
It's damn near impossible to confirm.

192
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:22,404
Soldados don't so much
as talk to outsiders.

193
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:25,157
And what if I can get you an insider?

194
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:29,361
I'm listening.

195
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:31,747
I'll just need your help finding him.

196
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:41,006
Why am I not surprised to see you here?

197
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,626
I could've gone to any of
128 nightclubs in Manhattan.

198
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,295
Yet you wound up right here at Truth.

199
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:48,013
My clients signed off on your nightclub

200
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:50,299
when they found out what I
was getting on the back end.

201
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,600
What exactly is that?

202
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:53,518
Have your people draw up a contract.

203
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:55,137
You're getting all four parties.

204
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:56,638
You should know that Simon Stern

205
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:58,473
fired his entire event-management team

206
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:00,475
when he found out that he was underbid.

207
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:02,311
You're not making any friends.

208
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:04,813
It's not personal, just business, Cynthia.

209
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:06,315
For now.

210
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,118
Congratulations, James St. Patrick.

211
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:12,070
Every boldface name in town is gonna walk

212
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:13,989
through those doors this season.

213
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:15,157
Well played.

214
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:17,709
Thank you, Cynthia Sheridan.

215
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:21,380
I look forward to working together.

216
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,686
I'd like to order some soup.

217
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:48,657
Right now the only thing
we have is fish tea.

218
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:52,160
I had my heart set on some mannish water.

219
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,449
Sorry. We out of that at the moment.

220
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:02,371
But why you don't look at the menu and see

221
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,005
if there's anything else you want to order?

222
00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:22,441
I was hoping to get some
in the next two days.

223
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,445
Let me talk to me son,

224
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,947

She's also going out for Annie.

That must be Suzie's fault.

00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,500
She played the female lead last year too,

00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:50,385
even though she was only in fifth grade.

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,422

No.

252
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:19,841
It's not polite to make a lady drink alone.

253
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,979
I just want to remember
everything that happens tonight.

254
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:26,515
Aren't you presumptuous?

255
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:31,236
What line of work are you in, Carlos?

256
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,687
I'm a salesman.

257
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:35,574
Oh. So what do you sell?

258
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:38,276
I sell people...

259
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:42,364
a fantasy.

260
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:49,371
That feels a little too real to me.

261
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:51,172
Hey.

262
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:53,542
Come on, don't do that.

263
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:58,213
Stay here...

264
00:15:58,264 --> 00:15:59,714
in the moment...

265
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,600
you and me.

266
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:06,304
Jamie?

267
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,390
Who's Jamie?

268
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:10,442
Have we been here before?

269
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:15,363
I didn't think you'd remember.

270
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:22,317
I saved all my money
to bring you to the city

271
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:25,153
and then could barely afford
the tokens to get back.

272
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:36,164
I was going crazy...

273
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:40,619
trying to decide the
right moment to kiss you.

274
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,337
How about now?

275
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,390
Why is our fridge the first place you start

276
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:03,808
every time you come over here?

277
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:05,477
It's hard out here for a pimp.

278
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,362
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, don't start.

279
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:09,648
You know how Ghost gets about his junior's.

280
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:11,566
He was supposed to meet me here at 9:00.

281
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:13,985
He's late. It's his fucking fault.

282
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,122
You noticing Ghost has
been M.I.A. a lot lately?

283
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:24,579
- Can you get more of this shit?
- How much do you need, boy?

284
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:27,082
It's just...

285
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,667
I got a girl.

286
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:30,919
I was thinking maybe I'd
bring her by for dinner.

287
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,173
Something ain't right.

288
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:36,675
You must be coming down with something

289
00:17:36,726 --> 00:17:39,344
if you claiming girls, let
alone want to bring 'em by here.

290
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:41,179
I like this chick, and I
want to bring her to dinner

291
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,180
to see you what you think.

292
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:44,182
Stop making such a federal case of it.

293
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:46,101
You want me to pick
your girl for you, Tommy?

294
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:47,318
What, I'ma let my mom do it?

295
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:50,021
Look, T, I respect your opinion.

296
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:52,657
If you like Holly, that means a lot.

297
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:55,276
All right.

298
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:57,245
Bring her by tomorrow.

299
00:17:57,329 --> 00:18:00,031
I'll fry up some chicken or something.

300
00:18:00,116 --> 00:18:01,583
Ooh! Like old times.

301
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,535
Like old times you eating up all my food,

302
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:05,837
- that's what it is.
- Mmm, mmm.

303
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:21,052
What's wrong, Angie?

304
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,305
Come on, talk to me.

305
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,057
We've been friends since the eighth grade.

306
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:27,108
If you can't tell me what's on your mind,

307
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,310
we got real problems.

308
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:31,646
I want to know what we're doing here.

309
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:33,982
- Are we just fucking?
- Is that what you think?

310
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:36,117
- I don't know what to think.
- Maybe don't think.

311
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,486
Don't say that. Men always say that.

312
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:41,656
Look, last night was last night.

313
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:45,410
But if this happens again,
then I'm making a choice...

314
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:54,669
I am making a choice...

315
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:59,007
right here, right now...

316
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:01,092
with you.

317
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:10,211
What is this?

318
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:12,130
The wing?

319
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:14,382
That's something I got a long time ago.

320
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,251
I wanted to fly away...

321
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:19,387
escape.

322
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,556
I'm sure you wouldn't understand.

323
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,059
No, I understand.

324
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:30,348
I missed a lot, being away.

325
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:46,197
Oh, you're better at that now.

326
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:48,616
Some things have changed.

327
00:21:06,802 --> 00:21:08,853
What's all this?

328
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,391
You know that show Hoarders?

329
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:15,727
That's my mom.

330
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:18,529
It's her oldies and goodies collection.

331
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:21,532
I took it out her basement to spin.

332
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:23,067
On what, a record player?

333
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:24,736
Hell, yeah.

334
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,989

behind these bullshit charges.

357
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:54,824
_

358
00:22:54,843 --> 00:22:56,160
Mami.

359
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:57,996
You didn't return my calls.

360
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:01,215
What's a girl to do?

361
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,801
It's that damn coverage plan I'm on.

362
00:23:03,836 --> 00:23:05,670
Phone company's a bitch.

363
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:08,589
So are you for feeding me
fake intel about that meeting.

364
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:10,675
Nah, there was a meeting.

365
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,427
The place got switched at the last moment.

366
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:15,346
Of course it did.

367
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:17,432
We're done here.

368
00:23:17,516 --> 00:23:19,517
They hashed that shit out.

369
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:23,404
Now Vibora's gonna hook up
with the distributor again,

370
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:26,357
restock our drug supply.

371
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:28,076
Fucking time.

372
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,527
So you're serious?

373
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:31,496
That meeting actually happened?

374
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,531
That's what I said, isn't it?

375
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,284
You got trust issues, bruja.

376
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:37,635
See someone about that.

377
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,470
We need to get you close to Ruiz

378
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:41,639
so you can identify this distributor.

379
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:44,392
I'm not high enough on the
depth chart to find out.

380
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:45,643
Bullshit, you were high enough

381
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:47,345
to set up that meeting with Lobos.

382
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:50,648
And when that went south, I did too...

383
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:52,350
in terms of juice.

384
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:56,237
Well, here's your chance to get it back.

385
00:23:57,022 --> 00:23:58,022
According to our files,

386
00:23:58,107 --> 00:24:00,775
Ruiz's high holy day is coming up.

387
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:02,743
I'm going to the party.

388
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:06,447
But I won't get anywhere
near the inner circle.

389
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:09,450
I got you here, didn't I?

390
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:12,036
Let me worry about getting you in there.

391
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:17,758
It's okay, baby.

392
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:19,293
It's all right.

393
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:21,262
It's okay.

394
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:22,463
It's okay.

395
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,298
What happened?

396
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:25,683
The school called.

397
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,635
Raina didn't get the part in the play.

398
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:29,687
I don't know why they didn't pick me.

399
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:31,305
I did my best.

400
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:32,690
Come here, baby girl.

401
00:24:32,774 --> 00:24:34,225
It's totally unfair that's why.

402
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,394
Raina was the best singer on that stage,

403
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:37,645
and they gave it to the little white girl.

404
00:24:37,729 --> 00:24:39,030
Tasha.

405
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:40,031
They should've picked her,

406
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:41,449
not Suzie Spencer.

407
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:43,117
I know how disappointing it is to work hard

408
00:24:43,152 --> 00:24:44,702
for something and not get it.

409
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:47,288
She busted her ass on this,
and they took it from her.

410
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:50,124
Everything you want in life
you don't get the first time.

411
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,742
You got to keep going for it.

412
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:54,045
- You think?
- I know.

413
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:55,663
You keep practicing,

414
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:57,632
and next year you will be
the lead, I'm sure of it.

415
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,167
Okay, daddy.

416
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:01,335
That's my girl. Give me some sugar.

417
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,671
I know you're not gonna
run from me this time.

418
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:10,011
- Her school made a decision.
- And it was the wrong decision.

419
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:11,262
We need to do something about it.

420
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:13,481
And that happens sometimes in life.

421
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:15,099
We're supposed to prepare her for that.

422
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:17,185
We can't go around correcting
every goddamn wrong!

423
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:19,187
And we can't roll over
and chalk up everything

424
00:25:19,271 --> 00:25:20,855
as a loss either.

425
00:25:20,906 --> 00:25:23,608
I'm not letting Raina go
through the same shit I did.

426
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:25,109
Just because you didn't
make it into Destiny's Child

427
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:27,161
don't mean somebody's
out to get our daughter.

428
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:32,633
Fuck you, Ghost.

429
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:34,001
You know what my mother did to me,

430
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:35,720
telling me I would never make it.

431
00:25:35,804 --> 00:25:38,339
I gave up because of her.

432
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,258
This ain't about your singing career.

433
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:41,759
It's about Raina, and I'm
not telling her to give up

434
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:43,094
- the opposite.
- Mm.

435
00:25:43,178 --> 00:25:45,513
But she's not always
gonna win, and that's life.

436
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:47,148
You need to let this shit
go, okay? Leave it alone.

437
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:48,516
You hear me? Leave it alone.

438
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:54,188
Are we clear?

439
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:58,025
We're having dinner with
Tommy and his girl tonight.

440
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,528
Just make sure you're here.

441
00:26:00,612 --> 00:26:02,747
Tommy got a girlfriend? Since when?

442
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:07,585
Let's go, Shawn.

443
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:20,995
So how'd it go at the meeting with Tommy?

444
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,415
It was good... being out in the field.

445
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,201
Yeah.

446
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,119
Listen, man, I know you
want to get in the action

447
00:26:28,204 --> 00:26:31,172
- and be like your old man.
- No doubt.

448
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,625
I get it. Felt the same way.

449
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,543
Your pops brought me in the game,

450
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,462
schooled me on everything.

451
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:39,714
Make sure your word is your bond.

452
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,350
Never turn your back on your friends

453
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:44,052
and most importantly, know when to talk

454
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,387
and when not to.

455
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:53,228
God gave you two ears and
one mouth for a reason.

456
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,063
You volunteered to take a man's life today.

457
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,447
Is that what you want?

458
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,533
I'm ready to step up.

459
00:26:58,567 --> 00:26:59,984
If you want the street
side of the business,

460
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:03,571
it'll happen, but not until I say so.

461
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:06,207
Understood?

462
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:07,825
Yes, sir.

463
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,079
Because before you get out there,

464
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:12,580
it'll be like your dad.

465
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,582
I got to be sure, 100% sure,

466
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,885
I can trust you with my
life, with everything.

467
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,221
I got your back, Uncle G...

468
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,092
100%.

469
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,269
You like this fabric?

470
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,572
Yeah, it's tight. You getting another one?

471
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:39,524
No. You are.

472
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,168
Acting the part is one thing, Shawn.

473
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,620
You got to look the part as well.

474
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,018
Vibora Ruiz has a thing
for poisonous snakes, huh?

475
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,470
Been caught smuggling illegal species

476
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:13,141
into the country a couple times.

477
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,642
You know anyone over at Ice?

478
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:17,528
Yeah, I got a customs guy. Why?

479
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,364
Nomar confirmed the meeting

480
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,482
with the distributor actually happened.

481
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:24,295
The guy we've been
looking for is still alive.

482
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,598
And I'm gonna get my C.I. to I.D. him.

483
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:30,218
That guy just screwed over
the whole goddamn department,

484
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:31,469
and you're talking about using him again?

485
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:32,937
Next to you, I got the biggest hard-on

486
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:34,188
for Lobos in this place.

487
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:36,224
And this is the best lead either of us has.

488
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:39,027
So let's pool our
resources and bust his ass.

489
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:40,945
All right.

490
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,613
If I do this for you,

491
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:45,283
maybe you can clear something up for me.

492
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:46,617
Sure.

493
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:48,569
How long have you been fucking Agent Knox?

494
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,071
Excuse me?

495
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:52,073
I'm an undercover agent
trained to read people.

496
00:28:52,124 --> 00:28:55,159
Obviously there's something
going on between you two.

497
00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:57,078
There's nothing going on.

498
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:59,163
Whatever.

499
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:03,885
Melissa, have you seen Holly?

500
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,970
She called in sick, again.

501
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:07,755
I guess she thinks 'cause
she's fucking the boss,

502
00:29:07,806 --> 00:29:09,057
she doesn't have to follow the rules.

503
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:10,391
Wait. What?

504
00:29:10,426 --> 00:29:12,677
Not the black one the white guy, Tommy.

505
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:14,896
You ask me, he's an asshole.

506
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,099
No argument from me there.

507
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,601
Boss wants us starting the
secret V.I.P. entrances tonight,

508
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:21,652
and I need her here.

509
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:23,104
I got to call her.

510
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:26,274
Chasing down these fucking employees.

511
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,160
I'm sorry, sir.

512
00:29:29,244 --> 00:29:30,945
We're not open to the public yet.

513
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:32,947
It's okay.

514
00:29:35,117 --> 00:29:36,868
I'm not the public.

515
00:29:36,952 --> 00:29:38,870
Mr. Stern.

516
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:43,508
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

517
00:29:43,592 --> 00:29:44,542
You haven't gotten a shower yet?

518
00:29:44,626 --> 00:29:45,793
Babe, we got plenty of time.

519
00:29:45,878 --> 00:29:47,261
They're gonna be here any minute.

520
00:29:47,296 --> 00:29:48,796
You're the reason why they say black folks

521
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:50,131
are always late.

522
00:29:50,215 --> 00:29:51,516
No, they say black folks are always late

523
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,384
'cause we always late.

524
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:11,652
Hell, no.

525
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:13,955
Not tonight.

526
00:30:27,336 --> 00:30:28,669
Hello.

527
00:30:28,754 --> 00:30:30,171
Good evening, Mrs. St. Patrick.

528
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:32,590
It's Joshua Kantos from Truth.

529
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:34,675
I left a message for the
boss on his cell phone,

530
00:30:34,726 --> 00:30:36,227
but it's very important that I talk to him.

531
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:38,229
- Is he available?
- He's in the shower.

532
00:30:38,313 --> 00:30:40,348
I'll have him return when he gets a minute.

533
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,734
This is very important.

534
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:46,687
It always is, Kantos.

535
00:30:46,772 --> 00:30:49,240
- I'll be sure to let him know.
- Please, Mrs. St. Patrick.

536
00:30:49,324 --> 00:30:51,659
It's very important that I get a hold

537
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:53,694
all right, babe, the doorman just buzzed.

538
00:30:53,745 --> 00:30:55,997
Tommy and his date are on their way up.

539
00:30:56,031 --> 00:30:57,665
By the way, you see my cell phone?

540
00:30:57,699 --> 00:31:00,334
Oh, yeah. It's right here, babe.

541
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:02,086
- Oh, cool.
- You get the door, okay?

542
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:03,371
I got to go freshen up a bit.

543
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:05,256
All right.

544
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:10,628
- Hey, Tommy.
- What's up, G?

545
00:31:13,182 --> 00:31:14,715
I think y'all know each other.

546
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:17,301
Holly... Holly from the club.

547
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:19,554
Nice to see you, Mr. St. Patrick.

548
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:21,305
Oh, you can call him James.

549
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,057
Hello.

550
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:24,942
- My lovely wife.
- Hi. I'm Tasha.

551
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:29,530
Hi. Tommy told me all about you.

552
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:31,616
I had no idea Mr. St. Patrick,

553
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,285
the big boss, was actually the brother

554
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:35,903
he's always talking about.

555
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:39,240
Yo, it's time to drink. I'll pour.

556
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:41,209
T, why don't you show Holly around.

557
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:42,743
I'll take your coat.

558
00:31:52,804 --> 00:31:55,256
Holy shit.

559
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,926
This thing is bigger than my apartment.

560
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,065
Is this Louis Vuitton?

561
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:06,434
This thing costs, like, $1,000.

562
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:08,102
2,000.

563
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:11,606
My husband brought it back
from his last business trip.

564
00:32:11,657 --> 00:32:13,157
That's what I want.

565
00:32:13,242 --> 00:32:14,942
That is real love.

566
00:32:15,027 --> 00:32:17,278
It's not about the gift.

567
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:19,113
It's about the fact that
he's thinking of you,

568
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:20,998
and he thinks you're worth the money.

569
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,334
I'm sure Tommy will get
you anything you ask for.

570
00:32:23,418 --> 00:32:25,119
Tommy wouldn't know that bag

571
00:32:25,203 --> 00:32:27,004
if I hit him in the face with it.

572
00:32:28,957 --> 00:32:31,592
You guys got it made.

573
00:32:31,627 --> 00:32:33,961
Yeah, I guess so.

574
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,300
Nice.

575
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:41,135
The good stuff. Cheers.

576
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:43,054
Cheers.

577
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:48,643
I am really impressed
with how you bounced back,

578
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:49,977
got your own club.

579
00:32:50,062 --> 00:32:51,112
I do have one question for you.

580
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:53,981
How did you raise the money so fast?

581
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:56,867
I'm only a limited partner here, sir.

582
00:32:56,952 --> 00:32:59,654
It's James St. Patrick's money.

583
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:01,072
But you're the reason this place

584
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:03,124
is turning out to be so successful.

585
00:33:03,158 --> 00:33:04,742
I couldn't say that.

586
00:33:04,826 --> 00:33:06,911
For a guy who's never been in the business,

587
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:08,212
James knows what he's doing.

588
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:10,631
We're full every night,
extremely tight door,

589
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,917
and once they're in, every kind of customer

590
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:14,635
gets specific treatment.

591
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,171
The drinks they ordered last
time, the booth they loved,

592
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:18,923
the waitress they wanted to fuck.

593
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:21,676
Well, you'd know about that, wouldn't you?

594
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,808
We've got a great system here, sir.

595
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:25,810
Seeing as it's just the two of us,

596
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:28,095
what is St. Patrick's deal?

597
00:33:28,146 --> 00:33:30,264
Where's he from? What's his background?

598
00:33:30,315 --> 00:33:34,101
I tried looking into him
myself and came up empty.

599
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:36,737
What did he do before this?

600
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:41,108
Remember JSP and Tommy-Toms?

601
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,078
Oh, please tell me Tommy-Toms
was not your stage name.

602
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:46,280
It was the '80s. Everybody had two names.

603
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:49,283
- Lisa Lisa, Marky
Mark. - And Tommy-Toms.

604
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:51,869
That shit sounded like
a bad Chinese restaurant.

605
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:54,371
You're not gonna sit there
and just blaze us up like that?

606
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:58,342
Yo, let's bust out a verse, B.

607
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:02,046
My husband used to always do
this rap about how we first met.

608
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,714
Go for it, Tommy.

609
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,683
I don't remember the words.

610
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:07,101

611
00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:09,637

Oh, come on, man, you know I

620
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:28,322
Boo.

621
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:29,657
Party pooper.

622
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,659
- That's my husband.
- Fine.

623
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,662
If you ain't gonna rap,
I need you to work a bit.

624
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:48,092
That club sure keeps them busy, huh?

625
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:51,428
Like you couldn't imagine.

626
00:34:51,513 --> 00:34:53,147
Mind if I you use your bathroom?

627
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:56,016
Sure. It's right down the hall.

628
00:35:04,326 --> 00:35:07,862
We're all set with the
Jamaicans for tomorrow.

629
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:10,364
Didn't I tell you not
to fuck the merchandise?

630
00:35:10,415 --> 00:35:12,449
Let's get one thing straight from jump.

631
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:14,502
You don't tell me shit.
I'm not a fucking child.

632
00:35:14,536 --> 00:35:15,870
You're acting like one

633
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:18,205
bringing breezies over to
my house for show-and-tell?

634
00:35:18,256 --> 00:35:19,840
This ain't some skank-ass broad.

635
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,842
Holly's different. She's special.

636
00:35:21,877 --> 00:35:23,961
Tonight she is. Tomorrow
morning she might be.

637
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:25,262
Give me a fucking break.

638
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:27,214
Come on, Tommy, you... you and I both know

639
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,799
you ain't gonna feel that
way in a month or a year.

640
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:30,718
Why you care who I'm boning anyway?

641
00:35:30,802 --> 00:35:33,053
Because you're fucking someone
who works at my business,

642
00:35:33,104 --> 00:35:34,972
which makes this about my business.

643
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:36,357
Last I checked, this
was a 50-50 partnership,

644
00:35:36,391 --> 00:35:39,727
which makes Holly just as much
my employee as she is yours.

645
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:46,951
Look, man, that just means
I can't fuck her either.

646
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:49,954
But you better not have told
her about our other thing.

647
00:35:50,038 --> 00:35:53,991
This ain't my first rodeo. Do
you think I'm fucking stupid?

648
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:14,094
The department splurged on this?

649
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:16,347
I may have submitted it as
a slightly different expense.

650
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:19,567
We get Lobos, no one will care.

651
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:22,937
You manipulated NYPD and Customs?

652
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:25,439
You don't give two shits
about protocol, do you?

653
00:36:25,523 --> 00:36:28,025
Just like you fucking Knox
right under Frankie's nose.

654
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:29,109
Not this again.

655
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:32,993
_

656
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:34,081
Why do you care?

657
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:36,116
'Cause I don't want you to fuck up again.

658
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:38,085
If Knox's dick is the reason
you got distracted last week,

659
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,170
- I want to know.
- Were you sucking Saxe off?

660
00:36:40,255 --> 00:36:41,705
Is that why you missed Anibal's doer?

661
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,791
Your head was under the dashboard,

662
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:46,010
Saxe's eyes were closed.

663
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:48,619
_
_

664
00:37:02,978 --> 00:37:04,278
Where's your fucking key?

665
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:07,481
I heard voices.

666
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:09,149
I wanted to make sure the coast was clear.

667
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:10,317
I got you just the ticket to get you

668
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:13,287
in the high council of the Soldado Nation.

669
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:15,322
You must be offering
yourself or a ton of drugs,

670
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:16,624
'cause pussy and powder are the only things

671
00:37:16,658 --> 00:37:18,959
- that'll get me next to Ruiz.
- Whoa.

672
00:37:18,994 --> 00:37:21,412
Can you watch your mouth?
There's a lady present.

673
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:23,964
Who the fuck is this?

674
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,050
Nomar, this is Joe Gonzales,

675
00:37:26,134 --> 00:37:28,335
a reptile specialist with the department.

676
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,921
Why you always bringing new people?

677
00:37:31,006 --> 00:37:34,341
This is supposed to be
an "A" and "B" situation.

678
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,343
Reptile man needs to see his way out.

679
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:41,899
Okay, but not until I show you...

680
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:44,318
how to handle this.

681
00:37:47,906 --> 00:37:49,406
Whoa.

682
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:10,044
- _
- Holly!

683
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:11,512
I got your coat! Come on!

684
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:13,380
We out of here.

685
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,015
_

686
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:18,886
Bye, Tasha.

687
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,387
Bye, James.

688
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:23,891
Uh, I'll see you at work tomorrow.

689
00:38:23,942 --> 00:38:25,109
See you, T.

690
00:38:25,193 --> 00:38:26,226
Thank you.

691
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:28,228
Yeah.

692
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:33,867
They're like the Cosby Show, you know?

693
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:35,486
She seems to have it all...

694
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,955
other than the fact that her
husband's cheating on her.

695
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:41,075
What did you just say?

696
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,376
I was dropping some receipts off

697
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,078
in the office the other night,

698
00:38:44,162 --> 00:38:46,330
and I walked in on Mr. St. Patrick

699
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:49,583
nailing some latina.

700
00:38:49,634 --> 00:38:52,252
You need to mind your own fucking business.

701
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:54,805
- What did I do?
- Just shut the fuck up!

702
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:55,806
Damn!

703
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,225
Tommy!

704
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:00,928
I'm sorry.

705
00:39:01,012 --> 00:39:03,514
I shouldn't have said that.

706
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:10,604
What are you apologizing for?

707
00:39:10,655 --> 00:39:13,073
That made you angry.

708
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:14,942
And I don't like seeing you that way.

709
00:39:20,115 --> 00:39:23,450
I like it when you feel good.

710
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:35,379
- Where you been?
- You're not gonna believe this.

711
00:39:35,463 --> 00:39:38,215
But Medina finally got on board,
helping me with a Nomar thing.

712
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:41,018
Nomar should be in at
Ruiz's party tomorrow night.

713
00:39:41,102 --> 00:39:42,052
Look, I'm not trying to be a dick,

714
00:39:42,137 --> 00:39:43,971
but technically, Nomar is my C.I.

715
00:39:44,022 --> 00:39:45,305
So, if you want to let Medina in,

716
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:47,107
you should have at
least consulted me first.

717
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:49,977
I know you're upset, but
can we talk some other time?

718
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:51,478
Because I'm running late
to meet some friends.

719
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:54,398
Yeah, sure. Some other time...

720
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:56,266
Like when you're ready
to be honest with me.

721
00:39:56,301 --> 00:39:57,801
You know, whenever that is.

722
00:39:57,886 --> 00:39:59,470
- Greg.
- Are you sleeping with Medina?

723
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:00,637
What?

724
00:40:00,722 --> 00:40:01,722
It's not like it's not your M.O.

725
00:40:01,806 --> 00:40:04,441
To fuck somebody at work.

726
00:40:04,476 --> 00:40:06,860
- Fuck you, Greg.
- Not lately.

727
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:08,862
We're gonna talk about this tomorrow.

728
00:40:08,947 --> 00:40:10,397
No. No, we're gonna talk about this now.

729
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:11,482
I got to go.

730
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,450
I'm not letting you walk out that door.

731
00:40:15,787 --> 00:40:18,071
Can I at least tell my
friends I can't show up?

732
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:28,966
Rolla, what up?

733
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,834
I heard the fat man got marked.

734
00:40:30,885 --> 00:40:32,169
I don't know who you
got on them corners, but

735
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,253
rock street Killahz are ready to step up

736
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:35,472
- and take one for the team?
- No question.

737
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:37,474
I done kept it 100 with you
and white boy from the jump.

738
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:39,977
Good. Tommy filled me in on the meeting.

739
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:42,846
But we still haven't found
out who's hitting us...

740
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:45,098
unless you got something you want to spill.

741
00:40:45,183 --> 00:40:47,351
Negative.

742
00:40:47,435 --> 00:40:50,020
Well, Tainos got Anibal's
number two in place already.

743
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:52,189
I don't see any reason for
him to lose his territory,

744
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,024
unless you doing some serious ear hustling

745
00:40:54,108 --> 00:40:55,192
and want to help me kill

746
00:40:55,276 --> 00:40:56,577
the motherfucker behind this shit.

747
00:40:56,661 --> 00:40:59,196
- On it.
- All right. Later.

748
00:40:59,197 --> 00:41:01,526
_

749
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,588
First of all, I'm not fucking Medina

750
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:10,174
- or anyone at the office.
- Anyone else, you mean.

751
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,459
People get into
relationships at work, Greg.

752
00:41:12,544 --> 00:41:14,294
When you spend 20 hours a
day together in an office,

753
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:15,546
it happens.

754
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,381
- I'm not a whore.
- I never said that.

755
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:19,016
Funny, I heard it loud and clear.

756
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:22,553
Medina asked me today if I was fucking you.

757
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:25,806
- And what did you tell him?
- That nothing was going on.

758
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,224
He was asking because I fucked up

759
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:29,893
the raid the other day.

760
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:31,895
I don't want to fight with you, Greg.

761
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,399
I just want to catch
Lobos and call it a day.

762
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,401
I got to be able to talk
to our other colleagues

763
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:39,486
without you thinking
I'm sleeping with them.

764
00:41:39,571 --> 00:41:41,154
I got to be able to meet our C.I.

765
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,906
without you breathing down my neck.

766
00:41:42,957 --> 00:41:44,825
I got to have some space, Greg.

767
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:46,076
You know what? You can
blame this on our jobs

768
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,997
as much as you want, but
this is a "you" problem.

769
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:54,051
So, whatever it is,
whatever's going on with you,

770
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:56,003
Jesus, good luck.

771
00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:00,924
Here's your space.

772
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:21,528
Morning, Shawn.

773
00:42:21,613 --> 00:42:22,663
Hey.

774
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:27,251
Is that a new suit?

775
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:28,452
Yeah.

776
00:42:28,503 --> 00:42:30,370
Let me see how it looks.

777
00:42:35,343 --> 00:42:38,428
This has my husband written all over it.

778
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,048
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to visit
my dad again in a few days.

779
00:42:41,132 --> 00:42:43,133
G wanted me to look nice.

780
00:42:43,184 --> 00:42:46,219
You and Ghost are getting pretty close.

781
00:42:46,304 --> 00:42:49,056
You probably see a lot
driving him around, huh, Shawn?

782
00:42:54,028 --> 00:42:57,197
This suit fits you perfectly.

783
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:01,485
And I love how it feels.

784
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,326
I think he's keeping something from me,

785
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,546
and I want to know how
long it's been going on.

786
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,132
Uh, I wish I knew what
you were talking about.

787
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:17,250
Hmm, you're a terrible liar.

788
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,006
What's going on between
my husband and Tommy?

789
00:43:25,093 --> 00:43:27,811
Well, um...

790
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:29,896
They've been having a lot
of disagreements lately.

791
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:32,349
Disagreements about what?

792
00:43:33,935 --> 00:43:35,352
You can tell me.

793
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:38,238
It'll be another one of our little secrets.

794
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,410
I don't really know.

795
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:45,529
They've been beefing ever since
we got back from that meeting.

796
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:46,830
Tasha.

797
00:43:46,864 --> 00:43:47,998
Is Shawn out there?

798
00:43:48,032 --> 00:43:49,416
Yeah, he's reading the paper.

799
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,284
Morning, boss. You ready?

800
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:52,452
Morning. Yeah.

801
00:43:52,537 --> 00:43:54,421
- Have a good day.
- You too.

802
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:05,799
Whatever you want.

803
00:44:07,018 --> 00:44:08,885
Hey, let me call you back.

804
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,021
You got my messages?

805
00:44:11,055 --> 00:44:13,056
What messages?

806
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:17,444
Simon Stern came into the club last night.

807
00:44:19,564 --> 00:44:20,814
You better be shitting me.

808
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:23,233
You were M.I.A., so I bonded with Stern,

809
00:44:23,284 --> 00:44:25,285
skinning and grinning my
way around a conversation

810
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,287
about us underbidding
him for those parties.

811
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:29,122
You trying to angle to
get a job with him, huh?

812
00:44:29,207 --> 00:44:30,991
No, I left you a message
on your voice mail,

813
00:44:31,075 --> 00:44:32,242
and I tried you at home.

814
00:44:32,326 --> 00:44:34,544
Your wife said you were in the shower.

815
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,546
I did my job.

816
00:44:36,581 --> 00:44:40,333
I didn't see one missed call
or a fucking voice mail, Kantos.

817
00:44:40,418 --> 00:44:42,169
You were hooking V.I.P.s
up with bottle girls

818
00:44:42,253 --> 00:44:44,921
at the last club you worked.

819
00:44:45,006 --> 00:44:47,257
No one would hire you
with a fistful of 50s.

820
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:50,093
So don't stand there acting
like your ass don't stink,

821
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:52,179
or I'll send you back
to your P.O. to air out.

822
00:44:52,263 --> 00:44:54,231
Next time you get in your fucking car

823
00:44:54,265 --> 00:44:56,266
and you drive to my
fucking house, you hear me?

824
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,406
I heard Raina's audition. She sang well.

825
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,608
Obviously not well enough.

826
00:45:04,692 --> 00:45:05,776
These roles are limited

827
00:45:05,827 --> 00:45:07,778
and typically granted to sixth graders.

828
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:09,946
Except Suzie Spencer got the lead last year

829
00:45:09,997 --> 00:45:12,365
as a fifth grader.

830
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,536
Mrs. St. Patrick, three
generations of Spencers

831
00:45:16,621 --> 00:45:18,288
have matriculated through our school.

832
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:20,173
I'm sure you understand.

833
00:45:20,258 --> 00:45:22,342
The decision's been made in the matter.

834
00:45:25,012 --> 00:45:27,464
Oh, has it?

835
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:26,990
- Vibora.
- Mira quien es.

836
00:46:27,024 --> 00:46:28,408
- How are you?
- Felicitaciones.

837
00:46:31,946 --> 00:46:33,196
What's that?

838
00:46:33,281 --> 00:46:35,532
A tribute for Vibora.

839
00:47:13,988 --> 00:47:18,791
_

840
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:27,551
How did you get this in the country?

841
00:47:27,585 --> 00:47:29,469
Happy high holy day, Vibora.

842
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:32,388
_
_

843
00:47:35,593 --> 00:47:38,562
Venga. Dame la botella.

844
00:47:38,596 --> 00:47:40,564
Thank you.

845
00:47:40,598 --> 00:47:43,516
Toma ahi. Toma, toma.

846
00:47:49,394 --> 00:47:52,629
_

847
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,028
I'll be right back, babe.

848
00:47:55,112 --> 00:47:56,363
Uh, babe, you want to tell
me why you didn't tell me

849
00:47:56,447 --> 00:47:58,865
Kantos called last night?

850
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,200
I must've forgot,

851
00:48:00,284 --> 00:48:02,452
with all the running
around with the dinner.

852
00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:05,455
I missed a very important
meeting with Simon Stern.

853
00:48:05,506 --> 00:48:06,456
I'm sorry.

854
00:48:15,466 --> 00:48:18,051
Hello?

855
00:48:18,135 --> 00:48:20,303
May I ask who's calling?

856
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:24,357
Raina, pick up the phone!

857
00:48:33,284 --> 00:48:35,869
- Mom, dad, I got the part.
- What?

858
00:48:35,953 --> 00:48:38,038
That was the drama director.
They made a mistake.

859
00:48:38,122 --> 00:48:40,040
I've been double-cast
with Suzie to play Annie.

860
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:42,375
What? Congratulations, honey.

861
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,544
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

862
00:48:44,629 --> 00:48:46,246
Look at that.

863
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,214
I told you it would work
out in the end, baby girl.

864
00:48:48,299 --> 00:48:49,549
I got to go call all my friends!

865
00:48:49,634 --> 00:48:51,217
Call 'em.

866
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,505
Um, I'll be right back.

867
00:48:55,556 --> 00:48:57,507
We're out of milk.

868
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,412
_

869
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:16,026
Yo, I ain't got a 420 text
from you in a minute, T.

870
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,278
Got some extra-good shit
to mark the occasion.

871
00:49:18,362 --> 00:49:20,030
You must really need to hit this.

872
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:22,532
Yeah, but don't be rolling
up in front of my building.

873
00:49:22,616 --> 00:49:24,034
Damn.

874
00:49:24,118 --> 00:49:25,869
Ghost hates it when I smoke.

875
00:49:25,953 --> 00:49:28,371
Fuck that. He don't need to know.

876
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:36,212
That girl Holly is way too fast for you.

877
00:49:36,263 --> 00:49:37,547
Seriously?

878
00:49:37,598 --> 00:49:39,549
I mean, you like her, you like her,

879
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,051
but that's just my two cents.

880
00:49:41,102 --> 00:49:43,386
Noted.

881
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:50,226
- Relax. I'm a pro with this.
- Yeah, all right, I can't tell.

882
00:49:50,277 --> 00:49:52,445
Nigga, I got kids.

883
00:49:56,283 --> 00:49:58,485
Look, I know I'm starting to
sound like a broken record,

884
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:00,070
but your boy's head ain't in the game.

885
00:50:00,154 --> 00:50:02,789
You know Ghost is always on some next shit.

886
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,877
Come on, we'll be out
your hood in a minute.

887
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:10,380
Ain't no one gonna see your ass.

888
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,389
I'm just saying, he depends
on us to keep him grounded.

889
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:21,307
But now he's talking to me sideways,

890
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:23,259
- disrespecting you and shit.
- Nah.

891
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,012
Don't lie to me to my face
you left early the other night

892
00:50:26,097 --> 00:50:28,898
because you and Ghost
got into a fight, right?

893
00:50:36,107 --> 00:50:37,774
You think Ghost is drinking again?

894
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:40,610
This ain't no bottle problem, T.

895
00:50:42,446 --> 00:50:44,364
Maybe Ghost is just going through

896
00:50:44,448 --> 00:50:46,866
some sort of midlife crisis.

897
00:50:46,951 --> 00:50:48,168
It's too early for that.

898
00:50:51,956 --> 00:50:54,541
I think it's just this club shit.

899
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:57,093
That's a symptom, not the disease.

900
00:50:57,128 --> 00:50:59,045
Ghost is changing, Tommy.

901
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,298
I'm starting to think it
ain't a temporary thing.

902
00:51:22,453 --> 00:51:24,037
It's starting to get crowded.

903
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:25,955
Stay by me and keep your head on a swivel.

904
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,874
- Salud.
- Salud.

905
00:51:31,128 --> 00:51:32,545
Otra.

906
00:51:56,604 --> 00:51:58,354
I'll be in the champagne room.

907
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:27,387
_

908
00:54:37,014 --> 00:54:38,431
_

909
00:54:43,404 --> 00:54:46,022
_

910
00:55:00,037 --> 00:55:01,371
Shit.

911
00:55:01,455 --> 00:55:03,256
Coño!

912
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,425
Vibora's hurt!

913
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:08,044
Something's wrong!

914
00:55:11,015 --> 00:55:12,348
What the fuck happened?

915
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,541
You remember Tommy and I had a rap group?

916
00:55:38,575 --> 00:55:42,545
JSP and DJ Tommy-Toms?

917
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:44,380
You remember the rap I made up for you?

918
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,385
♪ I like it, she... she love it ♪

919
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,888
♪ no hesitation, I
had to push up on it ♪

920
00:55:51,922 --> 00:55:54,891
♪ uh, uh, I like it,
uh, uh, she love it ♪

921
00:55:54,925 --> 00:55:57,894
♪ no hesitation, I
had to push up on it ♪

922
00:55:57,928 --> 00:56:00,396
It's a good thing
you became a businessman.

923
00:56:00,431 --> 00:56:02,432
Be quiet.

924
00:56:02,516 --> 00:56:07,103
You know you like it.

925
00:56:13,077 --> 00:56:15,361
It's work. I should probably get this.

926
00:56:15,446 --> 00:56:17,280
I'll take it in the other room.

927
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,666
Tommy, what's up?

928
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:21,784
What do you need?

929
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:24,203
Nomar just called. Ruiz has been stabbed.

930
00:56:24,288 --> 00:56:25,538
Are you serious?

931
00:56:25,622 --> 00:56:27,457
Ruiz got stabbed, right in the chest.

932
00:56:27,508 --> 00:56:28,958
Excellent.

933
00:56:29,009 --> 00:56:30,793
Apparently Nomar's in with him,

934
00:56:30,878 --> 00:56:32,462
and they're headed somewhere
to get medical attention.

935
00:56:32,513 --> 00:56:34,213
It wasn't the Jamaicans we hired.

936
00:56:34,298 --> 00:56:36,215
Someone went after him and missed.

937
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,300
He ain't dead.

938
00:56:37,384 --> 00:56:38,551
Where are you?

939
00:56:38,635 --> 00:56:40,269
I'm on my way in right now.

940
00:56:40,304 --> 00:56:42,138
So, if someone else swung at him,

941
00:56:42,189 --> 00:56:44,190
that means he's not the source
of our problem after all.

942
00:56:44,274 --> 00:56:47,944
We got to meet up, sort all this out.

943
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:50,279
Work is blowing up. I got to go.

944
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:11,933

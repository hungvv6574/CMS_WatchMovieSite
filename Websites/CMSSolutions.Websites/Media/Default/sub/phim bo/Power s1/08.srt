1
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,046
<i>Previously on Power...</i>

2
00:00:10,046 --> 00:00:12,117
When we met, who'd you
think I was gonna be?

3
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:14,202
The biggest goddamn drug
dealer in New York City.

4
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:17,039
I don't know any old,
wrinkled drug dealers.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,041
They're either dead or inside.

6
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:22,044
Since when do you lie to me?
Since when do you hide shit?

7
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:24,046
Ghost took back his loyalty,

8
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:26,048
so now it's time for you to do the same.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,100
I want to change my life for you.

10
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:30,218
I don't want to break up your marriage.

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,803
You like having me around, huh?

12
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:33,920
- I do.
- I want your offer.

13
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:36,558
- $6 million to own it outright.
- Truth is not for sale.

14
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:40,025
The moment I detect
disloyalty, I cut it out.

15
00:00:40,026 --> 00:00:41,042
You was right about Rolla.

16
00:00:41,043 --> 00:00:42,453
I'm sorry it turned out like this, G.

17
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:43,315
It was Kanan, right?

18
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:45,086
You were still tight after all these years.

19
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,402
I am your friend.

20
00:00:47,453 --> 00:00:49,179
Rolla's dead. You owe me money.

21
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,521
And you owe me bodies.

22
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:52,505
You make sure my son ain't
dead when you do it neither.

23
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:54,391
I want Ghost dead before I get out.

24
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,067
I'm your friend.

25
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:39,077
I guess we should get to it.

26
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:41,455
I am your friend.

27
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:46,158
They say we supposed to get ten inches.

28
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:10,490
I'm your friend.

29
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,686
Glass was empty.

30
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:59,857
The coroner found whiskey
in Rolla's stomach.

31
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:03,611
So whoever killed him
gave him a last drink.

32
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:07,698
That's classy.

33
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,594
So I hear you turned down
the new Border Task Force

34
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,253
in Detroit.

35
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:16,207
- Guess you'll be sticking around?
- Rolla's murder is a new lead.

36
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:19,961
Sure, but we have no money to follow it.

37
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:22,413
With Lobos being prosecuted in California,

38
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:23,598
they've shut us down.

39
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:27,476
Now Rolla's death is
officially an NYPD case,

40
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:28,894
just like Anibal.

41
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:30,228
Might be the same hitter.

42
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,530
I don't think so.

43
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,281
He had a drink.

44
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,200
At the kill shot, he fell
right out of his chair

45
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,535
on to the floor.

46
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,904
No defensive wounds, no sign of struggle.

47
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:40,446
You think it was someone he knew?

48
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,574
And he didn't see it coming.

49
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:46,378
He trusted the person.

50
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,413
You think it was the distributor?

51
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:52,133
You think it was Ghost.

52
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,586
You could be right.

53
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:56,304
But it doesn't matter.

54
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:02,060
Cali will have Lobos indicted
by the end of the week.

55
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:06,264
It's time to let it go, Cowgirl.

56
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:11,019
We'll get the next one.

57
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,105
I'm gonna get some water.

58
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:16,741
No!

59
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,077
Bed gets cold when you leave.

60
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,613
It always does.

61
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:26,084
I like it when you're like this.

62
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:30,622
You kind of scared me the other night.

63
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:36,127
Ghost did that thing we talked
about, so I'm all good now.

64
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:39,598
Who's Ghost?

65
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,606
James.

66
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,109
Ghost is a...

67
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,445
nickname, like...

68
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,316
just between me and him.

69
00:05:58,318 --> 00:05:59,401
Why "Ghost"?

70
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:05,991
We knew this guy "Breeze"
when we were kids.

71
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:09,210
He came up with Ghost.

72
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:13,331
He said the kid had the
ability to disappear.

73
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:18,470
Never saw him coming,
you never saw him leave.

74
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:23,141
Those expensive-ass shoes he
wears now changed all that,

75
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,511
clickety-fucking-clack.

76
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:30,181
I heard him the other night.

77
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,684
He was here, right?

78
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:34,352
I didn't know you were awake.

79
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:36,104
Holly, you shoulda said something.

80
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:38,607
Tommy, it's okay.

81
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:40,108
You can trust me.

82
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,493
I told you.

83
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:45,113
Ghost has Tasha in his corner.

84
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:47,032
She knows everything, right?

85
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,500
And she's got his back.

86
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,702
Yeah.

87
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:54,255
Maybe I can be like that.

88
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,210
Someone in your corner, just for you.

89
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,552
- Jamie.
- Angie, how you doing?

90
00:07:07,603 --> 00:07:09,721
I'll be better when I see you.

91
00:07:09,772 --> 00:07:11,640
Yeah, I wish you were
here with me right now.

92
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:14,392
You know,

93
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:16,811
<i>I'm free the night of
the Sutton place party.</i>

94
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:20,398
Tasha's known about it for weeks now.

95
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,535
I told her she could come.

96
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,737
Yeah, of course.

97
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:27,789
Look, Angie baby, I promise, all right,

98
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,075
I'm gonna change my life.

99
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:33,578
It's gonna be my club, my kids, and you.

100
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,751
Could I see you today?

101
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:43,421
I've got Raina's play. She's Annie.

102
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,941
Be with your family.

103
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:04,659
Angie.

104
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:08,279
I got to go.

105
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,494
- Hello.
- Thanks again.

106
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,624
- Hi, Mrs. St. Patrick.
- Thank you so much.

107
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,331
- It was great.
- Mom, mom, mom!

108
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:33,972
Congratulations.

109
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:36,835
- Hey, how are you?
- Great, I appreciate it.

110
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:40,672
- Oh, goodness.
- How was it?

111
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,625
- You were amazing, baby girl.
- There she is.

112
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:44,876
I'm so proud of you.

113
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:46,845
My superstar.

114
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,513
Oh, daddy loves you.

115
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,798
You made me cry.

116
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:53,268
Hey, tell your sister how good she did.

117
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,936
- You did great, Raina.
- Thanks, Riq.

118
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,722
I have a special surprise for you, Miss.

119
00:09:57,724 --> 00:09:59,724
You can invite four girls
to come home with us,

120
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:00,892
and they can sleep over.

121
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:02,277
- I can?
- Mm-hmm.

122
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,229
- Whoever I want?
- Yes, baby.

123
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,814
You can stay up, have a good time,

124
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:06,564
watch a movie.

125
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:07,899
Go ask their moms if it's okay.

126
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,818
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

127
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,870
Really, Mom?

128
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,278
Tariq, I already asked Owen's
mom if it's okay too, all right?

129
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,373
You did?

130
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:17,292
You guys can be in your room
while the girls have the den.

131
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,410
- Thanks, Mom!
- Yes, you're welcome.

132
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:23,915
Now you better come home,
and help me with this shit.

133
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:26,417
You don't have to go back
to the club right now.

134
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:29,387
Raina deserves her daddy on her big day.

135
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,556
- Mr. and Mrs. St. Patrick.
- Hi.

136
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,974
Hello, hi.

137
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,592
Raina was excellent today.

138
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:35,977
She certainly worked hard enough.

139
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,395
- Yes, she was.
- Thank you.

140
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,013
No, thank you.

141
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:41,933
Your generous donation will
get that playground finished

142
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:43,601
in just a couple of months.

143
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,320
We're all very excited about it.

144
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,604
You both should be very proud.

145
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:48,990
Thank you.

146
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,910
Generous donation?

147
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:53,912
You see how great she was, right?

148
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,664
Wow, Tasha.

149
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,449
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with me?

150
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,535
I got to get back to work to
make some of that money back.

151
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,754
- That's what's wrong with me.
- Babe.

152
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,956
Raina, tell Daddy good-bye.

153
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,458
See you, baby. Mm, I'm so proud of you.

154
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:13,014
Babe.

155
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:23,858
Needs more Rosemary.

156
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:27,562
And it's flat.

157
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:28,980
- James.
- Cynthia.

158
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,982
Just checking in on a few final details.

159
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,784
Of course you are.

160
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:40,408
Now, that works.

161
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,877
- My clients are gonna love this.
- I know they will.

162
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,579
And I'm hoping this is just the beginning

163
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,831
for our working relationship.

164
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,500
I've told you before,
and I'll say it again.

165
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:51,336
Your business is just the springboard

166
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:53,671
for the kind of nightlife
empire I'm trying to build.

167
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:55,038
And I am sure you'll do it.

168
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,392
You seem like the kind of
guy that gets what he wants.

169
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:02,251
I want your word that I'll
get this party again next year.

170
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:06,150
As tempting as the idea of
spending more time with you is,

171
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,735
James, you know I can't promise that.

172
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,938
Sure you can.

173
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:11,439
We're thinking of having the party

174
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,408
at Art Basel weekend next year.

175
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,743
- In Miami?
- Mm.

176
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,108
Exactly, capitalizing on
the international crowd.

177
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:20,283
Stern's opening a club on Ocean Drive.

178
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:23,618
- Probably do the party there.
- Of course.

179
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:26,366
We've done New York to death.

180
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:30,959
It gets so cold here.

181
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,543
I feel trapped after a while.

182
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:36,130
Miami, it'd be warm, sunny...

183
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:39,851
Fresh start.

184
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:50,645
A fresh start.

185
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:59,537
Cynthia Sheridan signed the
final contracts for the party.

186
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,789
Any of the guests puke
on the banquettes again,

187
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,264
she'll pay for re-upholstery herself.

188
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,043
Have it in print.

189
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,577
That's funny.

190
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:08,046
You okay, boss?

191
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,214
Absolutely.

192
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,083
Doesn't seem like it.

193
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,085
Speaking of Cynthia, did she tell you

194
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:16,721
next year's party's gonna be in Miami?

195
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,089
No shit.

196
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:20,174
One of Simon Stern's clubs.

197
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:22,844
- That motherfucker's everywhere.
- South Beach is hot.

198
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:24,954
I worked as a promoter
there a couple of winters.

199
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:26,644
You still know people down there?

200
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:27,982
Yeah, I do. Why?

201
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,984
Get your food while it's hot.

202
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:31,102
Come on, girls, eat up.

203
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:33,021
There's plenty for everybody.

204
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,822
- Ladies first.
- Tariq, stop it.

205
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,908
Come on.

206
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,776
And make sure you take a napkin, all right?

207
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:41,529
Be careful, don't spill
anything on the couch.

208
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,000
- Let me get two.
- Get that pillow.

209
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:49,253
I never did anything like this for you.

210
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:53,007
I see you trying to do
better by these kids.

211
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,959
I am.

212
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,096
I'm just trying to be a good...

213
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:16,230
Where's James?

214
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:19,951
He's with another woman.

215
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,828
Told you that club was trouble.

216
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,049
Some model or something?

217
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:38,169
I wish it was like that.

218
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,174
Shawn told me her name is Angela.

219
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:44,642
You were right.

220
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,893
You happy now?

221
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,011
I couldn't keep him.

222
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:48,729
Of course I'm not happy.

223
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:52,183
I remember how this felt.

224
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:57,188
Your father would come home, take a shower,

225
00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:01,659
and get in bed next to
me like it was nothing.

226
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:06,531
Then he stopped taking that shower.

227
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:08,666
I talked to Lakeisha about it.

228
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,918
I'm just gonna get a lawyer,

229
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,870
and I'm sure I'll get custody of the kids.

230
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:16,924
Lakeisha is as simple as two plus two.

231
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,961
You are married to a drug dealer, Tasha.

232
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:21,712
Ghost would never hurt me.

233
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:24,715
There are all different
kinds of hurt, baby.

234
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:27,101
What would you do if
you had to leave tonight?

235
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,020
Do you have any money of your own?

236
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,973
The legit accounts are in both our names.

237
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:33,691
I can get half of that.

238
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,226
I done told you before,

239
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:39,564
you ain't got no legal
claim on his illegal money.

240
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:41,899
That's what you need to survive.

241
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:45,236
You've got to have a plan.

242
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:49,073
You got to look before you leap, baby.

243
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,633
I have something for you, Angie.

244
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:02,970
Jamie, no more gifts, no more lingerie,

245
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,388
no more shoes.

246
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,424
Just you.

247
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:08,176
Okay, me.

248
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:11,312
We're going to Miami for the weekend.

249
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,231
- What?
- Yeah.

250
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,816
I'm gonna open a Truth down
there like I said I would.

251
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,731
I thought everything
with Stern went sideways.

252
00:16:17,736 --> 00:16:21,656
It did go sideways so
I'm gonna do it on my own.

253
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,157
Kantos knows some people down there.

254
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:26,027
He's gonna arrange some meetings for me.

255
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:28,112
I'm gonna look at rental
space while I'm there.

256
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:31,032
I want your opinion.

257
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,669
I want you to be with me.

258
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,622
Think, the beach, the sun.

259
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:41,626
- Waking up together.
- A fresh start.

260
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:45,012
What will you tell Tasha
about where you're going?

261
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,181
A business trip.

262
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:50,801
But I don't want you to think
about all that, all right?

263
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:53,104
Just come with me.

264
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,772
Just come with me to Miami.

265
00:16:54,806 --> 00:17:00,394
I would love to.

266
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:02,897
- Bye.
- Bye.

267
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:14,968
I'll just meet you after class.

268
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,328
- Hi.
- Hi.

269
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,379
We have to be careful.

270
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:29,924
That's so cute.

271
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:32,260
- You like it?
- Yeah.

272
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:33,978
I saw it today and thought of you.

273
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,179
Here.

274
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,941
I love this.

275
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:51,329
Yeah?

276
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,863
Need a car to meet us at the airport.

277
00:17:52,914 --> 00:17:54,380
We're staying at the Fontainebleau.

278
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,284
Uh, sure, it's St. Patrick.

279
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:59,003
Yo, man, what's up?

280
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,212
Tommy?

281
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:11,849
Yeah?

282
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:18,265
Gentlemen, I apologize for the theatrics,

283
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,911
but your government has
been observing my every move.

284
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:22,893
So I am gonna take every
precaution necessary

285
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:26,197
to conceal my location.

286
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,783
Besides...

287
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,067
Now we all just get to relax.

288
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,318
I think we'd relax a lot better

289
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,404
if we weren't tied up, Jefe.

290
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,122
Very well.

291
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,542
_

292
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:41,412
It seems like your plan
to solve your problem

293
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:43,331
required the killing of
everybody in your organization.

294
00:18:43,382 --> 00:18:46,334
Took some time to find the man responsible.

295
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:49,253
- He handled that personally.
- He was a friend of mine, Jefe.

296
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:50,888
I owed him that much.

297
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,139
Bravo, Ghost, huh?

298
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:55,926
That is old school, man.

299
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:58,241
_

300
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,977
_

301
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,240
- Do you have a plan to rebuild?
- Sure as shit.

302
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,325
We're already in touch with
the new leader of the RSK's,

303
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,244
the Tainos are back in the fold.

304
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,162
Everybody's getting in line.

305
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,998
<i>- Is that true, Ghost?
- Si.</i>

306
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,533
That's good, 'cause from now on,

307
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:22,586
I need you to distribute
double the amount of product.

308
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,955
I was betrayed.

309
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:27,041
Mm-hmm.

310
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:30,795
My operation in California has
been irretrievably compromised.

311
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:34,799
And until that situation is resolved,

312
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,136
I have product in the pipeline
that needs distribution.

313
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:41,105
- We got that.
- We're not set up, Jefe.

314
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,023
Oh, no, we got more than enough contacts

315
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,809
to double our output.

316
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,477
But we have to work out the
logistics, which takes time.

317
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:50,147
We got... we're ready.

318
00:19:57,956 --> 00:20:00,408
- _
- Hmm?

319
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:02,126
Why are you so unsure?

320
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,578
I just don't want to
give you my word, Jefe,

321
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:07,882
unless I can guarantee your distribution.

322
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,500
_

323
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:10,615
_

324
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
_

325
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,230
_

326
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:19,994
_

327
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:25,134
_

328
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:29,391
_

329
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,692
_

330
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,048
_

331
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,538
Saying no would be... _.

332
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:51,041
Oh, we're not saying no.

333
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,594
We're just saying that we need
some time to set up a plan.

334
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,262
To move your weight.

335
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:58,382
Allow you the opportunity
to approve personnel.

336
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:00,551
Fine.

337
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:03,020
I will wait to hear your plan.

338
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:08,559
Are we sure that the
threat to your... hmm...

339
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:11,479
To our business is over?

340
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,565
<i>Fantasma, did you get the right guy?</i>

341
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:16,951
_

342
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,653
Yes.

343
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,818
Yes.

344
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,612
_

345
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:30,247
I have to say, I'm so relieved

346
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:34,301
that we were able to work this out.

347
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,971
I would have hated to
have to kill you today.

348
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,092
It's okay.

349
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:45,179
Hmm?

350
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,058
_

351
00:21:49,668 --> 00:21:53,153
<i>Fantasma, I'll be expecting your call, hmm?</i>

352
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,822
_

353
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:57,658
Hmm?

354
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,341
That was bananas, man!

355
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,961
Who would have thought when
we woke up this morning,

356
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:18,762
that crazy mother fucker'd do us like this?

357
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,298
I'll take it though,
for real. I'll take it.

358
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:23,300
Twice our product, this is huge.

359
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:25,185
What the fuck was that back there?

360
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,637
"I don't know, Jefe. Give us time."

361
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:27,639
He could have killed us.

362
00:22:29,462 --> 00:22:31,542
If we fuck it up, we're
only delaying the inevitable.

363
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:33,193
Don't matter what Lobos says.

364
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,000
Twice the product means
twice the personnel,

365
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:36,313
twice the exposure.

366
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:37,531
This is the moment we waited for.

367
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,033
Twice the fucking risk, Tommy.

368
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,284
We always wanted to expand.

369
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,286
Now, we ain't got to beg for it.

370
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,655
Lobos needs us to move this shit.

371
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:48,409
You always said
"opportunity is luck plus..."

372
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,160
"Preparation," Tommy,
but we never moved weight

373
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:50,954
this big before.

374
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:52,028
We got to be prepared, man.

375
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:53,589
We got to think first, all right?

376
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,416
Can't think too long. Lobos won't wait.

377
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:59,386
Hold on, man.

378
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,729
Glad to see you finally got
your priorities in order.

379
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,181
This is gonna be a good thing, Ghost.

380
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:14,401
I'm gonna go see Ruiz, get it shored up.

381
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:18,072
I'll drop you off on the way.

382
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,273
- Yo, come on.
- Yeah.

383
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:38,258
- Double the product?
- It's double everything.

384
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:42,179
More territory, more enemies,
how are you gonna survive that?

385
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:45,716
<i>How are we gonna survive that, you mean.</i>

386
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:47,468
Because if I'm moving more,

387
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm gonna be leaning on you to do the same.

388
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,805
Line both our mother fucking pockets.

389
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,529
And I appreciate that, but let's be honest,

390
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,392
you've been under attack for months.

391
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,361
We handled that shit. It's over.

392
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,396
But you need to protect
yourselves in order to rebuild.

393
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:00,898
Unless you're willing to do that,

394
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:03,817
than perhaps the Soledado
Nation will be better off

395
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:06,904
finding itself another connect.

396
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:08,739
That's fucked up, Ruiz.

397
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:11,792
Nobody's getting you better
shit than us for the price.

398
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:15,379
Tommy, I got stitches
holding my lungs together,

399
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:18,749
because Rolla's bitch missed
my heart by a dog's hair.

400
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
If I'm gonna get into
something like this with you,

401
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:22,252
I need to feel secure.

402
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,268
You still get your guns out of Florida?

403
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,772
I can get more guns, but
they need to be paid for.

404
00:24:41,823 --> 00:24:44,241
We'll pay for it.

405
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:48,412
From now on, you import guns
for the entire organization.

406
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:51,782
<i>You'll make more money than
every other primera under us,</i>

407
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:53,951
and your security is guaranteed.

408
00:24:53,953 --> 00:24:55,953
Sounds good, but Ghost
will never agree to that.

409
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:04,712
My word's not good enough?

410
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:22,479
- _
- The train, man.

411
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,198
What the fuck you staring at, man?

412
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:26,867
Nothing, man. Nothing.

413
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,904
Relax.

414
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,218
Hello?

415
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,969
<i>Bruja, I need to see you.</i>

416
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:50,257
Nomar, now's not a good
time for bullshit, okay?

417
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:51,925
<i>I saw the distributor, Mami.</i>

418
00:25:51,976 --> 00:25:56,346
- _
- _

419
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,348
Nah, and he wasn't in
that book you showed me.

420
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:00,851
Okay, I need to get you with
the sketch artist right away.

421
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:04,271
<i>No, we got to talk first, Bruja, all right?</i>

422
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:05,572
Witness Protection.

423
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:08,358
If I I.D. this guy, I'm a dead man.

424
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,661
I ain't telling you shit
unless I know I'll be safe.

425
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,329
Nomar called.

426
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:13,781
He saw the distributor last night.

427
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:15,532
Frankie, we could close this case.

428
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,918
They're shipping our files off to L.A.

429
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:18,952
With their thanks.

430
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,871
- Frankie.
- WITSEC?

431
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:24,007
No, I can't get you witness
protection for Nomar Arcielo.

432
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,293
Angela, it is over.

433
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:31,715
Move on.

434
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,687
Where's the guy who's usually outside?

435
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:37,971
What guy?

436
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:39,356
The guy in the telephone truck.

437
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,558
- You made him?
- Yeah, weeks ago.

438
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:44,778
But he's not there now.

439
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:46,780
Look, so we're having a funding issue.

440
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,366
Government's broke, but
no one knows you're here.

441
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,734
You're safe.

442
00:26:50,785 --> 00:26:52,903
Fuck that.

443
00:26:52,954 --> 00:26:54,135
I'm out.

444
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:55,989
<i>Good luck finding your fucking blanquito.</i>

445
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,576
- I'm leaving town.
- Nomar, I got you WITSEC.

446
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:00,961
Witness Protection?

447
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:04,581
My boss approved it this morning.

448
00:27:07,468 --> 00:27:09,753
- Really?
- Yeah.

449
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,005
But you got to stay here
until I can get the Marshals

450
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:13,757
to take you into custody.

451
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,761
Nah, I got to say good-bye to some people.

452
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:22,065
I'll arrange a farewell with
the Marshals for your family.

453
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,653
Until then, don't talk to anyone, okay?

454
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:30,440
Give me 24 hours.

455
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:36,613
_

456
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:51,712
So Ruiz in?

457
00:27:51,763 --> 00:27:54,097
- He wouldn't commit.
- Motherfucker.

458
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,647
He wants to bring in guns for us.

459
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:57,801
We put up the money this
time, he straps our whole crew,

460
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:01,855
but the real problem is expansion.

461
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,524
I say we go to the Serb and
Drift, some of their friends.

462
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,810
We get North Jersey and
Staten Island on lock.

463
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:08,716
No, they got their own
connect bringing the product.

464
00:28:08,717 --> 00:28:10,522
To lure them away, we got
to lower our fucking price.

465
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,365
No wa...

466
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:12,504
Or we kill that mother fucker,

467
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:13,650
and make ourselves the best option.

468
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:14,756
So let me get this straight.

469
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:16,870
You're saying that we run
the gun deal with Ruiz,

470
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,989
we hit a major connect,
possibly starting a war.

471
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:24,044
- That's the plan?
- You got a better idea?

472
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:26,713
You got to start trusting me, Ghost.

473
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:31,051
I was right about Rolla, wasn't I?

474
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,387
I'm your friend.

475
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,505
The moment I detect disloyalty,

476
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,675
I cut it out like a cancer.

477
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:40,597
_

478
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,009
_

479
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:43,804
_

480
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,610
You're right, Tommy.

481
00:28:56,661 --> 00:28:59,162
You're right.

482
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:02,032
I got distracted.

483
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,918
And then you stepped it up.

484
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:07,587
If you hadn't been about it all this time,

485
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,039
we wouldn't be in this position to rebuild.

486
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:13,460
I shoulda listened to you.

487
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:17,881
Damn straight, you shoulda listened to me.

488
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:21,885
So now I'm listening.

489
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:24,104
You want to do the gun deal with Ruiz?

490
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,939
We get street soldiers, then we expand.

491
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,641
We get the RSK's, the Tainos,

492
00:29:27,692 --> 00:29:29,977
I get Ruiz back in line,
the Haitians, the Serbs,

493
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:31,194
maybe even the Chinese.

494
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:32,779
How fast can we make this happen?

495
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,449
You say the word, I'll make the calls.

496
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,067
You don't need me to say the word.

497
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:38,652
I think you should take the lead on this,

498
00:29:38,703 --> 00:29:40,203
be the authority on the streets.

499
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:42,072
What you mean? We always
done this together.

500
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:43,874
I ain't going anywhere.

501
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:47,461
But if we're making
twice the amount of money,

502
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,546
hell, maybe I should open a second club

503
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,748
to clean that money, hmm?

504
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,750
Maybe you should.

505
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:55,919
I want you to get the respect
you deserve on the streets,

506
00:29:55,921 --> 00:30:00,140
Tommy, so people don't ask me what I think.

507
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:02,592
They ask me what you think.

508
00:30:02,643 --> 00:30:07,931
We're two men, and we speak with one voice.

509
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:12,235
Two men, one voice.

510
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,572
I like that.

511
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:19,159
So after we get all the
commitments, you make the calls.

512
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:21,194
Tell 'em we're good to go.

513
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:24,498
Get that extra cash in our
pocket as fast as we can.

514
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,250
Tommy, one more thing.

515
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:30,670
We can't expand beyond this, all right?

516
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,789
Probably the most weight we can handle.

517
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:35,842
We'll see.

518
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:44,267
Oh.

519
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:51,725
- Hello?
- Shawn.

520
00:30:51,776 --> 00:30:54,194
Dad?

521
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,812
I need you to do something for me.

522
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:59,199
Yeah, anything.

523
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:02,619
You can't tell your uncle
Ghost, Tommy, nobody.

524
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:06,156
I need to know I can trust you.

525
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,164
I need to get Nomar into WITSEC.

526
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:16,883
He saw the distributor the other night.

527
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:20,720
He saw Ghost, but he won't
sit down with a sketch artist

528
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,255
until I give him to the Marshals.

529
00:31:22,306 --> 00:31:25,592
Well, it usually doesn't take that long.

530
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:27,727
Frankie said no.

531
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:29,846
The task force is done.

532
00:31:29,897 --> 00:31:31,598
I've got him holed up at the safe house,

533
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:34,901
but I got to get results,
or he's gonna run.

534
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:36,853
I know you have friends over there.

535
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:38,855
Mm.

536
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,774
You can make a call,

537
00:31:40,825 --> 00:31:44,244
maybe shoehorn him in
into another investigation.

538
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,865
Gang violence, gun possession, kiddie porn.

539
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:53,670
Anything that would support
Nomar's WITSEC application.

540
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,173
I have bent the rules for you more times

541
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,924
than I can possibly count.

542
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:02,012
Frankly, my incentive to
do so has disappeared, so...

543
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:07,050
He saw Ghost's face.

544
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:10,687
Greg.

545
00:32:13,774 --> 00:32:16,026
I'll call over there, see
if they have anything current

546
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,944
where Nomar's information might apply.

547
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:21,198
If I get them to do it,
if I get them to do it,

548
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:22,566
drinks are on you.

549
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:26,820
Deal.

550
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:32,075
Got something to cheer you up.

551
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:35,912
She gave them back to you, huh?

552
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,998
I got those for her.

553
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:42,969
Bought these for you.

554
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,338
You must really love that girl.

555
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:48,925
- These ain't cheap.
- I want us all to be a family.

556
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:52,312
You and Holly getting
along, Ghost back to normal.

557
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,064
Oh, he's back to normal.

558
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:58,652
Yeah, totally back on track.

559
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,770
He knows what matters now.

560
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,990
You think that's what happened?

561
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,943
Think he...

562
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:11,114
Forgot what matters?

563
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:15,001
I think maybe for a minute.

564
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:17,120
But he's back in his senses now.

565
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:22,425
Everything's gonna be okay.

566
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,096
It's gonna be like it always was, T.

567
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,848
The three of us against the world.

568
00:33:32,353 --> 00:33:35,889
Plus Holly now.

569
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,976
Sure.

570
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:50,036
Sure.

571
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:03,034
_

572
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:04,737
_

573
00:34:07,483 --> 00:34:08,493
_

574
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,727
_

575
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:23,019
_

576
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:48,845
<i>Papi! Give it back!</i>

577
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,180
Do your homework, then you get it back.

578
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:51,298
I did it already.

579
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:53,049
Show me.

580
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:18,254
_

581
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,542
_

582
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:34,391
Greg, call me as soon as you hear anything.

583
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,559
I want Nomar in custody.

584
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:38,895
I'm supposed to get on a plane tomorrow,

585
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,314
and if we can't get it done,
I should cancel my trip.

586
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:44,484
Let me know.

587
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:45,935
<i>Hey, Mamita.</i>

588
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,271
Oh, hey, Paz.

589
00:35:48,322 --> 00:35:50,573
- I forgot to tell you.
- You going somewhere?

590
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:52,942
Miami.

591
00:35:52,993 --> 00:35:54,953
They're gonna be doing
some reassignments at work.

592
00:35:54,995 --> 00:35:56,496
I'm looking at the Southern Florida office.

593
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,115
What? That's ridiculous.

594
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,283
There's got to be something closer.

595
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:01,618
You have a lady boss, right?

596
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,503
<i>Did you tell her about Papi?</i>

597
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:06,172
I did, but...

598
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,875
A work trip, huh?

599
00:36:08,926 --> 00:36:10,927
Okay.

600
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:12,629
I'm going with Jamie.

601
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:16,132
He wants to open up a club in South Beach.

602
00:36:16,183 --> 00:36:18,385
If he does, maybe I'll
see if there's a position

603
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:22,305
at my level open in the Miami office.

604
00:36:22,356 --> 00:36:23,890
I don't know.

605
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:25,141
We're going for the weekend,

606
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,360
but we want to make it more permanent,

607
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,612
so maybe Miami's how we do that.

608
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:32,615
Maybe that's what he's telling you,

609
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,235
because he wants to keep fucking you.

610
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:37,871
Jamie loves me.

611
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,372
He told me he's gonna make things work.

612
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:42,158
I believe him.

613
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,654
_

614
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:47,163
This is changing you, Angela.

615
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:48,665
You just lied to my face.

616
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:52,085
I lied, because I knew
you wouldn't support me,

617
00:36:52,136 --> 00:36:54,053
because deep down, I
think you want me to be

618
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:56,473
as alone and unhappy as you are.

619
00:36:56,507 --> 00:37:00,093
I might be unhappy and alone,
but at least I'm not a chilla. _

620
00:37:00,144 --> 00:37:05,265
Can't you see he's making
A liar, a cheat?

621
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:07,517
I told you, Jamie and I are in love.

622
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,519
I need you to be happy for me.

623
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:12,188
I'm not gonna stand by and
watch you ruin your life.

624
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,240
Then I need you to give
me the key to my place.

625
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:18,495
Jamie needs one now, you don't.

626
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,418
So now we're running drugs and guns?

627
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:27,203
Shit, as long as I've known Ghost,

628
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,172
he hasn't been cool with moving heat.

629
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:31,007
He agreed to that?

630
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,675
He did, but from now on,
I ain't got to ask Ghost.

631
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,712
He trusts me to make moves.

632
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,547
I run the streets, he cleans the money.

633
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:38,715
It's all good.

634
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:43,553
Oh, should I come back?

635
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:46,556
No, Julio was just leaving.

636
00:37:46,607 --> 00:37:49,609
Holly, Julio. Julio, Holly.

637
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,227
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

638
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:55,949
It's all there.

639
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:59,569
Lobos is gonna deliver
the powder, same as always,

640
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,571
but we got to figure out how to
get the guns up from Elizabeth.

641
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:04,157
I'll get Victor and Darien
ready to make the runs.

642
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,743
Yeah.

643
00:38:08,212 --> 00:38:11,381
Does he work for you?

644
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,083
Yeah.

645
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:16,553
Ooh, God, you smell good.

646
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:20,256
That's nice.

647
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:40,994
Fuck.

648
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,612
You owe me.

649
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,781
Big.

650
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:47,153
Your friends got Nomar into the program?

651
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:49,786
They are on their way to get
Nomar now for an interview,

652
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,287
and a sketch artist too.

653
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:53,339
Thank you, Greg!

654
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,625
Thank you so much.

655
00:38:55,676 --> 00:39:01,297
This could be the break we're looking for.

656
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:04,350
So you want to get that drink to celebrate?

657
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,553
I can't.

658
00:39:06,604 --> 00:39:09,355
I'm waiting for a call from a friend

659
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,473
in the Southern Florida office.

660
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,225
What, new case?

661
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:16,362
A prosecutor at my level
is leaving for corporate.

662
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:19,065
You know how you said to let Lobos go.

663
00:39:19,116 --> 00:39:20,783
Although now that Nomar's
gonna be in custody,

664
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,402
maybe something can come of it.

665
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:25,154
Wait, what?

666
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:28,207
You're going to Miami?

667
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:32,128
Your father's here. You said you...

668
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:39,502
There is a guy.

669
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:41,671
Was all along.

670
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,473
Is that...

671
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,147
Is that where you're going with this trip,

672
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,259
you're going with him?

673
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,644
It's not like that, Greg.

674
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:50,763
You know, you could have just said it.

675
00:39:50,814 --> 00:39:55,401
- Didn't have to lie to my face.
- It wasn't a lie at the time.

676
00:39:55,436 --> 00:40:00,189
- I wasn't sure about him before.
- Are you sure now?

677
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,256
I got it.

678
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,708
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.

679
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,543
I got it, I got it, I got it.

680
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:23,129
You look really hot in this thing.

681
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,247
That's the idea.

682
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:27,800
More ass equals more tips.

683
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:31,304
You got guys all over
you there, every night.

684
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:32,555
It's a good job.

685
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:36,359
I make good money.

686
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:37,694
You're with me now.

687
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:40,563
You don't need money.

688
00:40:40,614 --> 00:40:43,366
Tell Kantos you quit.

689
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,151
I've never had anybody take care of me.

690
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,738
I wouldn't be good at it.

691
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:52,742
But I could work for you maybe.

692
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:56,913
We'd be in it together.

693
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:04,587
Ruiz, glad you called.

694
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:06,756
- That gun thing is a go.
- Fuck the guns.

695
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:07,840
We could be blood brothers for life

696
00:41:07,891 --> 00:41:09,509
if you do this for me tonight.

697
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:15,481
I do a favor for you, and you're in?

698
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:18,234
Good, what you need, man?

699
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,320
Name is Nomar.

700
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:25,274
Been fucking my little girl.

701
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:27,160
Sent her a picture of his goddamn dick.

702
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:30,279
That's fucked up.

703
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,915
I'll call Julio and send him over.

704
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:37,503
No, don't send no Latino after Nomar.

705
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,956
If he suspects that I
know about him and Isabel,

706
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,199
he'll be looking for PRs...
Somebody that I would send...

707
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:47,130
But he won't be looking for a white guy.

708
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:50,633
- Tomas.
- Got you.

709
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:55,471
Where can I find him?

710
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:12,405
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah, business trip.

711
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:14,407
Kantos has some contacts in Miami.

712
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:16,459
So I'm going tonight
to look at rental space

713
00:42:16,461 --> 00:42:18,211
for a second club.

714
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:22,799
- Second club, in Miami?
- Yeah.

715
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,434
Kantos gonna move down there and run it?

716
00:42:24,468 --> 00:42:25,802
I'll get things started there.

717
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:27,503
He'll run things here.

718
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:30,673
Oh, 'cause he got three kids to look after.

719
00:42:30,724 --> 00:42:33,509
Tasha, if this happens, I'll see the kids.

720
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,013
I'll fly back and forth if I have too.

721
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:38,681
How long you been planning to go?

722
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:40,433
Well, it just came up today.

723
00:42:40,484 --> 00:42:41,651
I could go with you.

724
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:43,986
Big Mama can watch the kids.

725
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:46,272
It's club business, Tasha.

726
00:42:46,323 --> 00:42:48,741
You don't want to hear about it, remember?

727
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:50,910
Ever since you've opened that club,

728
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,662
you've been different, Ghost.

729
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:57,917
It's like I don't know who you are.

730
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:01,370
I've been trying to tell you, Tasha.

731
00:43:01,421 --> 00:43:04,423
You ain't been listening.

732
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:09,045
When I get back from Miami, we should talk.

733
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:45,965
What'd she say?

734
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:50,920
She didn't say much. I think she knew.

735
00:43:50,971 --> 00:43:52,972
We've been growing apart
for a long time, Angie.

736
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,607
You're not the only reason this happened.

737
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:58,594
That doesn't make me feel better.

738
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:22,451
Does this?

739
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:26,589
Hmm?

740
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:31,427
I'm all yours now.

741
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:41,804
And soon I'll be totally free.

742
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:51,647
Told you I'd come through.

743
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:55,368
You did, and you did.

744
00:45:18,008 --> 00:45:20,927
- I need to open a new account.
- Great.

745
00:45:20,978 --> 00:45:22,728
Will we be pulling from
your and Mr. St. Patrick's

746
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:25,181
joint money market or joint checking?

747
00:45:25,232 --> 00:45:29,685
We won't be pulling from anywhere.

748
00:45:29,736 --> 00:45:31,487
I see.

749
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:34,824
I need a checking
account with a debit card.

750
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:39,495
One debit card, my name only.

751
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:43,082
- May I borrow your pen please?
- Of course.

752
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,834
Thank you.

753
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:47,536
I need all the bank
statements sent to this address

754
00:45:47,587 --> 00:45:52,008
in Long Island City,
care of Lakeisha Grant.

755
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:55,544
Is there anything else, Mrs. St. Patrick?

756
00:45:58,598 --> 00:46:01,767
Yes, just one thing.

757
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:03,269
My husband, Mr. St. Patrick,

758
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:05,021
can't know about this account, okay?

759
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,139
Promise me not to say anything?

760
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:09,558
I actually can't.

761
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,480
By law, I'm not allowed to,
so your secret is safe with me.

762
00:46:14,531 --> 00:46:17,066
Alex, you're so sweet.

763
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:18,784
Can you let me into the
safety deposit box now?

764
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:23,789
Yes.

765
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,875
Hey.

766
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:29,578
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

767
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:45,189
_

768
00:47:04,331 --> 00:47:06,949
<i>Bruja, Ruiz knows I'm working for you.</i>

769
00:47:06,951 --> 00:47:09,535
He's gonna try to kill me. Send help.

770
00:47:09,586 --> 00:47:12,588
_

771
00:47:18,178 --> 00:47:22,098
Thank you.

772
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:46,155
I love you.

773
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:52,161
Fuck.

774
00:47:52,163 --> 00:47:57,917
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

775
00:48:10,147 --> 00:48:13,065
See you soon.

776
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,350
Real soon.

777
00:48:25,662 --> 00:48:28,080
<i>Bruja, Ruiz knows I'm working for you.</i>

778
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:29,832
He's gonna try to kill me.

779
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:30,866
Send help.

780
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:35,087
Greg, Nomar's been compromised.

781
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:37,673
We have to get to Queens now.

782
00:49:46,826 --> 00:49:47,993
Hey!

783
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,389
You like to fuck little girls, huh?

784
00:49:49,412 --> 00:49:50,946
Fuck.

785
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:07,680
Ruiz said to bring him your dick.

786
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:10,266
Ghost.

787
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,935
What did you say?

788
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:14,687
Nomar?

789
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:18,224
Nomar?

790
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:30,486
Nomar?

791
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:33,739
Shit!

792
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,824
This is A.U.S.A. Angela valdez.

793
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:37,293
My C.I.'s been stabbed.

794
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:38,827
I need an ambulance and backup now.

795
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:42,831
The suspect might still be in the area.

796
00:50:42,882 --> 00:50:44,875
_

797
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,416
_

798
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:50,055
- Who did this?
- Ghost.

799
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,975
- Where did he go?
- Shit.

800
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:54,176
_

801
00:50:54,227 --> 00:50:55,894
No, no, no, Nomar.

802
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:58,314
Stay with me.

803
00:50:58,348 --> 00:50:59,848
Don't close your eyes. Nuh-uh.

804
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:05,020
_

805
00:52:01,578 --> 00:52:04,380
James, James.

806
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:05,422
This is great.

807
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:07,082
Everyone's having a wonderful time.

808
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:08,967
That's what I like to hear.

809
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:12,388
You know, if it weren't for
the whole Miami Art Basel thing,

810
00:52:12,422 --> 00:52:14,340
I'm sure I could get my
clients to bring this party back

811
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:15,891
to Truth next year.

812
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:17,593
Well, you might not have to choose to.

813
00:52:17,595 --> 00:52:19,928
After you and I had our conversation,

814
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,480
I did some research.

815
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:23,265
And what would you say, Cynthia,

816
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:28,153
if I said I was opening a Truth in Miami?

817
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:29,938
Okay, if you can get it open in time...

818
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:33,609
God, I shouldn't be
saying this... it's a date.

819
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,860
All right.

820
00:52:45,255 --> 00:52:46,872
Have fun.

821
00:52:50,944 --> 00:52:53,055
Holly, I need you to stay downstairs,

822
00:52:53,056 --> 00:52:53,951
and serve the main bar.

823
00:52:53,952 --> 00:52:54,880
I'd rather work upstairs.

824
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:56,265
All the good people are in V.I.P.

825
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:57,966
You do what I say when I say it, okay?

826
00:52:58,017 --> 00:52:59,468
I don't care if you're sleeping with Tommy.

827
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:01,437
You still work for me
until you fucking don't.

828
00:53:01,471 --> 00:53:04,273
Well, actually, tonight's my last night.

829
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:06,392
Tommy doesn't want me working here anymore.

830
00:53:06,443 --> 00:53:09,478
I'm gonna work with him
in your other business.

831
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:11,280
You're gonna do what?

832
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:12,448
That's right.

833
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:17,486
You and I are partners now, Ghost.

834
00:53:17,488 --> 00:53:19,655
What'd you call me?

835
00:53:32,252 --> 00:53:35,337
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

836
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,749
You ain't tell nobody

837
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:55,217
I was getting out tonight now, did you?

838
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:58,420
- No.
- Good.

839
00:54:58,422 --> 00:55:02,057
'Cause I want it to be a surprise.

840
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:06,228
Your loyalty's to me first now, right?

841
00:55:06,262 --> 00:55:09,097
Right.

842
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:13,068
All right.

843
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:15,771
Let's go.

844
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,689
Angela Valdez.

845
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,307
Hey, this is Jim McClure,

846
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:53,559
the sketch artist you requested

847
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:54,810
to work with Nomar Arcielo.

848
00:55:54,861 --> 00:55:56,812
Yeah, hi.

849
00:55:56,863 --> 00:55:59,281
Listen, about that...

850
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:00,616
They didn't pay my hours,

851
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,402
something about the case being closed.

852
00:56:03,453 --> 00:56:04,703
I don't understand.

853
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:06,488
You never met with Nomar. What hours?

854
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:08,874
No, I got Mr. Arcielo's
number from Agent Greg Knox.

855
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:10,492
We spoke on the phone.

856
00:56:10,494 --> 00:56:14,129
But I need to see him in
person to get more details.

857
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:18,166
I was only able to work
up a partial sketch.

858
00:56:18,168 --> 00:56:19,668
Send it to me.

859
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:22,054
You have my email?

860
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:27,259
I'll pay for it out of my own
pocket, just send it to me now.

861
00:57:00,878 --> 00:57:03,295
Jimmy, good to see you again.

862
00:57:03,346 --> 00:57:04,763
Officer Penado.

863
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:06,598
I hate to tell you.

864
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:09,434
We're gonna have to close
Truth down until further notice.

865
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:11,353
- How long?
- Could be a month.

866
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:12,554
Could be a year.

867
00:57:12,605 --> 00:57:16,692
These things take time and money.

868
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:21,196
We'll be in touch.

869
00:57:29,573 --> 00:57:31,239
<i>Fantasma.</i>

870
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:32,708
I was about to give up on you.

871
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:35,410
Lobos, we're in,

872
00:57:35,412 --> 00:57:37,892
but not for double the weight.
I need all the product you can send.

873
00:57:37,893 --> 00:57:39,548
All of it.

874
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:42,300
I'm glad to see you
overcame your hesitation.

875
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:44,753
I have a sudden need for
a larger influx of cash.

876
00:57:44,804 --> 00:57:47,589
We have a deal.

877
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,593
If you come through, the
rewards will be massive.

878
00:57:51,595 --> 00:57:54,429
- If not, well...
- I know the stakes, Jefe.

879
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:57,315
It's quite a large commitment.

880
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:01,603
I know.

881
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:07,609
I'll be the biggest goddamn
drug dealer in New York City.

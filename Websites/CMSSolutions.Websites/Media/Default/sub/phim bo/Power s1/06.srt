<i>Previously on Power...</i>

2
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:12,779
Vibora Ruiz has a thing
for poisonous snakes.

3
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,920
I got you just the ticket to get you

4
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:16,797
in the high council of the Soldado Nation.

5
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:19,370
Happy high holy day, Vibora.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,561
What's going on between
my husband and Tommy?

7
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:23,919
You can tell me.

8
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:26,031
It'll be another one of our little secrets.

9
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:27,612
I want to know what we're doing here.

10
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:28,810
Are we just fucking?

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,779
I am making a choice with you.

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,233
This ain't some skank-ass broad.

13
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,096
Holly's different. She's special.

14
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:35,820
You better not have told her
about our other thing.

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,295
I told you it was Ruiz all along.

16
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:38,591
Yeah, except when you said it was Anibal.

17
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:39,564
Except then. I don't care.

18
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:41,039
Now I just want to kill a motherfucker.

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,217
Ruiz got stabbed.

20
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:43,941
It wasn't the Jamaicans we hired.

21
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:45,386
Someone went after him and missed.

22
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:46,364
He ain't dead.

23
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:48,041
Back then, Kanan kept us in line,

24
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,642
taught us the business, made us men.

25
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:51,756
Ghost and I owe your father big.

26
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:54,859
That's why you're here.

Check.

29
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:40,016
You ain't gonna get me this time, K.

30
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:42,785
I've been practicing.

31
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,994
Yes, you have.

32
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:53,829
Checkmate, motherfucker.

33
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:56,266
What the fuck you talking about?

34
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:01,203
You see it.

35
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:06,809
Don't make me smile you up
right here, motherfucker.

36
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:08,911
Your mama won't appreciate
no closed casket.

37
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,346
Kanan, you got a visitor.

38
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:14,150
Yeah?

39
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:16,918
You need to stop
with that Ruy Lopez bullshit.

40
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:18,353
Rack 'em back up.

41
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:21,089
I'll be back.

42
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:22,791
I been saying the same shit all along.

43
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:25,093
We're calling it prosecutorial misconduct.

44
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,161
I don't give a fuck what you call it,

45
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:27,996
as long as it means I get out.

46
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:30,031
The police officer that stopped you

47
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,001
admitted that the prosecutor
told him to omit

48
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:34,735
certain elements from his report,

49
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:36,404
including the fact
that your back headlight,

50
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:38,807
the reason why he stopped you
in the first place,

51
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:42,507
wasn't blown out, but rather, had been
removed.. - The bulb unscrewed.

52
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:44,056
Somebody wanted me to get pulled over

53
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,127
with drugs in the trunk.

54
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:46,642
I told my first lawyer that shit.

55
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:47,822
They set my ass up.

56
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,900
It doesn't matter that you were set up.

57
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,156
It matters that the prosecutor
had material evidence

58
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:55,889
to support that theory
and hid those facts,

59
00:03:55,957 --> 00:03:57,184
- so the jury never knew.
- Okay.

60
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:59,935
The D.A. figured, Kanan's
young and black, he's guilty.

61
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:01,292
Who gives a shit about the rules?

62
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,677
This D.A. has a bunch of cases

63
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:04,955
under judicial review.

64
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:07,301
That's why you're getting out fast.

65
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:10,337
When?

66
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:13,140
Ain't you cold in that shit?

67
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,175
Stopped standing on the corner years ago.

68
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:17,477
Don't need no puffy
working from the inside.

69
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:19,346
You could do it too, boy. You're smart.

70
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:21,781
No, man. I love the streets.

71
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,950
I ain't trying to be no house nigga.

72
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:26,386
Change come from inside the house, Rolla.

73
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:28,120
Who the fuck want to change?

74
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:32,291
I heard Ruiz got hit.

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,828
Stabbed inside a motherfucking strip club.

76
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,796
God damn.

77
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:39,498
Strip club supposed to be
sacred, you feel me?

78
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,100
One minute you getting a good dick burn,

79
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:43,269
next, you getting gutted open like a fish.

80
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:44,737
Yeah.

81
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:49,275
Streets are saying you did it.

82
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:50,977
You ask for the weather report,

83
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:52,879
don't get mad when they say
it's gonna rain.

84
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:54,847
You believe what you heard?

85
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:56,915
If y'all was behind it,
we'd be at Ruiz's funeral

86
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:58,049
right now.

87
00:04:58,117 --> 00:05:02,521
But first Anibal, now this?

88
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:06,258
You can't blame niggas for wagging tongues.

89
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:08,159
Looks like you cleaning house.

90
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:11,363
Or you eliminating the competition.

91
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,067
'Sup, Em?

92
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:17,769
I told you to stop it with that shit.

93
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:19,137
If I was Eminem, I would be getting

94
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:21,139
my dick sucked by some actress right now,

95
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:22,774
not freezing my balls off
out here with you.

96
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:24,342
Yo, Rolla says folks are saying

97
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,311
we called the hit on Ruiz.

98
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,779
That's some bullshit.

99
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:29,013
I say we go by tomorrow

100
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,314
and make sure he knows where we stand.

101
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:32,049
I wouldn't walk in unprotected.

102
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:34,419
Soldados shoot first,
ask questions after the fact.

103
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,120
You want to come with me, Rolla?

104
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:38,055
I'll let you go in first.

105
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:40,491
- Good to see you, G.
- My man.

106
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,126
Night, Marshall.

107
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:44,261
Fuck you.

108
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,096
I never get why you like him so much.

109
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:47,531
He's loyal, and he's smart.

110
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,233
He's too smart to try some shit with Ruiz

111
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,168
without knowing our play.

112
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,869
You think cool runnings gapped off?

113
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,338
Gapped off about what?

114
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:55,472
Why would the Jamaicans brag
about a botched hit?

115
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,507
They didn't even hit Ruiz.

116
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:59,810
Owe us a motherfucking store credit.

117
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:02,045
I know Ruiz didn't check
into no real hospital.

118
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,079
Make sure you know where he's hiding.

119
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:04,147
We'll go there tomorrow.

120
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:05,816
Rolla is right about one thing.

121
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:07,216
If the Soldados suspect us,

122
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,885
they'll have itchy trigger fingers.

123
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,954
I better go alone.

124
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:12,288
No fucking way.

125
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:14,123
I ain't gonna let you get clipped

126
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:15,592
right before Tasha's birthday.

127
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,828
If the worst happens,
she'll never forgive me.

128
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:21,197
You forgot about her birthday?

129
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,032
Damn, man, she's your wife.

130
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,467
How come I remember, you don't?

131
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:28,037
I got a lot on my mind, Tommy.

132
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:30,974
Well, you're welcome.
I'll call you when I get out.

133
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,975
Do that.

134
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:43,185
We could've met you during the day.

135
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:45,120
This is the only time I could get away

136
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:46,555
without them knowing I was gone.

137
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:48,190
That's live, so from now on,

138
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,092
try to get yourself
near Ruiz and his top guys

139
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,860
when you're talking business.

140
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,996
Especially if they mention
Lobos or the distributor.

141
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,530
We'll be able to hear everything.

142
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,399
Everything, so take your jacket off

143
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,633
before you rub one out, okay?

144
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:00,135
I don't want to hear that shit.

145
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:01,569
I thought you were the reptile guy.

146
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:02,604
You were supposed to.

147
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:05,107
[Speaking Spanish]

148
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:06,453
[Speaking Spanish]

149
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,143
[Speaking Spanish]

150
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,546
If anything happens,
we'll be on you in 30 seconds.

151
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:14,215
It takes less than a second
for someone to pull the trigger.

152
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:15,884
Then we'll be 29 seconds late.

153
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:18,185
Fuck this.

154
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:19,521
Get someone else to be your snitch.

155
00:07:19,588 --> 00:07:21,890
Agent Knox is just fucking with you.

156
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:23,424
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

157
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:25,659
- You have my word.
- Your word?

158
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,496
I'll remember that when I'm bleeding out.

159
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:30,297
Look at it this way.

160
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:32,233
Either wear the mic, or try
your luck up at sing sing.

161
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,101
Pedos do really good up there, I hear.

162
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,602
- Fuck you.
- You flirting with him, Nomar?

163
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,603
Enough!

164
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:39,472
[Speaking Spanish]

165
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:43,410
You don't have a choice.

166
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:45,345
Fuck all of you then.

167
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:51,919
You're home early.

168
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:55,088
Figured you'd be at the club all night.

169
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:58,191
Wasn't at the club. I was with Tommy.

170
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,093
I'd ask you what's up with Tommy,

171
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:02,429
but you ain't gonna tell me anyway, so...

172
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,564
Well, I don't want your pretty little head

173
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,232
to worry about any of that.

174
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,234
I want you to concentrate
on throwing yourself

175
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:13,205
the biggest, best birthday
party money can buy.

176
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:16,475
I thought you forgot.

177
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:18,711
Now, you see that?

178
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,112
You thought wrong.

179
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,413
Mmhmm.

180
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:22,949
Yeah, well, it would've been nice

181
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,016
to know a couple of weeks ago.

182
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:25,384
But that would've ruined

183
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:27,486
the whole surprise now, wouldn't it?

184
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:29,955
Sounds like bullshit to me.

185
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:32,224
Look, baby, I had
this whole thing planned.

186
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,226
I did, and then I thought,

187
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:38,330
well, who better to design
your party than you?

188
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:41,733
You'd hate what anyone else
put together anyway.

189
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:43,402
You got me there.

190
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,003
I already called Kantos.

191
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:46,337
You and Lakeisha go down tomorrow,

192
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:49,140

193
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,276

194
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:54,345
Mm.

195
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:57,649
- Thank you, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

196
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:00,585
Okay, I promise I won't
break the bank, okay?

197
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:03,020
Don't make no promises
you can't keep, woman.

198
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:05,490
- I promise.
- Okay.

199
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:12,096
You can't sleep?

200
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:15,099

201
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,374

202
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:25,575
I know.

203
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:27,577
It sucks to hear your best friend

204
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:29,312
is cheating on your other best friend.

205
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,482
Skanks throw themselves at club owners

206
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,051
all the time.

207
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,486
He'll come back to his senses.

208
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:39,523
Whatever. I'm over that.

209
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,424
I'm fine.

210
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:43,226
It's just work stuff.

211
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:47,030
What time are you gonna be home?

212
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:49,032
I was thinking

213
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:53,136
I'd make you some Cincinnati Chili.

214
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:56,238
You know, over spaghetti, with cinnamon?

215
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:57,439
I bet you never had that.

216
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:59,042
Sounds fucking disgusting.

217
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:06,415
You... Are gonna eat it and like it.

218
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:09,451
Look, Hol, I...

219
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,155
I might be a little late tonight.

220
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:14,823
How late?

221
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:16,825
I...

222
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:19,061
you can make that shit
for me another night.

223
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:21,430
Another night?

224
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:23,399
You like having me around, huh?

225
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:25,834
Yeah, I do.

226
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:31,807
I need to go shopping today anyway.

227
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:33,341
I'll see what you got in the kitchen.

228
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:36,344
There ain't shit in there.

229
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:50,157
This box of cereal expired two years ago!

230
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:51,826
Told ya.

231
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,243
Tommy, what's this?

232
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,879
Cash.

233
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:14,381
No shit.

234
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:18,318
Thank you for that
comprehensive explanation.

235
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,653
From where?

236
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,489
From the club.

237
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,158

240
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:29,396
There are four more
of those in the kitchen.

241
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:32,398
You are a bank.

242
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,404

Fuck you, Tommy.

244
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:44,477

246

What? Nah, nah, nah.

248
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:58,791
- Uncle G bought me this suit.
- Sign of respect.

249
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,693
You must be stepping it up.

250
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,595
Yeah, and maybe
when you get out in a year,

251
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:05,898
you know, maybe I'll be somebody.

252
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:09,168
Maybe.

253
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:12,304
Hey, I hear motherfuckers
out there beefing.

254
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:15,473
Is it the Soldados, the Tainos?

255
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:18,743
- Um...
- It's okay.

256
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:22,447
It's safe to talk here.

257
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:24,882
- The Tainos got hit.
- Yeah?

258
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,584
Yeah, and somebody took Anibal out too.

259
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:28,286
- No shit.
- Yeah, yeah.

260
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:29,521
And Ruiz got hit.

261
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:31,690
Maybe in retribution or maybe not,

262
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:34,859
but I don't really know.

263
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:36,928
Why you don't know?

264
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:39,530
'Cause I don't ask no questions.

265
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:40,832
Your Uncle G pulled you in,

266
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,801

gonna make of yourself?

274
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:07,290
- I'm working hard.
- That's good.

282

283
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,581

284

Please tell Mr. Stern
that I called to set a meeting.

285
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:37,553

286

- It's your 30th birthday.
- Exactly.

292
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:55,804
And I want it to be grown and sexy,

293
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:57,306
but not with no ghetto-ass shit.

294
00:13:57,374 --> 00:13:58,973
Mrs. St. Patrick's right.

295
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,709
I was thinking we can come up

296
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:03,745
with a birthday shout out
at the top of every hour.

297
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:05,480
We can come up with a signature cocktail

298
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:08,316
or maybe even do a balloon
or a confetti drop.

299
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:09,518
First of all,

300
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:12,020
she's turning 30, not 13.

301
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:14,022
So enough with the
balloon stomping, all right?

302
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,723
And make sure there's plenty of Ciroc,

303
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,392
because that's all my people drink,

304
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,860
and no coconut
because I'm allergic to nuts.

305
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:23,398

00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:24,532
I really couldn't wait to see you.

307

- Yeah.
- I'm starting...

308

309

No, are you kidding? I got the room.

00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,001
He's finally asleep.

364
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,112
It's so hard to believe he's the same man

365
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,548
that grilled me on spelling,

366
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:35,484
grounded me when I got a "B."

367
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:42,056
God, he could be an asshole sometimes,

368
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,226
but now he's...

369
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:51,766
He's helpless, so scared.

370
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:02,677
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:04,679
I'm a mess.

372
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:06,980
Angie, is there anything I can do?

373

[Speaking Spanish]

374
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:14,755
I don't think so,

375
00:18:14,822 --> 00:18:17,824
unless you can make this all go away.

376
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:21,529
This is Holly.

377
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:22,796
Obviously I'm doing something

378
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:23,897
more important than taking your call,

379
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:25,532
so leave a message.

380
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,834
Hey, call me back.

381
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:29,903
If I don't answer...

382
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,107
Nevermind.

383
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:36,176
Just call me.

384
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:11,577
- Ruiz is expecting me.
- Yeah, yeah.

385
00:19:11,644 --> 00:19:13,778
I've got a nine on my waist.

386
00:19:21,987 --> 00:19:25,290
And one on my ankle.

387
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:36,667
Hold up.

388
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,711
Oops, I must have forgot about that one.

389
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:47,778
Who the fuck is you, Rambo?

390
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:51,249
Can I go see your boss now?

391
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,251
Come on.

He's here to see Jefe.

395
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:15,305
- He clean?
- Yeah.

396
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:16,807
All right.

397
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,942
Yo. Yo, we got a visitor.

398
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:41,164
You look like shit.

399
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:44,033
I can't go to a regular hospital.

400
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:46,869
Too many fucking questions to answer.

401
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:49,038
Gracias.

402
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:51,807
Can we talk alone?

403
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:53,208
They already patted me down,

404
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:55,911
took my gat.

405
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,862
Nice of you to visit. Where's Ghost?

406
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,150
She won't let me fuck her in the ass.

407
00:21:36,218 --> 00:21:37,752
Her sister will, though.

408
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,889
I been stabbed twice. I'd rather get shot.

409
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:43,457
It wasn't us, Ruiz.

410
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:45,459
- I heard different.
- We ain't got no beef with you.

411
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:47,161
You're drug dealers.
You got beef with everybody.

412
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:48,929
They say the same thing about you.

413
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:50,998
Maybe it was Anibal's people.
Maybe it was Rolla.

414
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:53,400
Neither of those motherfuckers
any love for you,

415
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:57,504
and really, nobody else wants you dead?

416
00:21:57,572 --> 00:22:00,974
You're a drug dealer too, Ruiz.

417
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,276
You got more enemies than you even know.

418
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:05,278
Look.

419
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:10,851
If me and Ghost was behind this hit,

420
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:14,387
I wouldn't be here right now,

421
00:22:14,454 --> 00:22:17,490
and neither would you.

00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,460
Can you clean it up?

430
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:57,862
Uh, uh, I don't know.

431
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:07,939
Would you even know if Ghost
put out a hit on me?

432
00:23:08,006 --> 00:23:10,174
Your compai's been acting
kind of strange tely,

433
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:12,376
going out of his way to be all nice to me,

434
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:14,312
but then not showing up
at meetings he arranges.

435
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:15,980
With all this bullshit going on,

436
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:17,482
he's trying to keep a low profile,

437
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,285
something you might want
to consider doing.

438
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:31,362
Celebrating my high holy day,
and this puta sticks me.

439
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,498
The hitter was a girl?

440
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:36,033
What'd she look like?

441
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:37,835
She looked like ice cream and sunshine

442
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:39,069
till she stuck me.

443
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:41,237
Great tits, beautiful ass,

444
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:43,139
Latin girl, strong.

445
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:45,041
A girl hit us too.

446
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:46,844
Anything else you remember?

447
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:50,313
I wasn't looking at her face, man.

448
00:23:50,381 --> 00:23:53,249
Light hair, curly.

449
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,918
We find this girl, we find out
who's been hitting us.

450
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:57,520
Oh, you're goddamn right, Ruiz.

451
00:23:57,588 --> 00:24:00,457
We in this together.

452
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,634
I haven't been back here since I left.

453
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,870
The Bodega got replaced, of course,

454
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:15,905
with this pet store.

455
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:17,339
But otherwise

456
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:19,909
just like the old days.

457
00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:26,882
I thought you could use a milk shake.

458
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:28,583
Hmm?

459
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:30,952
You think they still make
black-and-whites?

460
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:32,921
Well, that's why we here.

461
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:36,892
Only one way to find out, Miss Big-time.

462
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,360
Oh.

463
00:24:38,428 --> 00:24:42,197
Just give me a second, baby.

464
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:43,999
What's up?

465
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,600
- Are you on your way in?
- No, I'm having lunch out

466
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:47,035
in Forest Hills.

467
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:48,937
You just want to hear my voice? What?

468
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:50,572
Your wife's birthday...

469
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,641
you sounded serious,
and I'm trying to make it work,

470
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:55,610
but I'm gonna have to call in
more staff, pay overtime.

471
00:24:55,678 --> 00:24:57,111
Th's fine.

472
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,414
The other woman wanted 20 cases of Ciroc.

473
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,050
Yeah, whatever they need,
just do it. I gotta go.

474
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:04,552
Wait, there's one more
thing. Simon Stern...

475
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:07,221
just make it happen.

476
00:25:24,372 --> 00:25:26,173
Fuck are you doing?

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,209
Just staying close in
case he needs something.

478

while you were all rubbing asses.

480
00:25:33,714 --> 00:25:35,949
Who's the blanquito in there with Ruiz?

481
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:38,051
That's the guy who gets us the products.

You want to call your girlfriend and ask

486
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:49,128
if you can pretty please do
your fucking job,

487
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:50,429
you go for it, all right?

488
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:52,098

490
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:54,634
I'm getting a look.

491
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:57,436
Son of a fucking bitch.

492
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:14,653
Who would know a girl like that?

Anibal's dead,

494
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,325
I don't think Rolla would use
a female for wetwork.

495
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:23,662
- Lobos.
- Ghost don't think so.

496
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,764
You, Ghost...

497
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:29,200
Have taken your eye off the ball.

498
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:30,468
Nah, man.

Is he talking to some
club asshole over there?

out in Forest Hills.

00:29:24,704 --> 00:29:26,705
- He's in Forest Hills?
- That's what he said.

527
00:29:26,773 --> 00:29:28,239
Got off the phone in a hurry.

528

- Ah.

About you being a punk, a drug dealer.

530

Yeah, he remembers what he remembers.

531

He remembers wrong.

532
00:29:49,761 --> 00:29:52,463
You don't just become a good guy, Jamie.

533
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:56,600
To get where you are now means
you were always one inside.

You're always taking me someplace to eat

536

fatten me up or something.

537

No, it's different, though.

541
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:25,996
It's your body and your smile

and your mind, the way you think.

543
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:30,433
It's all of you.

544
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:34,804
It's not what you are. It's who you are.

545
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:37,240
Look, Jamie...

546
00:30:38,642 --> 00:30:40,443
Mmhmm, what?

547
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:42,612
Do you want to come over tonight?

548
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,882
What about Greg?

549
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:48,785
There is no more Greg.

550
00:30:50,053 --> 00:30:51,320
Hmm.

551
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:54,723
No more hotels, okay?

552
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:57,393
Okay.

553
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,695
Thank you.

554
00:30:59,763 --> 00:31:02,331
What are the odds?

555
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,799
My God, Tommy.

556
00:31:05,502 --> 00:31:07,770
- How you doing, Angie?
- Not bad.

557
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:09,571
- How about yourself?
- Look at you.

558
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:13,709
I'm holding my own, holding my own.

559
00:31:13,777 --> 00:31:16,478
Get me a black-and-white, large.

560
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:18,814
I was just visiting a sick friend of mine

561
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:20,248
not too far from here.

562
00:31:20,316 --> 00:31:22,984
He sends his regards, so I figured,

563
00:31:23,052 --> 00:31:24,585
why not pick up the best black-and-white

564
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:26,288
in New York on my way home?

565
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:27,722
I thought you'd be at the club.

566
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,291
What are you two doing way out here?

567
00:31:29,358 --> 00:31:31,726
Oh, you know, just
catching up on old times.

568
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:33,929
It seems like forever ago.

569
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:35,997
I'll never forget the time
you tried to hook me up

570
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:38,933
with your friend, the hot one, Italian.

571
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,302
Silvana, she had a thing for you.

572
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:43,370
Oh, not enough
to let me get to second base,

573
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,439
and trust me, I tried.

574
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:45,807
I got my hand up in there.

575
00:31:45,874 --> 00:31:47,775
She cancelled Christmas

576
00:31:47,843 --> 00:31:49,644
on your boy with a quickness.

577
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:52,647
Kicked me right out onto the street.

578
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:54,549
You know who would love
these crazy stories

579
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:56,951
about when we was kids?

580
00:31:57,018 --> 00:31:59,987
His wife, Tasha.

581
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:02,823
Tomorrow night, we're having
a big birthday party

582
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,857
for her at the club.

583
00:32:03,925 --> 00:32:05,426
You should come.

584
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:06,893
I work late Thursdays.

585
00:32:06,962 --> 00:32:09,529
Aw, too bad.

586
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:12,332
Another time.

587
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,633
I'm gonna go.

588
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:16,503
I don't want your ice creams to melt.

589
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:19,739
- Thanks.
- You got it.

590
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,341
Thank you.

591
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:24,611
- Call me later.
- You bet.

592
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:39,925
I think I'm just gonna catch
the train back to the city.

593
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:41,560
Angie, I'm sorry.

594
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,662
Sorry about what... that you're married,

595
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,397
that your best friend knows your wife,

596
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,633
that he mentions her name
casually in conversation

597
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:48,901
because he doesn't know
we're sleeping together?

598
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:50,002
I'm sorry about Tommy.

599
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,637
Forget about everything he said.

600
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:54,807
Look, I want to be here with you

601
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:58,477
and later at your place.

602
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:01,480
I'll call you, Jamie.

603
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,055
We had a shot, and I took it.

604
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,058
No, you jeopardized the entire
operation on your own.

605
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,059
Who knows when or if we would've had

606
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,693
an opportunity like that?

607
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,728
- And what if someone made you?
- Nobody made me.

608
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,196
- You're sure about that?
- Positive.

609
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,898
Because I know how to handle myself

610
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,634
on and off the field,
unlike some of us in this room.

611
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,436
Fuck you, Medina.

612
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:01,905
I'll have Ankie call
your S.A.C. Over at the D.E.A.,

613
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,640
get you sent back where you came from.

614
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,009
Oh, really?

615
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:13,716
Vaya. Take it to Frankie.

616
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:15,851
This way, um,

617
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,122
I can get a few things
out in the open myself.

618
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,093
Excuse me.

619
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:27,730
I did the best I could
to keep him from going in.

620
00:34:27,798 --> 00:34:29,098
He didn't even get a good look at the guy?

621
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:31,100
No.

622
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,107
I sent the audio to forensics
to see if they can clean it up.

623
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:40,042
We should hear something within 24 hours.

624
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,043
Yeah, well, I'll be here.

625
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:05,800
Reached Angela Valdes.

626
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:07,201
I'm unable to take your...

627
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:23,151
So...

628
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:25,253
Lunch was nice yesterday.
How was the rest of the date?

629
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,754
None of your fucking business.

630
00:35:26,821 --> 00:35:28,289
That's funny, since the other night,

631
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:30,758
you were all up in my business
about me seeing Holly.

632
00:35:30,825 --> 00:35:31,992
Look, when you get tired of this girl...

633
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,060
I'm not gonna get tired of her.

634
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:34,128
Okay, well, when you do,

635
00:35:34,195 --> 00:35:35,595
she's gonna get fucking pissed.

636
00:35:35,664 --> 00:35:36,897
She's gonna fuck up our whole club,

637
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:38,598
the money, every fucking thing, Tommy.

638
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,668
You worried about me fucking up the club?

639
00:35:40,735 --> 00:35:44,171
If Tasha ever found out that
you were nailing another broad,

640
00:35:44,238 --> 00:35:46,540
she'd blow up your family
and our whole fucking game.

641
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:47,940
She'd take you to the cops

642
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:49,809
just to see your
cheating ass rot in prison.

643
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:51,811
First of all, lower
your fucking voice, man.

644
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:53,880
Secondly, Tasha wouldn't
do that, and thirdly,

645
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:55,549
she ain't gonna know shit 'cause
you ain't gonna tell her shit.

646
00:35:55,616 --> 00:35:56,883
Oh, you're damn right
I ain't gonna tell her.

647
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,318
That don't mean she won't find out.

648
00:35:58,386 --> 00:36:00,554
I bet your phone
is full of texts from Angie

649
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:02,622
and cute little voice messages.

650
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,090
"So good to see you again
after all this time"

651
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:05,324
after I broke your heart

652
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:07,093
"and threw it in a fucking dumpster."

653
00:36:07,161 --> 00:36:08,995
- Forgot all about that, huh?
- It's different now.

654
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:10,596
Yeah, you're married.
That's what's different now.

655
00:36:10,664 --> 00:36:12,264
Look, I got the whole
situation under control.

656
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah.

657
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:16,969
You always think
you got everything on lock.

658
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:22,341
Ruiz says a girl stabbed him.

659
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:25,678
Same as hit Liliana and chased 'Bueso.

660
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:27,279
Ruiz says it was a Latina
chick with nice tits

661
00:36:27,347 --> 00:36:28,714
and long, light-colored hair.

662
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:30,249
Bet we could get a better description

663
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:32,351
if we could ask Liliana,
but, whoa, my bad.

664
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:35,754
We can't, since we had her iced.

665
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:37,723
Didn't know I knew about that, huh?

666
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,257
I been looking at that bitch for weeks,

667
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:40,826
waiting for you to say something.

668
00:36:40,893 --> 00:36:44,062
"Hey, Tommy, I know we agreed to kill her,

669
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,031
but I changed my mind."

670
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:48,366
That would've worked.

671
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:56,874
Thought she was more useful alive.

672
00:36:56,942 --> 00:36:58,610
I made a judgment call.

673
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:01,078
Now we can have Julio go back to Liliana

674
00:37:01,146 --> 00:37:03,180
to see if Ruiz's description
lines the fuck up,

675
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:05,182
- if she remembers anything.
- Yeah.

676
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:08,620
We gotta find this girl, man,
and who she's working for.

677
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,621
That's all that matter Tommy.

678
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:13,190
None of this other bullshit.

679
00:37:19,264 --> 00:37:20,965
Yo, G.

680
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:23,634
Angela was trouble before,

681
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,369
and she's trouble again.

682
00:37:25,436 --> 00:37:29,105
I just don't want
to see you get fucked up.

683
00:37:29,173 --> 00:37:30,307
That's all.

684
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,113
Hi, Shawn, we're almost ready.

685
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:38,915
Mama, you look beautiful.

686
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:41,084
Yeah, that's a real
nice dress, Mrs. St. Patrick.

687
00:37:41,152 --> 00:37:42,718
Thank you both.

688
00:37:42,787 --> 00:37:45,188
Raina, have you seen
my diamond hoop earrings?

689
00:37:45,256 --> 00:37:47,957
No, I'm smart enough
to stay away from your stuff.

690
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:50,794
But not smart enough
to figure out your fractions.

691
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:51,895
Did you finish your homework, son?

692
00:37:51,962 --> 00:37:53,729
Yeah, that's what I thought.

693
00:37:53,798 --> 00:37:55,431
Game off until you're finished, okay?

694
00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:57,133
- All right, let's roll out.
- Let me find my earrings first.

695
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:59,368
Watch your mama blame me for that somehow.

696
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:00,403
Join the club, dad.

697
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,771
Yeah.

698
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:03,105
Shawn, you went to visit your pops?

699
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:04,807
- How'd it go?
- Yeah, he's good.

700
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:06,709
I don't think he's eating enough, though,

701
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:08,678
so he's looking a lot leaner and
tighter from all the push-ups.

702
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,379
- Tell him I sent my regards?
- Of course.

703
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:11,781
And he sent his back too.

704
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:13,749
Cool.

705
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:15,184
Can you tell my dad I'm old enough

706
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,819
for Assassin's Creed now, Shawn?

707
00:38:16,886 --> 00:38:18,687
What you trying to do, get me killed?

708
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,323
Do your homework.

709
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,391
- Did you find them?
- No.

710
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:25,260
They'll pop up sooner or later.

711
00:38:25,328 --> 00:38:26,862
Come on, let's go.

712
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,363
Okay, you two, listen
to big mama, all right?

713
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,998
- Okay.
- I'll see you in the morning.

714
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:32,467
Good night, baby girl.
Take care of your sister.

715
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:33,968
You want to keep that PS3,

716
00:38:34,036 --> 00:38:36,003
you do your homework for real, now.

717
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:38,139
- Good night, babies.
- Good night.

718
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:57,490
How long you gonna duck my calls?

719
00:38:57,558 --> 00:38:59,826
Until you're straight with me,
there's nothing to talk about.

720
00:38:59,894 --> 00:39:01,728
It's just fucking money. Why do you care?

721
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:03,263
I have it. Enjoy it.

722
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:05,065
Tommy, if it was about your money,

723
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:07,334
I wouldn't be in these heels
and this slutty dress.

724
00:39:07,401 --> 00:39:09,903
I would be home on my night off.

725
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:11,237
Kantos made you come in for this?

726
00:39:11,304 --> 00:39:13,339
Let me talk to that little bitch.

727
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:16,743
Do you really not understand
why I'm mad at you?

728
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,911
You're mad because you don't believe me.

729
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:21,080
But that's on you, all right?
That's not my problem.

730
00:39:21,147 --> 00:39:23,349
Then why are you fucking
calling me all day?

731
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:24,950
You don't get to pick and choose

732
00:39:25,018 --> 00:39:27,152
what part of your life you let me into.

733
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,788
Look, Holly.

734
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:34,493
I'm not lying to you, all right?

735
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:38,830
- I got work to do.
- Holly!

736
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:50,776
We want to give a big shout-out

737
00:39:50,843 --> 00:39:52,210
to the first lady of truth,

738
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:54,045
Mrs. Tasha St. Patrick.

739
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:56,782
Happy Birthday, Tasha!

740
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:05,023
All right, let's make our way over

741
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,791
- to V.I.P., all right?
- Okay.

742
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:07,959
All right.

743
00:40:08,027 --> 00:40:10,461
Specl treatment, here we go.

744
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:14,565
Quick thing.

745
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:16,301
No business tonight.

746
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:18,168
But this is the kind
of business you want to hear.

747
00:40:18,236 --> 00:40:19,537
Simon Stern called.

748
00:40:19,604 --> 00:40:21,204
He wants to meet.

749
00:40:21,272 --> 00:40:24,141
Tomorrow morning.

750
00:40:24,143 --> 00:40:25,543
Happy Birthday, sis.

751
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,446
- Thank you, Tommy.
- Mwah.

752
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,815
Rather than give you
money, like I always do,

753
00:40:30,882 --> 00:40:32,382
figured I'd put some thought into it.

754
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:35,152
What?

755
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,356
Very nice, Tommy.

756
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,359
You went to the spa to buy this?

757
00:40:42,427 --> 00:40:44,995
Hell, no, I know a guy who knows a guy

758
00:40:45,063 --> 00:40:47,164
that had the hookup to a real fancy joint

759
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:48,932
with a sauna, jacuzzi.

760
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,468
Thought maybe you could get
a facial or some shit.

761
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:53,035
You didn't have to do this, Tommy.

762
00:40:53,103 --> 00:40:54,504
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I did.

763
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:56,238
You supported us for so long,

764
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:57,607
always had our backs.

765
00:40:57,675 --> 00:40:59,108
You deserve the best.

766
00:40:59,176 --> 00:41:02,011
Tasha, Tasha!

767
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:06,115
- Hi
- Hey!

768
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,287
What?

769
00:41:29,005 --> 00:41:30,138
I just want to say

770
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:32,107
Happy Birthday, Tash!

771
00:41:53,295 --> 00:41:54,529
I'll bright back.

772
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,440
Oh.

773
00:42:06,508 --> 00:42:08,275
Hey, Tasha, I was just about to come over

774
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:09,510
and wish you a Happy Birthday.

775
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:12,146
Where did you get those earrings?

776
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:13,414
These?

777
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:14,915
You stole them from my damn house.

778
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:17,017
No, I didn't.

779
00:42:17,085 --> 00:42:18,485
Shut your lying ass up,

780
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:21,121
and give me back my shit
while you still have a job.

781
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:25,092
Tasha, these aren't yours. They're mine.

782
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,294
Tommy bought them for me.

783
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:30,997
Good, then he can tell me that himself.

784
00:42:31,065 --> 00:42:33,232
Come on.

785
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:43,009
- What's going on?
- Please tell her...

786
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:46,612
You buy those earrings for her?

787
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,148
Yeah, I bought 'em. Why, you like 'em?

788
00:42:49,216 --> 00:42:50,383
I would've got you a pair too.

789
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:53,086
Yeah, I do like them.

790
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:56,355
They remind me of a pair I used to have.

791
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:58,958
Great minds think alike.

792
00:42:59,025 --> 00:43:01,627
Come on! I got a surprise for you.

793
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:06,498
Holly!

794
00:43:06,566 --> 00:43:09,234
Oh, just come on.

795
00:43:09,302 --> 00:43:10,603
Ladies and gentlemen!

796
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,270
Ladies and gentlemen,

797
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:13,572
I'd like to introduce
the lady of the hour,

798
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,609
Mrs. Tasha St. Patrick, to rock the mic.

799
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:19,544
I'm not singing
at my own damn birthday party.

800
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:21,045
Why not? Beyonce did it at hers.

801
00:43:21,114 --> 00:43:22,547
I'm not Beyonce.

802
00:43:22,615 --> 00:43:23,648
You would be in her group if she'd let you.

803
00:43:23,716 --> 00:43:25,350

your phone was broken.

822
00:44:40,357 --> 00:44:42,692
No, not broken.

823
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:44,760
I told you I would call you.

824
00:44:44,828 --> 00:44:48,064
Well, I couldn't wait that long.

825
00:44:48,131 --> 00:44:50,265
You're at the party now?

826
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,568
Yeah, but I'd rather be with you.

827
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:56,605
I think you mean that.

828
00:44:56,673 --> 00:44:59,408
You're there with all those people,

829
00:44:59,475 --> 00:45:02,277
and I'm here, alone.

830
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:05,514
But I'm alone too, Angie.

831
00:45:05,582 --> 00:45:08,483
You know, yes, I mean,
there's a lot of people here.

832
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,118
Most of them are supposed to be my friends,

833
00:45:10,186 --> 00:45:13,755
but I'm alone when I'm not with you.

834
00:45:13,823 --> 00:45:15,656
Can I come see you?

835
00:45:15,725 --> 00:45:17,759

Thanks, everybody.

841
00:45:39,448 --> 00:45:42,216
Give it up for Tasha!

842
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,795
Great party last night.

843
00:45:54,863 --> 00:45:56,563
How tired are you?

844
00:45:56,631 --> 00:45:59,566
I'm not. I'm ready.

845
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:03,303
Gentlemen, welcome.

846
00:46:03,371 --> 00:46:06,172
Thank you for venturing up here.

847
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,474
Pleasure, sir.

848
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:11,378
Ah, the elusive James St. Patrick.

849
00:46:11,445 --> 00:46:14,847
Simon Stern. Pleasure.

850
00:46:14,915 --> 00:46:17,517
Come in. Make yourself comfortable.

851
00:46:17,585 --> 00:46:20,519
Here, have a seat.

852
00:46:24,224 --> 00:46:25,724
Let me cut to the chase.

853
00:46:25,793 --> 00:46:28,594
Cynthia Sheridan took her business from me

854
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:31,898
to come to you and your club...

855
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:34,366
- Truth.
- Truth.

856
00:46:34,434 --> 00:46:36,669
That vexed me a great deal.

857
00:46:36,736 --> 00:46:39,571
- It wasn't personal, sir.
- Of course not.

858
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:41,774
But it made me think either you're stupid

859
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,709
and don't care about profit...

860
00:46:43,777 --> 00:46:45,544
because you basically gave

861
00:46:45,612 --> 00:46:48,647
the whole cow away for free...

862
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:52,250
or you're smart and have something I don't.

863
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,419
Other than the Cynthia Sheridan parties?

864
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,624
We have a full house every night,

865
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:02,227
another 500 waiting out in the cold,

866
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:04,896
two DJs on retainer,
a back entrance for celebrities.

867
00:47:04,964 --> 00:47:08,733
Something tells me
Simon knows our stats already.

868
00:47:08,801 --> 00:47:11,469
You're asking what makes us
more than just lightning

869
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,438
in a bottle.

870
00:47:13,505 --> 00:47:15,773
You're right, I am.

871
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:19,844
You're wanting to know
what I have to offer you.

872
00:47:19,911 --> 00:47:21,846
Well, you have to make me an offer.

873
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:29,920
I see.

874
00:47:33,591 --> 00:47:36,894
Holly! Hoy.

875
00:47:36,962 --> 00:47:38,929
Yo, Holly! Been looking all over for you.

876
00:47:38,997 --> 00:47:40,630
- Get in the car.
- Fuck you.

877
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:43,967
You stole from Tasha,
and I lied to cover your ass.

878
00:47:44,034 --> 00:47:46,903
Now get in the fucking car!

879
00:47:46,971 --> 00:47:49,239
What kind of fucking criminal are you?

880
00:47:49,306 --> 00:47:51,975
You owe me one now.

881
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:54,978
Come on, get in the car.

882
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:04,020
What the fuck you thinking

883
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:06,522
stealing from Tasha, my family?

884
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,391
I didn't think she would miss them.

885
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,360
Her closet, it's like
a fucking department store.

886
00:48:10,427 --> 00:48:12,428
It doesn't matter how much shit she has.

887
00:48:12,496 --> 00:48:13,796
She's like my sister.

888
00:48:13,864 --> 00:48:16,732
I told you that before
we went to their place.

889
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,368
Look...

890
00:48:19,436 --> 00:48:22,337
I like to take shit.

891
00:48:22,406 --> 00:48:24,940
That's just who I am.

892
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:28,778
I'm sorry, though. It was a dick move.

893
00:48:28,845 --> 00:48:30,913
You can rat me out to her if you want.

894
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,787
Whoa, where you going now?

895
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:42,891
All that money I found
in your place, Tommy...

896
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:44,526
that's not from the club.

897
00:48:44,593 --> 00:48:47,296
No, it's not.

898
00:48:47,363 --> 00:48:48,530
But if you're gonna be my girl,

899
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:50,899
I gotta be able to trust you, Holly.

900
00:48:53,035 --> 00:48:54,335
What I tell you,

901
00:48:54,403 --> 00:48:58,872
you... Can't tell nobody

902
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,941
'cause nobody else knows.

903
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:03,777
I want to know.

904
00:49:06,414 --> 00:49:08,882
Thing is,

905
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:12,552
I sell some dope on the side
to make a little extra money.

906
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,521
I'm a drug dealer.

907
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:17,890
I'm not fucking stupid.

908
00:49:17,959 --> 00:49:19,692
Your phone isn't ringing day and night.

909
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,794
You don't live in some shitty wackup.

910
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:25,531
And there's no way "some dope"
pays for a nightclub.

911
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,567
Whatever you're doing
ain't a goddamn hobby.

912
00:49:27,649 --> 00:49:29,380
Tell me the truth, Tommy.

913
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:32,905
I'm at the top of the food chain.

914
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:35,575
I got a crew of motherfuckers
hustling for me,

915
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:39,378
and we move serious weight.

916
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:42,715
If I go away, I go away for good.

917
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:56,395
You wanted the truth.

918
00:49:56,463 --> 00:50:00,432
Yeah, I did.

919
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,702
So what you think?

920
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:28,026
I am a fucked-up thief,

921
00:50:28,093 --> 00:50:31,996
and you are a crazy drug dealer.

922
00:50:32,064 --> 00:50:35,032
I think

923
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:38,402
you and I were made for each other.

924
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:08,965
You're here.

925
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:11,935
I'm here.

926
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,436
Unannounced.

927
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:17,006
I like the element of surprise.

928
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,709
You said you and Greg are over.

929
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:21,644
We are.

930
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,212
So can I come in?

931
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,714
I think that's a bad idea.

932
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,686
I saw Simon Stern today.

933
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:32,588
It went great.

934
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:35,591
He wants to have dinner,
keep talking about a future.

935
00:51:35,658 --> 00:51:37,126
Congratulations, Jamie.

936
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,695
I'm really happy for you.

937
00:51:47,136 --> 00:51:50,072
You're the first person I wanted to tell.

938
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:56,122
In fact, you're the only
person I wanted to tell.

939
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:38,985
When I'm with you,

940
00:52:39,053 --> 00:52:42,756
I can't hold myself back.

941
00:52:42,823 --> 00:52:46,292
I want to.

942
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,163
I want the reality to matter,

943
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:53,767
but it doesn't.

944
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:57,170
I just see you.

945
00:52:57,237 --> 00:53:01,174
I get wrong when I'm away from you.

946
00:53:03,743 --> 00:53:06,179
I need another hit to get right.

947
00:53:08,815 --> 00:53:11,850
Another hit?

948
00:53:11,918 --> 00:53:15,688
That's exactly how it feels.

949
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,925
[Speaking Spanish]

950
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,069
I was so committed to not seeing you,

951
00:53:30,136 --> 00:53:33,572
and then you just knock on my door,

952
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:35,607
and I let you in.

953
00:53:38,411 --> 00:53:42,681
A girl only has so much resolve.

954
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:44,216
Sorry.

955
00:53:44,283 --> 00:53:47,151
No, you're not.

956
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,321
What were you even
supposed to talk about anyway?

957
00:53:49,388 --> 00:53:51,323
Stern.

958
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,159
My meeting.

959
00:53:55,227 --> 00:53:57,795
Tell me.

960
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:01,699
Come on.

961
00:54:01,767 --> 00:54:03,267
Well, I don't want to get ahead of myself,

962
00:54:03,335 --> 00:54:06,104
but we talked about partnering,

963
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:08,339
expansion,

964
00:54:08,406 --> 00:54:10,140
Vegas, Miami.

965
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:12,376
Mm, I like Miami.

966
00:54:28,692 --> 00:54:31,394
Sorry, babe.

967
00:54:31,462 --> 00:54:33,396
I know.

968
00:54:50,147 --> 00:54:53,082
I don't want you to go.

969
00:54:56,887 --> 00:54:59,822
I don't want to go.

970
00:55:04,294 --> 00:55:07,997
I mean, is there any way...

971
00:55:09,732 --> 00:55:12,734
could you stay the night?

972
00:55:21,311 --> 00:55:24,313
Never mind, I know the answer.

973
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,348
Reality calls.

974
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:29,685
I wish I could, Angie.

975
00:55:29,752 --> 00:55:31,886
Hey, hey.

976
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:39,393
It won't always be like this.

977
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,395
Yeah, okay.

978
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,397
I promise.

979
00:55:50,038 --> 00:55:51,939
Thank you so much, Shawn.

980
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:54,241
I hope you got a chance to enjoy

981
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,477
some of the party the other night.

982
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:58,746
Yeah, I did.

983
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:02,983
Actually, um...

984
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:04,784
I got you a little something myself.

985
00:56:04,853 --> 00:56:06,753
Shawn, you did not have to do that.

986
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,021
You do enough already.

987
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:10,123
Nah, it's just a little something.

988
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:12,826
I hope it makes you smile.

989
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:22,435
I heard you say you lost
a pair of earrings, so, um...

990
00:56:22,503 --> 00:56:24,738
They're beautiful.

991
00:56:24,805 --> 00:56:28,007
But I can't accept them.

992
00:56:28,075 --> 00:56:30,943
I wouldn't want Ghost
to get the wrong idea.

993
00:56:31,011 --> 00:56:32,979
Yeah.

994
00:56:33,046 --> 00:56:36,315
Yeah, right.

995
00:56:36,384 --> 00:56:39,986
Excuse me?

996
00:56:40,053 --> 00:56:41,020
What was that?

997
00:56:41,088 --> 00:56:42,388
Shawn, what did you just say?

998
00:56:42,455 --> 00:56:44,456
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

999
00:56:44,524 --> 00:56:46,492
I mean,

1000
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,565
you deserve someone who's
as loyal to you as you are to him.

1001
00:56:51,831 --> 00:56:54,533
What the hell does that mean?

1002
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:58,537
He's always just putting
other stuff ahead of you.

1003
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:02,908
But what the hell do I know?

1004
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:06,278
I'm just the driver, right?

1005
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,018
I need men down in the garage

1006
00:57:13,085 --> 00:57:14,552
and at all the doors.

1007
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,454
Someone coming.

1008
00:57:16,522 --> 00:57:18,256
Security needs to be tight.

1009
00:57:18,324 --> 00:57:21,059
Who knows what this fucking
[Speaking spanish] has planned.

1010
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:22,093
Who?

1011
00:57:22,161 --> 00:57:23,428
I'm expecting Ghost,

1012
00:57:23,495 --> 00:57:25,263
the pendejo who supplies us

1013
00:57:25,331 --> 00:57:27,298
and most likely put
these fucking holes in me.

1014
00:57:27,365 --> 00:57:30,401
What this fucking

1015
00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:32,102
[speaking spanish] Has planned.

1016
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,471
Who?

1017
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:34,806
I'm expecting Ghost,

1018
00:57:34,873 --> 00:57:36,441
the pendejo who supplies us

1019
00:57:36,508 --> 00:57:38,342
and most likely put
these fucking holes in me.

1020
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,578
- You want me to frisk him?
- What do you think?

1021
00:57:40,646 --> 00:57:42,279
I'm telling you this piece of shit

1022
00:57:42,347 --> 00:57:43,948
tried to have me killed,
and you're asking me

1023
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:45,249
if you should see
if he's carrying a weapon?

1024
00:57:45,317 --> 00:57:47,284
What the fuck?

1025
00:57:47,352 --> 00:57:49,086
- [Speaking spanish]
- Has planned.

1026
00:57:49,154 --> 00:57:50,120
Who?

1027
00:57:50,188 --> 00:57:51,588
I'm expecting Ghost,

1028
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:53,490
the pendejo who supplies us

1029
00:57:53,558 --> 00:57:55,359
and most likely put
these fucking holes in me.

1030
00:57:55,427 --> 00:57:59,430
You want me to frisk him?

1031
00:57:59,497 --> 00:58:02,432
I'm expecting Ghost.

1
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:10,063
Previously on Power...

2
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:12,285
All that money I found
in your place, Tommy,

3
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:13,515
that's not from the club.

4
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:14,431
I'm a drug dealer.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,233
This D.A. has a bunch of cases
under judicial review.

6
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:18,626
That's why you're getting out fast.

7
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:19,220
When?

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,783
Leave Isabel alone, Nomar.

9
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:23,125
Looks like you're cleaning house.

10
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,010
Well, you're eliminating the competition.

11
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:26,504
I saw Simon Stern today.

12
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:27,289
It went great.

13
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:28,720
Vegas, Miami.

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,701
Mm, I like Miami.

15
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:32,142
If Tasha ever found out,

16
00:00:32,142 --> 00:00:34,045
she'd blow up your family
and our whole game.

17
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:35,386
I got you a little something myself.

18
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:37,116
I hope it makes you smile.

19
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:38,565
Celebrating my high holy day

20
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:39,767
and this puta sticks me.

21
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:40,802
The hitter was a girl?

22
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:41,836
We find this girl,

23
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:43,221
we find out who's been hitting us.

24
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:45,102
Try to get yourself near
Ruiz and his top guys

25
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:46,068
when they're talking business.

26
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:48,559
Especially if they mention
Lobos or the distributor.

27
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,257
Who's the blanquito in there with Ruiz?

28
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,858
That's the guy who gets us
the product, Distro.

29
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:39,540
Your party was over the top, "T."

30
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,584
Sure was.

31
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,860
I'm still trying to work through
that vodka hangover.

32
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:44,112
Oh, God.

33
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:45,647
What did your husband get you again?

34
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,898
He got her that new Celine Tote,

35
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:48,483
like Kanye got Kim,

36
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:51,152
and then something
a little more stimulating,

37
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,820
if you know what I mean.

38
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:55,623
So your man delivers
in accessories and in bed?

39
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:57,959
Shit, Tasha, that's a goddamn fairy tale.

40
00:02:57,993 --> 00:02:59,077
That's what I said.

41
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:00,995
It's just a life, y'all.

42
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:02,463
It's got its ups and downs
like everybody else's.

43
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:03,665
I want to know how he proposed.

44
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:04,667
I'm taking notes.

45
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,800
All right, well, take notes,

46
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:06,918
'cause I'm gonna tell the story.

47
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,469
It's my favorite story.

48
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:10,755
You know, basically, she was still a kid.

49
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:13,558
And one day, they were driving
down the New Jersey turnpike.

50
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:14,707
No, it was the BQE.

51
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:16,177
Okay, whatever.

52
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:17,679
And then the cops pulled them over.

53
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,180
So he leans in,

54
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:22,377
and he's like, "yo, I
got a piece in the car."

55
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:23,685
Why did he have a gun?

56
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:24,852
For protection.

57
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,904
You know how the hood was.

58
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,774
It was in the glove compartment.

59
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:31,526
As the cop's walking up,

60
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:34,696
I take it out, put it in my purse.

61
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,080
Cop searches him.

62
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,866
He searched the car, found nothing.

63
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:42,870
Cop walks up to me, eyeballs me.

64
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:44,922
I was never so scared in my life.

65
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:48,710
And then what happened?

66
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,094
He just walks away.

67
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,512
I don't know why.

68
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:52,930
I still don't know why.

69
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,265
We drove away, didn't talk about it.

70
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,218
I didn't even cry until we got home.

71
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,973
Two days later, he gives me this ring.

72
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,891
You a stone cold bitch, "T."

73
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:08,196
Ride or die.

74
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,115
Well, you know, he said
he knew he could trust me.

75
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,618
He knew he had my complete loyalty.

76
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,621
And I said as long as he gave me the same,

77
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:18,039
we'd be together forever.

78
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:19,907
I love that story.

79
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:22,243
It's like the first time,
every time I hear that story.

80
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,663
Now we got to figure out
how to get you a man

81
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:27,081
and a house and a ring,

82
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,216
'cause you didn't even understand

83
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,917
why he had a gun in the car.

84
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,886
I still don't understand
why he needed that gun.

85
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,634
Thanks for meeting me here.

86
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,269
I couldn't make it all the way uptown.

87
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:22,720
I still wanted to see you.

88
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:24,105
I prefer my apartment,

89
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,726
but being here has certain benefits,

90
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:31,279
like room service.

91
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:36,234
Mm-hmm.

92
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:38,069
Mm.

93
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:46,911
God, I wish I could stay here all day.

94
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:50,715
I don't want to go out there,
to the real world.

95
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:58,339
This, us, is real.

96
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,676
Woman.

97
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,812
You feel that way, too, right?

98
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,314
Hmm?

99
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:14,822
It's okay.

100
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:16,824
You can get it.

101
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,112
I'll call her back.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,036
What's she like?

103
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,923
Well, Tasha is...

104
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,013
Not you.

105
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,769
Hmm?

106
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:05,907
Oh, good, I'm glad you're here.

107
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,160
Do you mind if I borrow
your black leather jacket?

108
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,378
What?

109
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,413
It's Tuesday, laundry day.

110
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,831
Should I have called first?

111
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:17,335
Why start now?

112
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:19,420
No smoking in it, okay?

113
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:20,972
I'm still angry about the burn hole

114
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,173
that was in my sweater.

115
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:23,925
I quit three months ago.

116
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,977
Where you been?

117
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,929
Never mind, I guess I know.

118
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:31,015
Shit is so much hotter in hotels, right?

119
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:32,934
Manny took me to the Marriott once,

120
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:35,436
and let me...

121
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,321
I'm just glad you finally found a way

122
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,940
to get your fireworks with Greg.

123
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,524
I'm not with Greg anymore.

124
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:45,279
Y que?

125
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:46,311
You got some new hot thing

126
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:47,196
you didn't tell me about?

127
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,542
I didn't know what it was for a while,

128
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:49,760
so I didn't want to say anything.

129
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:52,346
What's his name?

130
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:54,760
It's Jamie St. Patrick.

131
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:56,228
From the old neighborhood?

132
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:57,596
I guess I never really let him go.

133
00:07:57,598 --> 00:07:58,764
I guess not,

134
00:07:58,815 --> 00:07:59,932
no matter how many times

135
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:01,567
papi chased him out of the house.

136
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:02,470
He was a punk.

137
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,799
_

138
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,522
Playing lookout for those gangsters.

139
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:07,656
He's changed.

140
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:09,325
He's not like that anymore.

141
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:13,946
You got it bad, don't you?

142
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:15,831
He's a good guy, Paz.

143
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:16,916
You'll see.

144
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,501
I sure will.

145
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:21,704
How about dinner?

146
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:23,956
If he's as great as you say,

147
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:27,343
it feels like I should re-meet
my future cuñado.

148
00:08:27,377 --> 00:08:29,512
- You'll ask him, right?
- I'll ask him.

149
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:43,642
We are not competition.

150
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:45,611
We are only old friends.

151
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:49,281
It should not take you so long
to come to friend for help.

152
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:50,533
Guns in the sauna.

153
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:51,901
You Serbians have an interesting way

154
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:54,537
of defining friendship, Vladimir.

155
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:57,373
They are overprotective.

156
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:59,575
What can I say?

157
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:03,396
Now, tell me, how can I help?

158
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:04,707
I'm looking for a gun...

159
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:07,877
actually a knife for hire,

160
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:10,880
a woman.

161
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:15,435
A white girl, Spanish, or a black?

162
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:18,721
Definitely Latin.

163
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:21,224
I do business with
a Haitian from New Jersey.

164
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,526
You must have conversation with him.

165
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,561
But he is a little...

166
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:26,612
Interesting.

167
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:28,614
You talking about Drift?

168
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,950
I got work with that motherfucker.

169
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,618
If he knew something about this shit,

170
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:33,953
he should've reached out.

171
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:35,571
When he and I worked together,

172
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:38,791
he knew who to call to eliminate a problem.

173
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:42,495
If she's out there, he'll know about her.

174
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,383
You heard from Stern?

175
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:48,418
No.

176
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,969
What, you getting nervous?

177
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:51,587
Just want to know what time
this dinner's gonna be.

178
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:53,473
Men like Stern are on a
plane half the year.

179
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:54,974
I bet his wife can't get a hold of him.

180
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:56,008
Good point.

181
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,677
He was impressed, boss.

182
00:09:57,728 --> 00:10:00,263
Don't worry, we got this.

183
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,598
I can get you two lovebirds a room.

184
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,434
I bet you'd like that.

185
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:05,768
Come on, get out of here.

186
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:08,237
We got grown man business to talk about.

187
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:09,489
I'll let you know if Stern calls.

188
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,524
Do that.

189
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:19,782
You see the triads?

190
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,667
Yeah, and the Italians.

191
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:23,336
Hadn't heard of her.

192
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,755
But the Serb told me
you should talk to Drift.

193
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,707
Aren't we supposed to meet with Drift

194
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:28,958
as soon as we squash all this shit?

195
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:30,426
I thought you two were cool, man.

196
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,711
Yeah.

197
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:33,247
You think he would've reached
out if he knew something.

198
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:34,528
So either he doesn't know anything.

199
00:10:34,562 --> 00:10:36,230
- Or we're getting played.
- Yeah.

200
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:38,479
And there's only one way to
fucking find out, Tommy.

201
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:39,846
Yeah, we got to go visit him

202
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:41,596
in his fucked-up house in Jersey.

203
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:43,030
Mmm.

204
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:45,282
Man, I hate going out there.

205
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:45,983
You're driving.

206
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:47,016
Come on.

207
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:48,184
I can't go with you, man.

208
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:49,351
I got a lot to do for this party.

209
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:50,569
Save it.

210
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:52,021
Look, go tomorrow. Take Julito.

211
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:55,157
I know he's doing runs today.

212
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:56,609
Whatever, man.

213
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,368
Angela.

214
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:08,037
We've been waiting for you.

215
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:09,538
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:11,457
It's good to see you again, Mr. Collins.

217
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:13,709
Good morning.

218
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,345
How do you feel about Detroit?

219
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:18,547
We're putting together
a border drug unit there,

220
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:21,267
want someone of your caliber on board.

221
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,384
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:24,053
I don't understand.

223
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:26,222
California appears to
have made significant headway

224
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:27,690
in the Lobos case.

225
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:29,725
An associate of his has been
arrested and might sing.

226
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:34,230
If he does, they may be ready
to arrest within the week.

227
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:36,732
They're shutting down our Lobos task force.

228
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:39,401
We're shifting funding
to other departments.

229
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:43,072
My father isn't in good health.

230
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:48,577
It's not a good time for me
to leave New York.

231
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:50,129
Frankie said you were ambitious.

232
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:51,664
I thought you'd jump at the chance

233
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:54,133
for a successful prosecution.

234
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,751
All right, look.

235
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:59,255
Barring a huge development
in your Lobos investigation,

236
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:00,806
I'm gonna need your answer about Detroit

237
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,224
by the end of the week.

238
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:04,260
Yes, sir.

239
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:15,487
Is it wet?

240
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:17,273
It is?

241
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:20,192
Oh, how wet?

242
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:21,493
Um, I got to go.

243
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:27,283
Don't even.

244
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:28,450
What the fuck?

245
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:31,337
He was just about to kill the doctor.

246
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:32,371
Ouch.

247
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:33,589
Bitch, are you crazy?

248
00:12:33,623 --> 00:12:35,143
You could lose your job for this shit.

249
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:36,208
It's, like, police brutality.

250
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,259
I told you before.

251
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:38,494
Nobody cares what I do to you.

252
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:41,293
_

253
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,183
You all right, bruja?

254
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:45,601
Something's got you shook.

255
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:47,916
_

256
00:12:49,356 --> 00:12:52,558
All these white boys look the same to me.

257
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:56,645
Besides, these pendejos are small time.

258
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:59,481
The hijo de puta you're looking
for ain't gonna be in here.

259
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:00,866
I gave you his name.

260
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,420
- What more do you want?
- His picture.

261
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:04,536
So until you find him, you keep looking.

262
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:18,834
Mrs. St. Patrick.

263
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,336
Hey, I got here as quick as I could.

264
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:21,670
I told you.

265
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:23,756
When we're alone, you can call me Tasha.

266
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:32,567
So where do you need me to take you, Tasha?

267
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,400
- That's up to you.
- What?

268
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:36,485
Look, I've been thinking
about what you said

269
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,354
when you tried to give me those earrings,

270
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,522
about Ghost, about loyalty.

271
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:42,358
No, no, I didn't mean anything by it.

272
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:47,529
Sure, you did.

273
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,864
And the way you said it,

274
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:51,834
seems like my husband
is seeing another woman.

275
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:53,952
And the way I see it,

276
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:55,565
if he's stepping out on our marriage...

277
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:02,544
Maybe I should, too.

278
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:08,851
Look, I know you said what you said

279
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:11,603
because you care about me.

280
00:14:11,638 --> 00:14:13,722
And I care about you too.

281
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:16,225
I mean, don't you think I deserve better

282
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:18,227
than to be kept in the dark?

283
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:25,951
You ever been to Detroit?

284
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:27,319
A couple times. Why?

285
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,987
You trying to go?

286
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,874
Not exactly a vacation
spot this time of year.

287
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:33,242
What?

288
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:34,460
No, nothing like that.

289
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:36,245
You okay?

290
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,546
What's up?

291
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:43,385
You think you can get out
again this week, for dinner?

292
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:46,755
Dinner time is tough,

293
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,640
because of the kids, you know.

294
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:50,592
I know.

295
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,761
It's just...

296
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:58,484
My sister found some hotel keys
in one of my pockets.

297
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:03,439
She asked what was going on, so I...

298
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:04,606
You told her.

299
00:15:04,657 --> 00:15:07,776
About us.

300
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:11,663
She wants to have dinner,
see how you turned out.

301
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,950
How is Paz?

302
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,288
Is she still borrowing money?

303
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:20,506
Never.

304
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:22,925
Exactly.

305
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,094
I remember her breaking your piggy bank,

306
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:26,962
so she could buy some damn candies.

307
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,601
I want her to see how much you've changed.

308
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:35,804
When and where is this dinner, woman?

309
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:36,939
Hmm?

310
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:38,474
I will be there, I promise.

311
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:39,808
Day after tomorrow?

312
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,977
You're lucky I like you.

313
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:47,866
You sure you want to do this?

314
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,619
I deserve to know what I'm up against.

315
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:52,654
What are you gonna do?

316
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:56,325
What you think I'm gonna do?

317
00:15:56,376 --> 00:15:57,576
No, that's not her.

318
00:15:57,627 --> 00:15:59,495
That's not her.

319
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:00,796
Hmm.

320
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,498
You know her name?

321
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:07,002
Angela.

322
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:13,342
Thank you.

323
00:16:13,393 --> 00:16:15,093
Good night.

324
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:18,147
Come here.

325
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:19,565
Hey.

326
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,436
I've seen her before, at the club.

327
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:26,071
Ghost was talking to her.

328
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:31,360
He said it was just a
friend from high school.

329
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,029
He told me... He told me not to trip.

330
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,864
I saw her, and he...

331
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:37,916
have a good night.

332
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:41,954
Just take me home.

333
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:43,372
Look, Tasha...

334
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:47,759
Just, please, take me home.

335
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,130
We need to start over from the beginning.

336
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:53,632
Consider Anibal.

337
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:55,551
Hermanos Tainos are well-connected

338
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:58,053
and have a lot of territory.

339
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,638
Dead.

340
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:01,139
Soldado Nation's just as connected.

341
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:03,058
And even though Lobos
told Ruiz to fuck off,

342
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,943
he still made an attempt at the throne.

343
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:07,646
And his punishment was being
aired out with a switchblade.

344
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:09,898
So Anibal is dead.

345
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:11,116
Ruiz is out.

346
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,734
Who's next?

347
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:14,486
We know Hermanos Tainos and Soldado Nation

348
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:15,988
are in Ghost's network.

349
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,906
So we need to revisit the geo-profile

350
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,908
to see what other crews
in different boroughs

351
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,410
fit the same criteria.

352
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:24,162
There are over 200 criminal organizations

353
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:25,797
in New York City that could apply.

354
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:28,083
It could take us days to narrow that list.

355
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:31,920
I'm sure you've heard the talk

356
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:33,672
about breaking up this task force.

357
00:17:33,723 --> 00:17:35,724
Frankie and Collins are
out of their fucking minds

358
00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:37,092
if they think I'm leaving this bitch

359
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:38,477
without getting Lobos.

360
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:39,678
Me too.

361
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:41,563
Not until we're done.

362
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:50,656
This voodoo zombie shit
freaks me the fuck out.

363
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,908
As you're unfamiliar with our religion,

364
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:56,695
I will forgive your disrespect.

365
00:17:56,746 --> 00:18:00,832
I was surprised to hear about your...

366
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,284
Troubles.

367
00:18:02,286 --> 00:18:05,287
You and Ghost run a respected network.

368
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,872
Word travels fast.

369
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:09,625
It made me reconsider
our fledgling partnership.

370
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:10,959
We'll get this handled.

371
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:13,262
We'll be back on track to do our thing,

372
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:16,548
if you're straight with me.

373
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,133
I have cousins in Miami.

374
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:20,135
A few years ago, they crossed paths

375
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:21,970
with a female Spanish hitter.

376
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:23,188
She was good,

377
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:25,274
put down five people in his crew.

378
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,977
Well, this crew that your
cousins had a beef with,

379
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,145
you got a name for me?

380
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,813
Rock Street Killahz.

381
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:34,816
And they're very, very
strong in Florida too.

382
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:37,152
Your friend Rolla, he
has street brothers there.

383
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:41,657
Should I make an offering for you?

384
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:42,791
I think you need it.

385
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:44,876
No, thanks.

386
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:47,996
Hey, yo, you gonna call Ghost?

387
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:50,165
Nope.

388
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:53,669
No?

389
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,721
Isabela, mi amor...

390
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:57,119
_

391
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:02,518
_

392
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:10,318
_

393
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:13,021
It's not a boy, is it?

394
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:16,274
It's definitely not a boy, papi.

395
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:19,361
Jefe, you have a visitor.

396
00:19:21,664 --> 00:19:23,332
Hey.

397
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:30,789
I wasn't expecting you.

398
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,174
I wasn't expecting to be here.

399
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,625
I got pressing business.

400
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:41,099
I got my crew on the
streets, shaking trees.

401
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:42,851
We got nothing on that bitch who hit me.

402
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:45,220
That's what I came to talk about.

403
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:47,689
I got it on good authority

404
00:19:47,724 --> 00:19:50,359
the people responsible for
hitting us and stabbing you

405
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:52,060
could be the RSK's.

406
00:19:52,062 --> 00:19:53,228
Could that be?

407
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:55,781
Soldados and RSK

408
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:57,115
always had beef.

409
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:05,240
Rolla's arrogant, headstrong.

410
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,794
I had eyes on him
since all of this started.

411
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:13,582
He's just the kind of man
that makes a move like this,

412
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,966
looks you right in the face

413
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:17,085
and points the finger
in the other direction.

414
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:19,921
The question is,
will ghost do what needs doing?

415
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:21,390
He'll do it.

416
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:25,260
I just need to talk to him.

417
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,262
He doesn't know?

418
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:28,764
You came to me first.

419
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:31,316
Ooh.

420
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:37,406
We are at a crossroads, hermano,

421
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,608
not just for everything we've worked for,

422
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:42,077
but for you.

423
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,080
Change is hard and sometimes necessary.

424
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,668
Maybe you should handle this yourself.

425
00:20:54,123 --> 00:20:55,457
Either way...

426
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,794
Needs to be put into the dirt.

427
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:00,295
And if you don't,

428
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:03,215
there's gonna be a body dropping
from RSK every day.

429
00:21:08,104 --> 00:21:09,387
What about the triads in the Bronx?

430
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:12,307
Too small.

431
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:15,026
Russians in Brooklyn?

432
00:21:15,061 --> 00:21:16,261
Russians working with Latinos?

433
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,479
I doubt it.

434
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:22,734
Nancy Drew, you're quiet over there.

435
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:26,071
Take a look at this.

436
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:27,372
RSK in Queens?

437
00:21:27,406 --> 00:21:29,374
The guy running the crew is named Rolla.

438
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:31,960
He's got one serious rap sheet.

439
00:21:31,994 --> 00:21:34,412
RSK has doubled in scope and influence

440
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:35,831
over the last six months.

441
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,132
What can do that?

442
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,801
Influx of cash, new product, both.

443
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:41,837
Lobos.

444
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,338
Suddenly, the RSK's are controlling

445
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:45,390
a huge amount of territory.

446
00:21:45,424 --> 00:21:48,143
Whoever Ghost is,
Rolla could be our connect.

447
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:49,511
It makes perfect sense.

448
00:21:49,513 --> 00:21:50,979
If Rolla is in the Ghost network,

449
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:52,848
he's either Ghost's next target

450
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,399
or at least knows who he is.

451
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:57,185
Either way, we need to talk to him.

452
00:21:57,187 --> 00:22:01,439
We might just save his life.

453
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:03,358
I know who's been going after us.

454
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:08,363
Rolla.

455
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,501
That's what Drift told you.

456
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:14,085
Okay, all right.

457
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,787
Get the fuck out of here
with that bullshit.

458
00:22:15,838 --> 00:22:17,038
You're fucking with me, right?

459
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,456
Cousins of Drift's in Miami

460
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:20,876
were iced by a Latin girl hitter
a few years back.

461
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:25,213
The crew that hired her
was a Miami set of RSK's.

462
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:27,465
Pretty straight line to Rolla from there.

463
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:34,940
That's not proof, Tommy.

464
00:22:34,974 --> 00:22:35,991
Ruiz thinks it is.

465
00:22:36,073 --> 00:22:37,793
He's threatened to go to war with the RSK's

466
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,894
unless we fix this.

467
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:41,279
First of all, fuck Ruiz.

468
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:43,115
I ain't never taken orders
from his snake ass,

469
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:44,950
and I ain't gonna start now.

470
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:46,868
And secondly, why would Rolla do it?

471
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:47,903
We've known him for years.

472
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:49,154
Come on, man.

473
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:50,822
Same reason two former corner boys

474
00:22:50,873 --> 00:22:52,040
looked Breeze in the face

475
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:53,408
and shot him in the fucking head.

476
00:22:58,047 --> 00:22:59,548
When you want that top spot,

477
00:22:59,582 --> 00:23:02,551
you're willing to do
whatever it takes to get it.

478
00:23:02,585 --> 00:23:04,970
Everything we've been through,

479
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:07,088
this is the only thing
that makes sense now.

480
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,308
I'm telling you, it's Rolla.

481
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:14,930
We're supposed to be partners
in this shit, 50-50.

482
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:17,933
You trust me, right?

483
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:25,824
You and me were sure it was Anibal.

484
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:27,442
And then you and me were sure it was Ruiz.

485
00:23:27,444 --> 00:23:31,279
See, Tommy, the problem is,
we can't be wrong again.

486
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,501
I'm not wrong.

487
00:23:36,535 --> 00:23:39,955
This is the priority now.

488
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:44,509
Not this fucking club or any other bullshit

489
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:48,463
that's been a distraction
from what we're doing.

490
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:53,602
This is gonna happen, one way or another.

491
00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:55,136
One way or another.

492
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:03,144
If you don't want a war,

493
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,196
there's only one way to stop it.

494
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:17,158
I'm not pulling that trigger
without proof, Tommy,

495
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,461
no fucking way.

496
00:24:19,495 --> 00:24:22,664
You don't believe me. Fine.

497
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:25,166
Get all the fucking proof
you need, if you can,

498
00:24:25,217 --> 00:24:27,669
by tomorrow.

499
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:37,679
Kill Rolla...

500
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:39,180
Or I will.

501
00:25:20,056 --> 00:25:22,724
Can't sleep, baby?

502
00:25:22,726 --> 00:25:24,309
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

503
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,482
Something on your mind?

504
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:34,235
Always.

505
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:40,075
You want to talk about it?

506
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:42,127
I got a big decision to make, Tasha.

507
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:48,133
What does Tommy think?

508
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:51,753
You know Tommy.

509
00:25:51,804 --> 00:25:55,090
He doesn't think.

510
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:58,560
He wants me to trust him, you know.

511
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:01,262
You got to trust the people
who've always been loyal to you.

512
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:08,436
Tommy's always been loyal.

513
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:10,238
Always has been, up until now.

514
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:24,335
Is there anyone whose
judgment you trust as much?

515
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,288
Anyone who's been on
your side all this time?

516
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:02,824
Big J, I need to send a package upstate.

517
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:22,844
Hey, yo, man, lights out
is gonna be at 9:00 tonight.

518
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:24,262
Whatever, man.

519
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:25,814
I turn them off when I turn them off.

520
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:43,665
What's up, K?

521
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:47,252
Must be real shit if you're
reaching out this way.

522
00:27:47,286 --> 00:27:48,703
Shit, I ain't get no
message like this since...

523
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:50,455
the Trenton Beef.

524
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:51,789
Well, you guided me right then, man,

525
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:53,208
and I need your ear now.

526
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,676
So what you need?

527
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,261
Well, look, man, I don't know if you heard.

528
00:27:56,295 --> 00:27:57,512
Someone's been hitting our crew,

529
00:27:57,546 --> 00:27:59,214
dropping motherfuckers left and right.

530
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:00,715
Now I heard rsk might be involved.

531
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:02,217
Hard to believe, though, you know?

532
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:03,384
Rolla a loyal motherfucker, man.

533
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:04,602
You made him what he is.

534
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:05,803
He wouldn't move against us.

535
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:08,189
Yeah, that's what I think.

536
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:10,558
But, you know, I trusted people
before and been burned.

537
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,726
I hear that.

538
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:12,594
Well, word's out.

539
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:13,634
I got to move on this shit today,

540
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,263
or I got a war on my hands, bro.

541
00:28:15,358 --> 00:28:16,525
Say no more.

542
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,943
Keep the phone close, all right?

543
00:28:17,978 --> 00:28:20,145
All right. One.

544
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:26,952
James St. Patrick here.

545
00:28:26,987 --> 00:28:29,321
Mr. St. Patrick, this is Simon Stern.

546
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:31,123
Oh, hello.

547
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:34,376
How does tonight work for you, 6:00 P.M.?

548
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:35,494
6:00 P.M. tonight is great.

549
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,162
Good.

550
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:38,998
I'll have my assistant
send you the address.

551
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,166
I look forward to seeing you
and your wife in a few hours.

552
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:44,470
Oh, and leave that sycophantic
boy wonder, Kantos,

553
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:45,671
at home, will you?

554
00:28:45,673 --> 00:28:47,423
Tonight is adults only.

555
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:49,058
Absolutely.

556
00:28:51,678 --> 00:28:53,395
You look like you just saw a ghost.

557
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,680
That was Simon Stern.

558
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:55,682
Dinner's tonight.

559
00:28:55,732 --> 00:28:57,516
What did I tell you?

560
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:58,734
He wants to partner.

561
00:28:58,768 --> 00:29:00,319
What time should we be there?

562
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:03,188
Not you, just me and my wife at 6:00 P.M.

563
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,406
Oh, shit, at 6:00.

564
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:05,691
I got to go make a call, now.

565
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:09,194
Well, have a good time.

566
00:29:09,245 --> 00:29:10,496
I guess.

567
00:29:13,844 --> 00:29:14,844
_

568
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:16,335
Dos.

569
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:50,402
Thank you for doing this.

570
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:52,287
I want you to like him.

571
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:55,407
He makes me happy.

572
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,209
I know.

573
00:29:57,243 --> 00:30:00,245
You cooking, it says a lot.

574
00:30:08,054 --> 00:30:09,588
Angie, how you doing?

575
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,724
I'm covered in flour.

576
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:13,759
- What's up?
- Stern called.

577
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:15,227
See?

578
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:17,429
You were all worried for nothing.

579
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,815
You're right, always are.

580
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:22,601
He invited me to dinner at their house.

581
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:25,154
It's tonight, Angie.

582
00:30:25,188 --> 00:30:26,321
I know.

583
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:27,523
I'm sorry.

584
00:30:27,574 --> 00:30:29,074
Look, I'll make it up to you.

585
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:32,361
I need to swing by the
house on my way back.

586
00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:35,114
But I can come by after, you know.

587
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:38,667
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

588
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:40,669
Focus on Stern tonight.

589
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:43,789
Yeah?

590
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,291
Yeah. Go kill it.

591
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:48,427
All right, thanks.

592
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:03,559
So it was a meeting?

593
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,777
That's why he cancelled?

594
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:06,478
A business meeting, yeah.

595
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:10,282
Pretty last-minute for a business thing,

596
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:11,483
don't you think?

597
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:12,568
Don't, okay.

598
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:13,819
I'm just saying,

599
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,537
doesn't it sound a little sketchy to you?

600
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:18,490
I know what business happens
last-minute at night,

601
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:20,159
and it ain't the kind in boardrooms.

602
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,743
If he wants to make you happy,

603
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:24,246
he has to get off the streets.

604
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:26,665
I know you said that
he's different now, Angela.

605
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:29,096
_

606
00:31:29,294 --> 00:31:30,494
_

607
00:31:33,256 --> 00:31:35,340
He's married.

608
00:31:38,178 --> 00:31:41,346
He's a businessman, legit,
aboveboard, real.

609
00:31:41,397 --> 00:31:43,232
I told you, he's changed
since we were kids.

610
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:47,352
He's just... Married.

611
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:48,570
The hotel keys.

612
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:51,523
Now I get it.

613
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:53,192
And you're supposed to be the smart one.

614
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,424
_

615
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:02,261
_

616
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:03,785
I know.

617
00:32:03,837 --> 00:32:05,537
I can tell.

618
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:06,705
But it's not enough.

619
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:09,208
It never is.

620
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:11,677
This isn't gonna be a happily ever after.

621
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:33,398
You look great.

622
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,733
Well, I'd hope you'd like it,

623
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:37,286
since you picked out
everything for me to wear.

624
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,570
It's an important night, Tasha.

625
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:40,739
We got to be on our A-game, all right?

626
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,208
We got to handle tonight,
so we earn a tomorrow.

627
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:44,409
So go easy on the drinking.

628
00:32:45,913 --> 00:32:47,746
I don't need these people seeing you tipsy.

629
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:48,830
And if the wife wants to get chatty,

630
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:49,882
just play along with it.

631
00:32:49,883 --> 00:32:51,250
I won't embarrass you.

632
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:53,752
Okay, Ghost?

633
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:55,921
Ah, I take it this is the lovely

634
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:57,923
Mrs. St. Patrick.

635
00:32:57,974 --> 00:33:00,976
James didn't mention your beauty.

636
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,511
This is my wife, Madeline.

637
00:33:02,562 --> 00:33:03,679
Oh, hello.

638
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,980
Your home is beautiful.

639
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:06,515
Oh, thank you.

640
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:07,900
The place in Boca feels more like home,

641
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:09,568
but here we are.

642
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:10,602
Mrs. Stern, pleasure.

643
00:33:10,604 --> 00:33:12,521
Likewise.

644
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:14,356
Darling, why don't you take
Mrs. St. Patrick on the tour?

645
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:16,408
James and I have some
business to talk about.

646
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:17,776
Trust me, you do not want to be here

647
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:19,027
when they talk about business.

648
00:33:19,028 --> 00:33:20,779
You will fall asleep.

649
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,950
My wife is beautiful, isn't she?

650
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:26,952
Yes, sir.

651
00:33:26,954 --> 00:33:28,337
It's expected, you know.

652
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:29,538
We have to play the part.

653
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:31,957
They have to look the part.

654
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:33,759
It all gets so goddamn
boring after a while.

655
00:33:35,044 --> 00:33:38,547
Ah, Perrier-Jouet, 1825.

656
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:40,382
Oh, no thank you.

657
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:42,467
A club owner who doesn't drink.

658
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,969
How curious.

659
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,889
You are full of surprises, Mr. St. Patrick.

660
00:33:47,941 --> 00:33:50,859
I've invited another couple to join us,

661
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:52,811
one of my lieutenants and his wife.

662
00:33:52,862 --> 00:33:54,529
Todd and...

663
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:55,731
- Sandra.
- Sandra.

664
00:33:55,782 --> 00:33:56,949
This is James St. Patrick.

665
00:33:56,983 --> 00:33:58,700
- Todd, Sandra.
- Pleasure.

666
00:33:58,735 --> 00:33:59,901
The pleasure's mine.

667
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:01,870
This is the young upstart

668
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:04,539
who stole our Cynthia Sheridan parties.

669
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:05,791
That is me.

670
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:08,493
It certainly is.

671
00:34:08,495 --> 00:34:09,594
Dinner.

672
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:10,545
How about food?

673
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,880
Let's eat.

674
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:25,753
_

675
00:34:42,745 --> 00:34:44,830
I need you to meet me in 30 minutes.

676
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:49,868
So then he asked, "do yachts like to sink?"

677
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,537
Oh, God, it's so much
better once they leave.

678
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:54,589
God knows they don't want to talk to us.

679
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:56,425
And we do not want to talk to them.

680
00:34:57,677 --> 00:34:59,628
Sweetie, those are so pretty.

681
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,463
Are they new?

682
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:02,681
$15,000.

683
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:03,932
Didn't bat an eye.

684
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:06,018
You should've got him for at least 30.

685
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:08,053
Price they pay for the time away.

686
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:11,390
Should've been 50
for that new club location

687
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:14,109
he's been investigating on the side.

688
00:35:14,143 --> 00:35:15,894
It's so funny how
they think you don't know.

689
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:17,062
Oh, no, they know you know.

690
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:18,697
They just don't care.

691
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:19,948
Mm.

692
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:21,566
That's the spirit.

693
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:23,035
The only way to get through these things

694
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:24,403
is to stay drunk.

695
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:27,072
Cheers.

696
00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:28,957
Can I ask you something?

697
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:30,742
Can I touch your hair?

698
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:32,577
I just think it's fascinating.

699
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:42,170
Excuse me for a second.

700
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:50,145
- So pretty.
- So cute.

701
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:51,930
Darling.

702
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:53,899
Back when I was still
in the clubs day-to-day,

703
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:57,936
the ideal mix was models, actors,

704
00:35:57,938 --> 00:35:59,988
the musicians, of course,

705
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:02,607
politicians hoping not to get caught,

706
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:04,776
gays, drag queens,

707
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:08,997
those smooth, hairless young men.

708
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:10,782
Anything went.

709
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:13,618
A buffet of pleasures, really.

710
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,122
That was before aids came in
and ruined everything.

711
00:36:17,173 --> 00:36:18,173
I digress.

712
00:36:18,174 --> 00:36:20,592
My point is, times have changed.

713
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:23,462
A truly successful mix now involves

714
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:28,467
a certain element that I
admit I am less familiar with.

715
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:30,185
African-Americans and Latinos

716
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:32,187
have begun to have real purchasing power.

717
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:33,939
They're dictating the marketplace,

718
00:36:33,973 --> 00:36:36,641
not just influencing it.

719
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:39,644
How do you get the blacks and the Latins

720
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:44,616
to show up night after night and behave?

721
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,152
Mixing with the club kids
and the socialites.

722
00:36:47,203 --> 00:36:50,822
And on top of that, take my
Cynthia Sheridan business.

723
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:54,159
Guys with your background
usually open clubs uptown

724
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,961
or in Brooklyn

725
00:36:55,995 --> 00:37:00,966
and open and close within
a week, but not you.

726
00:37:03,386 --> 00:37:04,836
What's your secret?

727
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:08,173
No details, just your philosophy.

728
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:11,593
There is no secret, just me.

729
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:14,262
I don't follow.

730
00:37:14,313 --> 00:37:16,064
Well, I'm a black man from the hood.

731
00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:18,600
Most of the guys I came up with
are either dead or in jail.

732
00:37:18,651 --> 00:37:20,018
I live in the penthouse of my building,

733
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:21,520
above the lawyers and doctors

734
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:24,239
trying to get into my club.

735
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:26,658
See, people take you at face value, Simon.

736
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:28,160
Me, well, I have to transform

737
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:31,947
to meet everyone's expectations constantly.

738
00:37:31,998 --> 00:37:35,667
Truth isn't one thing,
because I'm not one thing.

739
00:37:35,701 --> 00:37:36,952
You understand?

740
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:38,703
I take all my experiences and use them

741
00:37:38,754 --> 00:37:43,542
to cater to all different kinds
of people, under one roof.

742
00:37:43,593 --> 00:37:45,260
Whether it's the black
professional athlete,

743
00:37:45,294 --> 00:37:46,878
ordering his next bottle of Ciroc,

744
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,680
or whether it's
the wall street motherfucker

745
00:37:48,714 --> 00:37:50,882
getting blackout drunk
on the company's dime,

746
00:37:50,884 --> 00:37:51,884
I understand him.

747
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:53,051
I get him.

748
00:37:53,102 --> 00:37:57,055
And because I get him... I get him.

749
00:37:57,057 --> 00:38:01,276
And because I get him, I get rich.

750
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:04,946
Okay, I want to hear details.

751
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,231
I want your offer.

752
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:17,242
$6 million dollars.

753
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:19,711
$6 million dollars.

754
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:21,046
To open the next club?

755
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,214
No, to own it outright,

756
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:23,582
to add it to my brand.

757
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:29,087
Truth is not for sale, Simon.

758
00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:30,972
James, once you get started,

759
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:32,641
you won't even have time for Truth.

760
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:34,976
You're gonna be seeing
so much of this world,

761
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:36,761
working for me.

762
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:38,364
You're gonna forget all about that club.

763
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:42,100
Working for you?

764
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:44,769
As one of my executives in training.

765
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:46,438
I'll bring you into management.

766
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,941
Maybe you'll replace Todd here
as my right hand.

767
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:51,776
Maybe.

768
00:38:51,827 --> 00:38:55,780
I told you, I'm "the secret"
to Truth's success.

769
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:58,783
I don't need training to be myself.

770
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:00,752
I came here to discuss a partnership.

771
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:06,041
Partnership with you?

772
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:07,792
No.

773
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:13,965
You may be talented, but you're not ready.

774
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:17,769
But since you are so unique,

775
00:39:17,803 --> 00:39:19,804
you come on,

776
00:39:19,806 --> 00:39:22,390
I'll let you report directly to me.

777
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:25,143
My husband doesn't report to anyone.

778
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,947
Oh.

779
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:30,482
Is that how you feel, James?

780
00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:37,289
Simon, I didn't get where I amby following.

781
00:39:37,323 --> 00:39:39,324
I lead.

782
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:41,459
I urge you to reconsider partnership,

783
00:39:41,494 --> 00:39:44,129
because if I walk out of that door,

784
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:46,881
I turn from potential ally
back to competitor,

785
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:50,001
and I don't think you want that.

786
00:39:50,003 --> 00:39:51,469
I don't think you want that, either.

787
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:55,473
I'll take my chances.

788
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:58,143
Thank you for your hospitality.

789
00:39:58,177 --> 00:40:00,261
May the best man win.

790
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:01,730
I will.

791
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:06,351
Todd.

792
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:08,770
Mrs. St. Patrick, you're a feisty one.

793
00:40:08,821 --> 00:40:09,988
I like that.

794
00:40:10,022 --> 00:40:11,323
Mm-hmm.

795
00:40:13,192 --> 00:40:14,359
Don't worry, baby.

796
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,027
You did the right thing.

797
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:17,696
It wasn't your call to speak for me, Tasha.

798
00:40:17,747 --> 00:40:18,830
It's my decision to make.

799
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:21,916
There was no decision.

800
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:24,119
You're nobody's fucking
number two, are you?

801
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,171
I mean, I don't even know
why the hell we went up there

802
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:27,189
in the first place.

803
00:40:27,204 --> 00:40:29,038
You know that white man wasn't
gonna see you as no partner.

804
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:30,289
The fuck you want from me, Tasha?

805
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:31,924
What you want me to do?

806
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,459
You want me to stay the same
and never change?

807
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,127
It ever occur to you I ain't
the same street nigger

808
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:36,295
you married anymore?

809
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:41,217
Who's that?

810
00:40:41,268 --> 00:40:42,301
Kanan.

811
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:44,603
Hmph.

812
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:47,356
Seems like the same old Ghost to me.

813
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,024
What's up, man?

814
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:51,026
You ain't gonna like what I got to say, G.

815
00:40:51,061 --> 00:40:52,978
You was right about Rolla.

816
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:54,280
Little nigger put up 100 thou

817
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:55,591
for anybody who could help link him

818
00:40:55,615 --> 00:40:56,866
with an out-of-town hitter.

819
00:40:57,714 --> 00:40:59,131
Said he wanted top of the line,

820
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:02,851
no mistakes, to take down
your whole network.

821
00:41:02,886 --> 00:41:04,353
$100,000.

822
00:41:06,222 --> 00:41:07,473
Yeah, that's what they're saying.

823
00:41:07,524 --> 00:41:09,275
Damn.

824
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:11,777
Some of my niggers in here
got connections down in Miami.

825
00:41:11,811 --> 00:41:14,280
They said Rolla took a trip
down there about a month ago,

826
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:15,648
met up with his brothers down there.

827
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:17,283
They introduced him to a Latin girl,

828
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:20,119
hot piece of ass they said
knows her way around a knife.

829
00:41:20,153 --> 00:41:22,738
Bitch wear these crazy-ass pink
sneakers everywhere she goes,

830
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:24,373
don't even take them off to fuck, man.

831
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:26,742
That's the chick we've
been looking for, man.

832
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:29,244
Rolla know he in trouble,

833
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:32,164
so he already moving around
a little different.

834
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,833
He's hiding out on Long Island,
some bitch's place.

835
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:37,169
I know exactly where it is.

836
00:41:37,171 --> 00:41:38,337
Look, k, good looking out, man.

837
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:39,755
Keep your head up, all right?

838
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:41,173
All right.

839
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:43,092
I'm sorry it turned out like this, G.

840
00:41:45,011 --> 00:41:48,347
One.

841
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:49,848
Shawn, I need you to take Tasha home.

842
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:51,900
I got to make a stop.

843
00:41:57,107 --> 00:41:59,408
I said 30 minutes, Nomar.

844
00:41:59,442 --> 00:42:02,911
Couldn't wait, huh?

845
00:42:02,946 --> 00:42:05,247
I'm beginning to think
you get lonely without me.

846
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:07,783
Who's this?

847
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,248
_

848
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:22,047
Rolla, boss of the Rock Street Assholes.

849
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:23,766
Is he involved with Lobos?

850
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,517
There's no way he's got
a blanquito in his crew

851
00:42:25,552 --> 00:42:27,353
who might go by Ghost?

852
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:29,221
No.

853
00:42:29,223 --> 00:42:31,774
No white guys in the RSK's.

854
00:42:31,808 --> 00:42:34,893
As for Lobos, I know Rolla
has history with Ruiz,

855
00:42:34,944 --> 00:42:37,896
long-standing shit.

856
00:42:37,947 --> 00:42:39,531
But we're under strict instructions

857
00:42:39,566 --> 00:42:41,567
not to mess with the RSK's
if we see them on the streets.

858
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:43,452
Like a professional courtesy?

859
00:42:43,486 --> 00:42:46,121
Don't antagonize the other
dealers in the network?

860
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:48,290
I can't see another reason
why Ruiz would keep us

861
00:42:48,324 --> 00:42:52,161
from stomping these motherfuckers out.

862
00:42:52,212 --> 00:42:54,296
Where can I find this guy?

863
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:58,550
We went to his last known,
and he wasn't there.

864
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:00,586
I can find out where he is.

865
00:43:00,588 --> 00:43:03,138
He's got Poncho keeping tabs
on everybody he's pissed at,

866
00:43:03,173 --> 00:43:05,090
just in case.

867
00:43:05,141 --> 00:43:06,392
I'll call him.

868
00:43:06,426 --> 00:43:07,643
Don't ask too much.

869
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:13,399
I won't.

870
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,267
Gracias, Nomar.

871
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:20,233
_

872
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,157
Make the call.

873
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:56,558
Try calling my cell.

874
00:43:56,609 --> 00:43:57,976
What?

875
00:43:57,978 --> 00:43:59,862
Call my cell.

876
00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:14,076
You're scaring me, Tommy.

877
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:15,494
What's going on?

878
00:44:15,545 --> 00:44:18,497
You can tell me.

879
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:24,553
James was supposed to

880
00:44:24,587 --> 00:44:31,894
do something for me tonight.

881
00:44:34,264 --> 00:44:36,148
Son of a bitch better do it tonight.

882
00:44:44,634 --> 00:44:45,634
Do you think he's gonna do it?

883
00:44:45,658 --> 00:44:48,944
No.

884
00:44:48,995 --> 00:44:54,249
We used to do everything
together, side-by-side.

885
00:44:57,253 --> 00:44:59,004
Something's changed.

886
00:44:59,038 --> 00:45:00,672
He ain't the same.

887
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:07,713
You ever think you don't need him anymore?

888
00:45:07,764 --> 00:45:11,049
I mean, if you don't trust him
to do this thing tonight...

889
00:45:11,051 --> 00:45:13,352
if I can't trust him?

890
00:45:17,524 --> 00:45:21,143
Then I don't know.

891
00:45:21,194 --> 00:45:22,561
I don't fucking know.

892
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:28,283
If you can't trust him, baby,
you can trust me.

893
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,622
Come here.

894
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,488
As soon as you get back with my food,

895
00:46:06,522 --> 00:46:08,407
I'll put this long nine on you.

896
00:46:08,441 --> 00:46:10,275
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

897
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:13,195
Better hurry up with my food, yo.

898
00:46:43,526 --> 00:46:45,143
I'd offer you a drink,

899
00:46:45,194 --> 00:46:47,479
but we both know you won't take it.

900
00:46:52,151 --> 00:46:53,871
They say we're gonna get
ten inches tonight.

901
00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:57,155
That what they say, huh?

902
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:04,246
Well, then we should probably
get to it then.

903
00:47:09,802 --> 00:47:11,219
You don't want to know why?

904
00:47:11,254 --> 00:47:14,306
We here now.

905
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,308
Knowing why ain't gonna make no nevermind.

906
00:47:21,347 --> 00:47:24,566
I know it's been you hitting
us from the inside, Rolla,

907
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,352
smiling in my face
the whole fucking time, man.

908
00:47:27,354 --> 00:47:29,688
You actually said that shit
like you truly believe it.

909
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:30,822
I do.

910
00:47:30,857 --> 00:47:32,441
No, you don't.

911
00:47:32,492 --> 00:47:33,859
'Cause if you did, my black ass

912
00:47:33,861 --> 00:47:35,861
wouldn't even got a chance to sit down.

913
00:47:35,912 --> 00:47:38,163
I'm offering you a chance to come clean.

914
00:47:38,197 --> 00:47:39,614
No, that ain't it.

915
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:42,784
You're offering me
a chance to convince you.

916
00:47:42,835 --> 00:47:44,536
Okay, I'll play along.

917
00:47:44,538 --> 00:47:47,706
So you're saying I hit your shipment.

918
00:47:47,757 --> 00:47:49,841
I killed fat ass Anibal.

919
00:47:49,876 --> 00:47:52,427
I stabbed Ruiz.

920
00:47:52,462 --> 00:47:53,462
And what else I do?

921
00:47:53,513 --> 00:47:54,763
A few weeks ago,

922
00:47:54,797 --> 00:47:56,477
you had a courier of mine jumped, a woman.

923
00:47:59,552 --> 00:48:01,636
Oh, damn.

924
00:48:01,688 --> 00:48:03,472
I've been a busy motherfucker.

925
00:48:03,523 --> 00:48:04,723
And we know about the hitter you hired,

926
00:48:04,774 --> 00:48:08,193
a female, Latina.

927
00:48:08,227 --> 00:48:10,645
A bitch?

928
00:48:10,697 --> 00:48:13,482
Me?

929
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:14,700
That's a tall tale, G.

930
00:48:14,734 --> 00:48:16,401
Don't fuck with me, boy.

931
00:48:18,621 --> 00:48:20,238
Ruiz is down to go to war.

932
00:48:20,289 --> 00:48:21,406
Tommy is convinced.

933
00:48:21,457 --> 00:48:23,208
Don't fuck with me.

934
00:48:23,242 --> 00:48:25,127
Heard you went through
your brothers in Miami

935
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:26,244
to hire the chick.

936
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:29,498
Yeah, I went to Miami, sure,

937
00:48:29,549 --> 00:48:32,417
and got a goddamn tan.

938
00:48:32,419 --> 00:48:34,169
I didn't get no hitter in a skirt.

939
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:42,594
Look me in the eyes like a man.

940
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:47,766
Tell me you did it.

941
00:48:47,768 --> 00:48:50,485
Just own the shit.

942
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,772
I can't do it, Captain.

943
00:48:53,774 --> 00:48:54,774
I get Ruiz.

944
00:48:54,824 --> 00:48:56,408
Yeah, his bitch ass go bye-bye,

945
00:48:56,442 --> 00:48:59,244
I'm gonna be on them corners, no doubt.

946
00:48:59,278 --> 00:49:00,912
And Eminem, well, shit,

947
00:49:00,947 --> 00:49:03,448
we both know he ain't never liked me.

948
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,617
But neither of them bring
you to shooting a boy

949
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:07,702
you raised from the streets, do they?

950
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,291
It's Kanan, right?

951
00:49:13,293 --> 00:49:14,533
You and that crazy motherfucker

952
00:49:14,544 --> 00:49:16,511
still tight after all these years.

953
00:49:16,546 --> 00:49:19,514
Shit, you trust him more
than anybody, even Tommy.

954
00:49:19,549 --> 00:49:21,383
The question is, G,

955
00:49:21,434 --> 00:49:22,851
what the fuck do he gain from
pointing you in my direction?

956
00:49:22,885 --> 00:49:25,554
He don't gain a motherfucking anything.

957
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:31,610
He's my friend.

958
00:49:34,397 --> 00:49:36,815
I'm your friend.

959
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:40,786
I am your friend.

960
00:49:55,334 --> 00:49:57,719
Said we're supposed to get
ten inches tonight, huh?

961
00:50:45,468 --> 00:50:46,635
Still pretty warm.

962
00:50:46,686 --> 00:50:48,470
- Carajo.
- Yeah.

963
00:50:54,477 --> 00:50:55,861
I'll call NYPD.

964
00:50:55,895 --> 00:50:57,562
Maybe the killer's still in the area.

965
00:53:21,957 --> 00:53:24,709
Thanks, girl.

966
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:28,013
So he wasn't prince charming after all.

967
00:53:28,047 --> 00:53:30,548
Unless princey was a two-timing nigger.

968
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,050
Have you confronted his worthless ass?

969
00:53:32,052 --> 00:53:33,218
Keisha, you don't...

970
00:53:33,269 --> 00:53:34,769
he's the one who married you,

971
00:53:34,804 --> 00:53:37,605
put your name on every
bill, on every paper.

972
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,191
You have his kids, this fancy penthouse,

973
00:53:40,226 --> 00:53:41,559
his bank accounts.

974
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,894
Take it all, "T."

975
00:53:42,896 --> 00:53:44,062
Divorce his ass

976
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:45,780
and take every last bit of it.

977
00:53:46,866 --> 00:53:48,700
She ain't white, is she?

978
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:50,785
'Cause I could see a brother
like Ghost going that way.

979
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,954
No, she ain't white.

980
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:56,825
Ain't black, either.

981
00:53:56,876 --> 00:53:58,576
Nothing like me at all.

982
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:01,329
Sorry you're going through this, "T."

983
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,882
But you got to take care of yourself.

984
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:06,634
Ghost took back his loyalty.

985
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:08,386
So now it's time for you to do the same.

986
00:54:19,348 --> 00:54:22,100
All hail the goddamn conquering hero.

987
00:54:22,102 --> 00:54:23,601
The redhead lives here now?

988
00:54:23,603 --> 00:54:24,769
Don't worry about her.

989
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,772
She's out cold.

990
00:54:27,823 --> 00:54:32,193
So can we scratch our friend
off the Christmas list?

991
00:54:41,837 --> 00:54:44,005
You did what needed to be done, G.

992
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:51,045
I'm going home, man.

993
00:54:55,634 --> 00:54:58,303
It's a good day's work, brother.

994
00:54:58,354 --> 00:54:59,804
Yeah.

995
00:55:18,157 --> 00:55:19,374
How long have you been here?

996
00:55:19,408 --> 00:55:21,326
I was supposed to go home.

997
00:55:21,328 --> 00:55:23,878
The truth is, my place doesn't
feel much like home anymore.

998
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:28,466
Sorry I stood you up.

999
00:55:31,303 --> 00:55:32,387
How was Stern's?

1000
00:55:32,421 --> 00:55:33,922
I should've taken you.

1001
00:55:35,758 --> 00:55:37,675
Don't say that.

1002
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:40,845
We're not dating.

1003
00:55:40,847 --> 00:55:42,981
We're not a couple.

1004
00:55:43,015 --> 00:55:47,936
We're just two stupid kids playing house,

1005
00:55:47,987 --> 00:55:50,822
trying to wrap our hands around a fantasy.

1006
00:55:51,857 --> 00:55:52,857
I missed one night, Angie.

1007
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:54,943
You miss every night.

1008
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:02,367
I need you to hear me.

1009
00:56:05,871 --> 00:56:08,039
I want to change my life for you.

1010
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:11,342
I don't want to break up your marriage.

1011
00:56:11,377 --> 00:56:15,046
That's not the person
I ever thought I would be.

1012
00:56:15,048 --> 00:56:18,132
So this is on you now, Jamie.

1013
00:56:18,184 --> 00:56:23,021
If you are telling me
that this, us, is gonna happen,

1014
00:56:23,055 --> 00:56:24,439
then it has to happen,

1015
00:56:24,473 --> 00:56:26,357
because I don't know what I'm gonna do

1016
00:56:26,392 --> 00:56:28,393
if you don't come through.

1017
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:34,899
I'll make it happen.

1018
00:56:38,454 --> 00:56:40,071
Just say you love me.

1019
00:56:40,073 --> 00:56:41,823
Jamie.

1020
00:56:41,874 --> 00:56:43,208
Say it.

1021
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,332
I love you, okay?

1022
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,524
Rolla's dead.

1023
00:57:18,944 --> 00:57:20,411
Ghost, you dumb motherfucker.

1024
00:57:20,446 --> 00:57:21,829
Anybody know he did it?

1025
00:57:21,864 --> 00:57:25,083
Not yet.

1026
00:57:25,117 --> 00:57:27,252
Well, we know two things.

1027
00:57:27,286 --> 00:57:29,287
One, Ghost trusts me.

1028
00:57:29,289 --> 00:57:31,456
And two, he's all alone now,

1029
00:57:31,507 --> 00:57:33,791
just got Tommy.

1030
00:57:33,793 --> 00:57:35,877
And that boy way too dumb
to see what's coming.

1031
00:57:35,928 --> 00:57:37,295
It's so much better that you fucked up,

1032
00:57:37,346 --> 00:57:39,013
and Ruiz lived.

1033
00:57:39,048 --> 00:57:40,381
He gonna come looking for protection

1034
00:57:40,432 --> 00:57:41,799
when I come calling.

1035
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:42,967
You owe me money.

1036
00:57:43,018 --> 00:57:44,185
100K.

1037
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:45,970
And you owe me bodies.

1038
00:57:46,021 --> 00:57:47,972
But I'm gonna give you
another chance to get it done.

1039
00:57:48,023 --> 00:57:50,308
I'll pay full freight.

1040
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,670
Oh, and, honey, you're gonna
need to get you some new shoes.

1041
00:57:54,363 --> 00:57:57,815
Look.

1042
00:57:57,817 --> 00:57:58,983
You make sure my son ain't there

1043
00:57:59,034 --> 00:58:00,451
when you do it, neither, right?

1044
00:58:00,486 --> 00:58:02,403
Right.

1045
00:58:02,454 --> 00:58:04,372
- When?
- I'll give you the signal.

1046
00:58:04,406 --> 00:58:06,324
I want Ghost dead before I get out.

1047
00:58:06,326 --> 00:58:08,326
Mm.

(Lardo) So what?
That always happens.

874
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:54,451
So, we're all outta
high school, now.

875
00:53:54,521 --> 00:53:59,112
And some of us are gonna
go to college, get jobs,

876
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:02,313
and start
doing adult stuff.

877
00:54:03,262 --> 00:54:05,052
Yeah, and shit that we hate.

878
00:54:05,132 --> 00:54:07,393
Well look, all I'm
saying is, you know;

879
00:54:07,461 --> 00:54:10,263
things are gonna
be different, now.

880
00:54:12,673 --> 00:54:15,763
Man! I hate this shit.

881
00:54:16,844 --> 00:54:21,544
Start talking about the future;
getting all high and serious.

882
00:54:24,714 --> 00:54:25,974
Shit.

883
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:28,246
I don't know what I'm
gonna do in an hour!

884
00:54:28,325 --> 00:54:29,685
Yeah, and that's really fucked.

885
00:54:29,755 --> 00:54:32,385
What are you saying,
Anne? A lot of people,

886
00:54:32,455 --> 00:54:36,126
they stay in Ventura -
keep partying, surfing.

887
00:54:36,195 --> 00:54:39,327
People like who? Harry, who,
ya know, gets kids to steal

888
00:54:39,397 --> 00:54:41,956
beer for him? I mean, great
fucking role models, JD.

889
00:54:42,037 --> 00:54:43,837
Well you think we should
buy into this shit?

890
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:45,928
That we should start
working and wearing pants?

891
00:54:46,006 --> 00:54:48,378
Is that it? Huh?
Buying insurance?

892
00:54:48,448 --> 00:54:50,777
Get a vacuum cleaner and shit?

893
00:54:51,848 --> 00:54:53,039
Yeah?

894
00:54:54,247 --> 00:54:56,479
You really think that this
is all there is to life?

895
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,989
Maybe.

896
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:05,859
If I thought that, I would
so fucking kill myself.

897
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,420
(Mooney) You don't
have to, you know.

898
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:15,130
You don't have to
buy a vacuum cleaner.

899
00:55:16,871 --> 00:55:19,541
What choice do you have, Mooney?

900
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:23,752
We need more beer.

901
00:55:23,812 --> 00:55:24,581
(Lardo) I'll go,

902
00:55:24,651 --> 00:55:26,282
(Anne) Me too.

904
00:55:27,752 --> 00:55:28,412
Will you help me, Lardo?

905
00:55:28,493 --> 00:55:29,322
Yeah.

906
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,594
Those guys were acting
like such guys, tonight.

907
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:37,134
Yeah.

some time to kick in, ya know?

911

Careful, dude.

912
00:55:57,416 --> 00:55:59,916
Just thinking about Iris.

913
00:55:59,987 --> 00:56:03,728
Ann's goin'to college.
Probably meet some guy.

914
00:56:03,797 --> 00:56:06,887
Iris is moving to New York.

915
00:56:11,808 --> 00:56:14,738
How do you guys
do that, anyways?

916
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:15,899
Do what?

917
00:56:15,979 --> 00:56:18,238
Do chicks and all, man?

918
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:23,720
Easy. You just put your
hand here, inside their leg,

919
00:56:23,779 --> 00:56:26,149
and then you
just slide it up.

920
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,660
Slide it up.
It works every time, man.

921
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,950
Feels pretty good.

922
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,321
Not your own leg, man.
The chick's.

923
00:56:44,742 --> 00:56:49,512
Well, iris's apple wine
works pretty good, too.

924
00:56:56,523 --> 00:56:58,783
It's just like drivin' a car.

925
00:57:00,655 --> 00:57:02,684
What would you do if
you were gonna go on a

926
00:57:02,764 --> 00:57:05,254
long road trip with Lumbie?

927
00:57:09,605 --> 00:57:15,266
Get in, start her
up, and take off!

928
00:57:17,075 --> 00:57:19,737
God, no.
Listen.

929
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:24,246
Ya gotta...ya gotta
sweet talk her a little.

930
00:57:25,456 --> 00:57:29,288
Give her a little
loving, nurturing.

931
00:57:29,357 --> 00:57:33,487
You baby her a little.
You check her um, you

932
00:57:33,558 --> 00:57:37,587
check her fluids, make sure
there's enough lubrication.

933
00:57:38,769 --> 00:57:42,229
You kick the tires, make
sure your rubber's good.

934
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:46,128
And if you feel
confident, and ready,

935
00:57:47,311 --> 00:57:49,840
you slide in the driver's seat.

936
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:53,151
You tickle the starter
and you turn her over.

937
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,782
Then you slip it into drive

938
00:57:56,851 --> 00:58:01,722
and you gently start
to push her forward.

939
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:05,561
And then you're on your way.

940
00:58:06,262 --> 00:58:08,792
But that's when you have
to, you have to listen to her,

941
00:58:08,873 --> 00:58:11,732
really start to pay attention.

942
00:58:13,303 --> 00:58:17,504
And as she starts to warm up,
her temperature starts to rise,

943
00:58:17,573 --> 00:58:21,513
that's when, you know, you
can pump her a little harder,

944
00:58:22,454 --> 00:58:23,973
you know?

945
00:58:24,054 --> 00:58:25,344
And she'll let ya
know when she's ready.

946
00:58:25,425 --> 00:58:27,414
She'll start to hum.

947
00:58:27,485 --> 00:58:30,545
When she starts to hum you go
pedal to the medal, as hard as

948
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:34,616
you can for as long as you can.
That's, that's when it's good.

949
00:58:34,696 --> 00:58:38,355
That's when it gets, you know,
that's like you're a machine on

950
00:58:38,436 --> 00:58:42,996
an open back road somewhere in
America with nothing but like a

951
00:58:43,075 --> 00:58:46,767
forest or corn field on either
side of you with stars in the

952
00:58:46,847 --> 00:58:52,437
sky, and no traffic lights.
There's no coppers, no worries.

953
00:58:52,517 --> 00:58:56,008
That's just, that's
as good as it gets.

954
00:58:56,919 --> 00:59:00,359
That's-
that's being a man;

955
00:59:00,428 --> 00:59:03,060
that's heaven on earth;
that's what that is.

956
00:59:10,939 --> 00:59:14,311
What does all that have
to do with getting women?

957
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:25,781

it for a long time, uh, Sparky.

a whipping for yourself.

counts. You got two left.

1030

three swings.
He already took one.

1031

the other two.

Three swings; one guy.

01:15:14,318 --> 01:15:17,588
Hey, I'm really sorry that
prick stole your board, dude.

1218
01:15:17,657 --> 01:15:19,318
It's not your fault.

1219
01:15:19,388 --> 01:15:21,619
I know that.

1220
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:24,188
Later, gator.
Nice work.

1221
01:15:26,268 --> 01:15:28,459
Hey. Later, Darling.

1222
01:15:28,529 --> 01:15:30,130
Tell your mom I love her stew.

1223
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,570
Tell your mom I
love her daughter.

1224
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,830
You're such a liar.

1225
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:36,570
What? I'm so totally
committed to you.

1226
01:15:39,181 --> 01:15:41,311
Yeah, you're
committed to something,

1227
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:43,111
but it ain't me, babe.

1228
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:45,280
What's that supposed to mean?

1229
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:50,383
When you figure it out, call me.

1230
01:15:55,433 --> 01:15:56,762
♪♪

1231
01:15:56,832 --> 01:15:59,864
Hey Lardo, what do
think it all means, man?

1232
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:02,033
What?

1233
01:16:02,574 --> 01:16:04,594
The whole thing, dude. I mean,

1234
01:16:04,674 --> 01:16:08,634
this guy gets dumped; he
steals my board, he doesn't even

1235
01:16:08,715 --> 01:16:12,675
know me, and Del just happens
to be there, and it's like

1236
01:16:12,754 --> 01:16:15,685
we get this name and because
of that we go to the Valley?

1237
01:16:15,754 --> 01:16:18,775
(Richard) Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no,
we're building over in Ventura.

1238
01:16:20,696 --> 01:16:23,256
Oh it's wonderful,
four stories.

1239
01:16:25,366 --> 01:16:28,357
(Lardo) Brian Kramer, bro.
He turned out to be not such

1240
01:16:28,437 --> 01:16:33,307
a bad guy - just some dude
who got dumped - by Iris.

1241
01:16:34,537 --> 01:16:37,029
Bro, she took his heart
and she just like ripped

1242
01:16:37,107 --> 01:16:41,638
it up into pieces. She's
fuckin vicious, that girl.

1243
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:49,009
Well, we got your board back.

1244
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,490
<i>(squealing tires)</i>

1245
01:16:54,558 --> 01:16:55,500
Shit!

1246
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,260
Man.

1247
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:58,430
Oh, Shit!

1248
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,800
Ah.

1249
01:17:04,712 --> 01:17:06,571
<i>(Deep sigh)</i>

1250
01:17:06,642 --> 01:17:08,372
(Lardo) It looks okay, dude.

1251
01:17:11,652 --> 01:17:13,382
(JD) It doesn't look too bad.

1252
01:17:13,452 --> 01:17:14,752
(Lardo) Whoa!

1253
01:17:14,823 --> 01:17:16,283
<i>(Crack!)</i>

1254
01:17:16,352 --> 01:17:18,823
(JD) No!!!

1255
01:17:35,605 --> 01:17:38,945
(JD) At that moment,
it hit me.

1256
01:17:39,645 --> 01:17:43,376
It wasn't about a surfboard;
it was about the journey,

1257
01:17:43,456 --> 01:17:45,647
with my friends.

1258
01:17:52,497 --> 01:17:55,468
Lardo and I are still
the best of friends.

1259
01:17:55,528 --> 01:17:58,297
He has a beautiful daughter
now and always makes the best

1260
01:17:58,367 --> 01:18:02,138
of every day - in typical
Lardo fashion, of course.

1261
01:18:03,978 --> 01:18:07,069
Sparky lived every day like
there was no tomorrow.

1262
01:18:07,148 --> 01:18:10,509
He rode his last wave in
at the age of twenty-five.

1263
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:13,779
He was truly one-of-a-kind,
man, and I'll always remember

1264
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:16,379
the crazy shit we
used to do together.

1265
01:18:16,459 --> 01:18:20,321
Nobody did it like Sparky.
Miss ya, bro.

1266
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:25,361
Iris went to New York
and became an artist,

1267
01:18:25,431 --> 01:18:27,491
just like she said she would.

1268
01:18:27,572 --> 01:18:30,832
She's not rich and famous yet,
but she still keeps her edge,

1269
01:18:31,642 --> 01:18:34,732
and visits Ventura
whenever she can.

1270
01:18:38,483 --> 01:18:41,612
Anne found a great guy
willing to commit to her.

1271
01:18:42,924 --> 01:18:45,783
She's married,
has a beautiful boy,

1272
01:18:45,853 --> 01:18:48,794
and I still remain great
friends with her and her family.

1273
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:56,134
My hero Mike Mooney.
He's a family man, now.

1274
01:18:56,205 --> 01:18:59,105
Still the legend on Pierpont,
and hand-shaping surfboards

1275
01:18:59,176 --> 01:19:02,005
in the same garage -
for the love of it.

1276
01:19:20,628 --> 01:19:23,558
<i>(Taps surfboard)</i>

1277
01:19:24,597 --> 01:19:26,229
(Del) Hey.

1278
01:19:33,009 --> 01:19:36,139
(JD) There's been a whole
lotta change in Ventura,

1279
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:38,310
but then again,

1280
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:41,820
lots of things have
stayed the same - like Del.

1281
01:19:48,761 --> 01:19:52,061
And as for me,
I got a beautiful wife,

1282
01:19:52,131 --> 01:19:56,622
four great kids,
play music with my friends,

1283
01:19:56,702 --> 01:19:59,532
and still surfing -

1284
01:19:59,603 --> 01:20:01,803
in Ventura.

1
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:24,850
I don't think so.

2
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:41,692
Exactly.

3
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,267
Okay, I love you.

4
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,724
Well, hello handsome.

5
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:13,560
And since I just moved
here a couple of years ago,

6
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:16,735
I don't know too many folks,
It sure is nice to...

7
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:19,934
Have someone to share a Thanksgiving meal with.

8
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,876
I just love to cook.

9
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:24,310
Well whatever pulls your hair back
honey, you're paying.

10
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,041
So, what are you a doctor?

11
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,416
Because there's some fancy ass
medical books you got there.

12
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,149
No, I ...

13
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,152
I just work at Buffalo Regional.

14
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,423
Well ...

15
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:39,950
Why don't we play doctors and nurses when I
get back from the little girl's room?

16
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,654
Okay. Yeah.

17
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,766
It's down the hall on the end.

18
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,671
Are you ready for me, baby?

19
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,706
Don't be shy now.

20
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,218
This is so disappointing.

21
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:49,562
When were you going tell me, you have ...

22
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:59,700
I take you off the streets

23
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:05,433
and offer you the chance to create something,
rather than destroy it!

24
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:11,350
- And this is how you pay me in return?
- Please, I'll do anything you want!

25
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:15,386
No, no!

26
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:25,088
A committed relationship is
between a man and a woman.

27
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,633
How did you think this was ever
going to work out?

28
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:30,728
What are you talking about?

29
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:33,696
Come on ...

30
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,742
It's okay. I'm doing you a favor.

31
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:49,115
Do everyone a favor.

32
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:55,323
<i>We're returning to the crime in a case that has puzzled
Buffalo law enforcement for the past 3 years.</i>

33
00:04:55,496 --> 00:05:00,028
<i>Authorities this afternoon announced the closing down
of a once high profile investigation.</i>

34
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,861
<i>Which begun with the disappearance of
17 year old prostitute Lisa Donnelly.</i>

35
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,275
<i>Donnelly was the first of seven sex workers</i>

36
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:12,169
<i>to go missing from downtown Buffalo
over a three year period.</i>

37
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,705
<i>With all the alleged abductions taking place during
the winter months of November through March.</i>

38
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:20,279
<i>A nurse at Buffalo Regional hospital, Darrell Kennedy</i>

39
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:23,282
<i>was initially named by authorities
as a person of interest,</i>

40
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,689
<i>but was eventually cleared of all involvement.</i>

41
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,584
<i>While officials claim budget restraints
are forcing the allocation</i>

42
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:33,028
<i>of resources to other cases,
sources close to the investigation</i>

43
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,302
<i>blame the failure of detectives
to locate a body</i>

44
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,676
It's bullshit cut and run politics Kelsey.

45
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,946
They're thinking shut this guy down
with a press conference.

46
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:55,249
Take a look out there.

47
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,514
Seven out of seven were taken in the snow.
Seven out of Seven.

48
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,090
-  Are you listening to me, or what?
- I'm not deaf, Mike.

49
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,227
You think these guys would be
shutting it down if it was their daughter?

50
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:05,764
I don't fucking think so.

51
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,765
- What, you're not going to fight this?
- Hey!

52
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,501
I was the dumbass who fought
to be on this case, remember?

53
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,934
What a great move that turned out to be.

54
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,773
Come on, it's Thanksgiving
for Christ's sake!

55
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,780
Be thankful.
Let it go for one night.

56
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:26,785
Hang with family, eat too much,
pass out on the couch, easy stuff.

57
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,688
What are you, my nanny?
My life coach?

58
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,318
There's alot you don't
know about me, detective.

59
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,290
Don't even think about it.

60
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,297
Abby would never forgive you
if you didn't come in.

61
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,933
We've got a ton of paperwork
to get done.

62
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:42,094
The sooner we get it done,
the sooner we can move on from this.

63
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:43,727
Will you listen to yourself?

64
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:46,737
You're obsessed.
You've got to let it go.

65
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,539
Come in for a drink.

66
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,174
Come on.
One drink going to kill you?

67
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:53,012
There really is no point in even having
this discussion

68
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,809
because dinner is about
to be on the table.

69
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,779
So if you could just come and help me,
that would be great.

70
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,887
Mom, please.
Tad's whole family invited me over.

71
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:01,821
You're going to have to tell Tad's whole family

72
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:04,287
that you're spending Thanksgiving
with your own family.

73
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,484
Hey, surprise, surprise!

74
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:06,815
Hey!

75
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:10,057
This is a surprise.
Mike didn't tell me you were able to make it.

76
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,291
Who cares?
Finally somebody cool.

77
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,935
I'm not staying, I just wanted to come in
and say happy Thanksgiving.

78
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,571
Come on, relax.
There's plenty to go around, right Shelley?

79
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,374
Yes, you could have my plate,
because I'm having dinner at Tad's family.

80
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,036
You know what?
Enough, young lady, OK?

81
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:24,940
You're staying in, that's it. Final.

82
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,536
Even your dad managed to make the effort.

83
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,774
This is unbelievable.
Do you see what i have to deal with?

84
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,205
This is so fucked.

85
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,848
Now you're just showing off.
Could you go tell your brother to come?

86
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,054
- Could you?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,317
Make mine a large.

88
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,159
- Hey, sorry.
- No, don't worry about it.

89
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,092
You should see me at that age.

90
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:49,492
God, Dad.

91
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,261
I'm not hungry.

92
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:57,440
She's been cooking all day Abby,
don't be stupid.

93
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,769
It's like being under house arrest to live here.

94
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:02,573
Yeah, must be rough.

95
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:05,841
You haven't even been here
to see what a Nazi she's become.

96
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,087
Abby.

97
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:08,980
It's Thanksgiving.

98
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:11,284
Want to help me out here?

99
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,927
Come to dinner.

100
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,392
Look, why don't we go to White Face this weekend
make the most of the early snow?

101
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,262
You like the cabin, don't you?
It's fun. Remember last year?

102
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,874
Missed all that school because the...
the big dump?

103
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:30,944
Dad, no.

104
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:33,545
Look, I'll be out in a minute, okay?

105
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,245
Get your head together, please.

106
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:40,020
Don't be rude.

107
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:41,845
Come on.

108
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:52,063
You'd think with a scholarship to Cornell
wouldn't be a no-brainer, but no.

109
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,266
Now she's talking about going to
Buffalo State to be closer to Tad.

110
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,804
I don't know. First love.

111
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,372
I guess you got to let them get it
out of their system, right?

112
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:02,833
Wow, look at you guys.

113
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:04,837
When was this?
Have I seen this?

114
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:08,743
Yeah, it was a while ago ...

115
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,977
Look who we got here. Say hi to Kelsey.
He can't say "strawberry".

116
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:15,852
Wait a minute, you're not Jed!
You're too tall to be Jed.

117
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,981
I'm gonna put bricks on your head
to make you short again.

118
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,727
Last chance, Kelsie.
Want to stay for a drink ...

119
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,293
Michael, could you let the poor
girl go home already?

120
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:26,128
She's probably sick and tired of you.
Don't worry about it, Kelsie.

121
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,459
Here, I'll take that.

122
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,733
- Tell Abby I said goodbye.
- Yeah.

123
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:31,772
Jed, did you say goodbye?

124
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:32,739
- Bye!
- Have you said goodbye to Kelsie?

125
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:35,000
- Did you look her in the eye buddy?
- A Happy Thanksgiving!

126
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,234
Good job.

127
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,405
- Jed, you washed your hands?
- Yes.

128
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,437
This looks great.

129
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:45,783
You sure you can handle a family dinner
without your backup?

130
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,816
Come on, It's Thanksgiving.

131
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,455
She didn't have anybody in Buffalo.

132
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,782
She's supposed to be our friend, you know?

133
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,015
If she were a real friend you wouldn't force her
to work the same ridiculous hours as you.

134
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,693
That way she might actually have someone
to spend Thanksgiving with.

135
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,825
I mean, it's not sad enough she's a 30 year old woman
who can't have kids ...

136
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,992
You want to deprive her social life too?

137
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:06,172
I didn't forced her to do anything.
Kelsie is a big girl, she can look after herself.

138
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:09,936
Let me do that.
Don't tell your mom, just take a sip.

139
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,808
- Let me get that, please?
- Okay.

140
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,842
This looks great.

141
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:21,851
Look at this amazing job your mom did.

142
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,321
Allright, doesn't this look great?

143
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,018
Here, boy.

144
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,723
Jesus, Dad.
Is this cold enough in here for you?

145
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,227
It helps to keep me awake.

146
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:45,963
What's up kid?

147
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,536
Mom, would like you to come inside
so you can see Jed's costume

148
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,769
for his stupid thing.

149
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:54,813
Tell her I'll be in, In a minute.

150
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,009
He's playing a donkey and i was like,
Jed really need a costume for that?

151
00:11:58,886 --> 00:11:59,853
Come on now ...

152
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,261
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

153
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,728
Why do you spend so much time here?

154
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:17,736
What is it with these girls?

155
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,333
Well, they got names.

156
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,808
This is Lisa Donnelly.
She grew up in Riverside.

157
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,238
She started working the streets when
she was younger than you.

158
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,214
She's been missing for two years.

159
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,816
She was gone three months
before anybody reported her gone.

160
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,081
And when they did, it wasn't her
mother or father or ...

161
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,824
... or brother, or sister.
It was her landlord looking for back rent.

162
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,953
So much for the city of good neighbors, huh?

163
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,959
All these girls ... It's all the same.

164
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:50,993
I never found a single body.

165
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,800
Now they're just missing girl,
that nobody missed.

166
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,136
That would be a horrible way to live, right?

167
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,152
Come here.

168
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,491
Leave me alone, I'll be in, In 10 minutes.

169
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:03,638
Happy Thanksgiving.

170
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:37,606
Okay, so here's what I don't understand.

171
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:40,245
If Divine was working at a
Girls Girls, Girls last night,

172
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,813
What was she doing curb crawling?

173
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,879
Come on man, she's not stupid.

174
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,785
She hasn't worked the streets since
they all started to go missing.

175
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:51,455
She was on her break,
getting money at the ATM for the drugs.

176
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,423
For the drugs, what kind of drugs?

177
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:54,816
HRT.

178
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,062
- What's HRT?
- Hormone Replacement Therapy.

179
00:14:58,866 --> 00:14:59,855
She's a tranny?

180
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,367
She's a pre-op transsexual, allright?

181
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:07,703
She was going to take the next couple
of days off to rest up, you know?

182
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,244
Fuck! There were three days
away from surgery.

183
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,147
We are going to do our very best to find her
and we're going to call you as soon as we hear anything.

184
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:20,847
Okay?

185
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:31,526
We should be working on this thing
nonstop since I moved up here.

186
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,530
When people said you were reaching even
calling it a case I had your back, right?

187
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,461
But if we'd to go in from the D.A.
tomorrow, what do we really have?

188
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,533
Your intuition?

189
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,169
No bodies, no homicide, Mike.

190
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:48,411
God, I want this as bad as you do but there's dogged
and then there's just plain pig-headed

191
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:51,350
- Come on, she's a missing hooker.
- Who's been missing less than 12 hours.

192
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:54,884
She's probably in a bar somewhere about
to give some John the surprise of his life.

193
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:57,857
She was about to get that chopped,
you heard the boyfriend, right?

194
00:15:57,892 --> 00:15:59,783
She was supposed to be at home,
In bed, resting.

195
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,725
What the fuck?
Are you with me on this or what?

196
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,057
Of course I'm with you.

197
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:05,694
I'm just saying what about the other
seven hookers who were all girls?

198
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,697
Biological girls.
Why would he change his M.O now?

199
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,204
You saw her pictures, she had me fooled.

200
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,169
Look, assume for a minute that I'm right.
Which you really should.

201
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,738
This fuck comes out of his cave
for the first time in ten months.

202
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,545
And he gets a chick with a dick.

203
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,307
You really think he's going back
into hibernation just yet?

204
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:28,245
This is it.

205
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,819
Girls, Girls, Girls.

206
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,059
I guess Divine had them all fooled too.

207
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,862
Hey Steve, It's Mike.
Need you to do me a favor.

208
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,263
Hey, this came through just now.

209
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:48,874
So there's Divine at the ATM.

210
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,971
Pick up perp might drive
a late 90's dark sedan?

211
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,904
Bring in Crystal, will you?

212
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,847
I want to find out what she saw last night.

213
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:15,766
Jesus.

214
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:18,896
D, you don't look so good.

215
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,263
No shit.

216
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:23,099
It started, checking inventories
every week.

217
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,836
Whole joint is locked up like a
motherfucking Fort Knox.

218
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,078
Amazing what we can do
when we have to.

219
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,752
Carl man you are not listening.

220
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,481
The hospital called security
on the supply room.

221
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,457
I can't get shit now without there being
a link straight back to me.

222
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,723
<i>Hey Darryl, do you want anything
special for Christmas?</i>

223
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,753
<i>You know what I want.</i>

224
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:45,757
What the fuck is that?

225
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,733
You told me you're going
to get rid of that shit.

226
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,358
I guess I forgot.

227
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,201
I'll just skip to the money shot,
you know It's ...

228
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,973
I was amazed at the quality.
I mean ...

229
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:01,604
This is just a regular video phone but ...

230
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:06,780
Oh yeah, you can ... make out all the details.

231
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,812
<i>It's not every day you get to
tap a hooker for free, right?</i>

232
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,459
Why the fuck are you doing this?

233
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,894
I'm just trying to protect the partnership.

234
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:23,129
Come on Carl, man ...

235
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:24,899
We're not really partners, right?

236
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,603
I've never asked what you going to do
with all the shit I gave you.

237
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,803
That's your own personal shit
and I respect that.

238
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:38,145
Man look, you got me over
a barrel here, allright?

239
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,452
And you know that I ain't ever,
never going to talk about ...

240
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,677
... our little business here.

241
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,988
- But you got to understand, man ...
- I understand, man.

242
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:49,059
I understand that you raped a patient.

243
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:55,628
You got her pregnant and you asked me
to take care of it, which I did.

244
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,464
They give you the big needle
for that up here.

245
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:07,309
So, what I'm asking you ...
compared to what you asked of me?

246
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,113
Just think about it.

247
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,384
You stop own when I stop asking.

248
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,115
There are a couple more things that
I forgot to mention.

249
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:21,751
I'm going to need you ...

250
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,652
To pick those up too.

251
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,023
I'll come to you, just like the last time.

252
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,131
And D ...

253
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,734
Stop taking those pills, man.

254
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,764
You're going to give yourself
a heart attack.

255
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,535
Fuck you, buddy!
I heard that.

256
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,447
Hi, honey.

257
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,219
- Hey, Crystal.
- Hey.

258
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:51,889
How's it going?

259
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:55,456
Got down to 12 degrees last night.
How do you think It's going?

260
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:57,727
- You have a nice Thanksgiving?
- Yeah, it was great.

261
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,957
So much for showing this fucking
thing down, huh?

262
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,529
Yeah, can I get your list of plates
from last nght?

263
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,693
Yeah.

264
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,667
Every sorry son of a bitch to pass
from 6 untill 2 in the morning.

265
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,174
We're looking for a dark sedan.

266
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:11,967
We think our guy might be
back on the scene.

267
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,372
Spread the word out to the girls.

268
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,513
- They are already talking about it.
- Yeah?

269
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:16,874
It's fucked up.

270
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:19,616
Divine was a nice kid.

271
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,613
I'm gonna run these.

272
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:34,024
Okay, so ...
The first lucky guy of the night.

273
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,307
You want me to take this round?

274
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,303
Sure. I'll get the next.

275
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,979
Sweetie, would you go get your sister?
Tell her to come set the table.

276
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:24,948
Please tell me you're on your way home.

277
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:28,215
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just caught up in here.

278
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,522
- Mom said you got to set the table.
- I'm on the phone!

279
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:39,094
Okay so, just come over when
you're done, Okay?

280
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,860
Why are you such a dick Tad?
Please!

281
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,305
Fine.

282
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:50,801
Mom's going to be angry!

283
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:53,775
<i>She's out of control.
She won't let up about seeing tad tonight.</i>

284
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,814
On weekends, remember?
On weekends, during the day?

285
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,950
Oh my God, like It's that easy Mike,
your child's in heat.

286
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,351
Can you talk to her?

287
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,320
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
That's disgusting!

288
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,083
Come on Abby, come back here!

289
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,093
Jesus, did you hear it?
Could you talk to her, please?

290
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,621
Look, Shell, I'm just in the middle of this ...

291
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,526
I'm gonna to talk to her when I get back,
and just straighten it out, Okay?

292
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,533
Okay, your dinner is in the microwave.

293
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,665
Jesus Christ, that kid can fight.

294
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,303
I wonder where she gets that from.

295
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:29,575
Get ready to be happy.

296
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,653
So I run Crystal's plates through DMV
to cross check for dark sedans.

297
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:35,479
We came up with a couple dozen matches.

298
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:38,916
Just on a spec I run it through ViCAP
and sex offenders database.

299
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,823
How's this for a real charmer?

300
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:44,224
'97 arrested for holding a hooker at knife point,
that's two years.

301
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:48,659
2001 sentenced to ten for kidnap and stat rape.
Again, a hooker.

302
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:52,203
Paroled three years ago after
being repeatedly beaten inside.

303
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:55,135
And this is you closing the case down
how exactly?

304
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:58,766
Drive was the right car, he was in the area,
and he's been out since we lost the first girl.

305
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,803
With the snow and all the holiday weekend

306
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:03,342
only the most desperate
girls were on the streets.

307
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,742
Without witnesses.
That's his M.O.

308
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,349
The guy is a snow hunter.

309
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,449
It's the most we ever had.

310
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,219
And he's obviously got a thing for hookers.

311
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,059
Come on, throw us a bone.

312
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,667
<i>last pool of the days kids.</i>

313
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:26,702
Abby?

314
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,235
Okay, I'm gonna do the dishes.

315
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:35,441
If this music is still playing when i get back,
you're not seeing anyone this weekend, Okay?

316
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,778
Fine.

317
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:00,899
Would you like a refill?

318
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:02,541
Yeah.

319
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,003
Is that regular or diet?

320
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,302
What do you think?

321
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,040
- Your parents are going to freak.
- Tad, they'll never going to know.

322
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,905
I really needed to be with you.

323
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,476
Where you been, Carl?
You supposed to be at work.

324
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,220
What the fuck happened to your head?

325
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,815
You ought to get that shit looked at.

326
00:24:54,361 --> 00:24:55,385
It's all here?

327
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:56,818
Yes.

328
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:07,269
I'll hang out here untill you close up and then
you can sneak back into my place, Okay?

329
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:09,002
You're not listening to me right now.

330
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,507
This isn't working Ab.

331
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:16,504
I'm sorry, I just think we got to take a break,
you know until we get a little longer.

332
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:22,149
- What?
- I think you're amazing.

333
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,484
And I love spending time with
you when we can but ...

334
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:27,918
I'm about to finish college.

335
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:29,822
You haven't even finished high school.

336
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:31,428
And the way your parents act ...

337
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:32,958
I can never forget that.

338
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,759
If you can't see past that then I guess
you're just as fucked up as they are, aren't you?

339
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,298
- Abby.
- Fuck you!

340
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,508
This is the last time, Carl.

341
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:55,388
Fuck this.

342
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,137
Hey there.

343
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,245
- A slow night?
- Fuck you asshole.

344
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:32,825
Are you new in town?
I haven't seen around.

345
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:36,953
You got a lighter I can use?

346
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:38,722
Yeah, sure.

347
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,531
Gee, you must be freezing out there.

348
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,528
- Good to roll Detective.
- Let's do it.

349
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:00,135
<i>Blue team secure the perimeter.</i>

350
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,904
<i>Give me visual ID on the vehicle.</i>

351
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,822
<i>Looks like a dark blue Lincoln sedan.</i>

352
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:11,722
<i>Repeat, dark blue Sedan.</i>

353
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,321
<i>We're in Detective.</i>

354
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:34,840
Secure downstairs, go, go!

355
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,289
<i>Where you at Green? Over.</i>

356
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,248
<i>Accessing the basement.</i>

357
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,769
<i>What you got down there Green?
Talk to me.</i>

358
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,001
Go, go!

359
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:04,100
Buffalo PD. Hands in the air.

360
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,005
Hands up, motherfucker!

361
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:12,373
Mike?
I don't think he can.

362
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:20,087
<i>Basement is clean.
Repeat. Basement is clean.</i>

363
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:21,385
<i>We got nothing down here.</i>

364
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:23,086
You got to be fucking kidding me.

365
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,268
<i>I'm sorry I'm calling so
late and for disturbing your son.</i>

366
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:35,172
- No plates. Do you believe this?
- That was his mother.

367
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,941
He's been like that since he got out of prison.
She's the only one who drives this.

368
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,036
I'm telling you, our guy knows how we work.

369
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:44,245
He didn't steal some sick fucking
pervert's license plates by chance.

370
00:29:44,484 --> 00:29:45,849
- The fucker set us up.
- Who is this fucking guy?

371
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:48,486
He has access to DMV records?
What else does he have?

372
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:51,715
Yeah?

373
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,787
Shelley let me call you.
Calm down.

374
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:57,688
She what?

375
00:29:58,598 --> 00:30:01,226
Allright let's try to be rational.
It's only been a few hours.

376
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:04,870
Could you stop acting like a fucking cop
and act like a father for one second?

377
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:06,699
Shelley listen, you guys had a fight.

378
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:08,940
She's probably at a girlfriend's house.

379
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,805
I'm sorry do you have kids?
What do you know?

380
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,006
I'll go get some tea.

381
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:20,209
Look, It's probably just a matter of a
couple of phone calls. Allright?

382
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:21,979
Help me out here.
Who did you call?

383
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:24,685
Come on, did you call the kid?
Did you call Tad?

384
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,019
Yeah, of course I called Tad.
He's at work, he hasn't seen her.

385
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,486
No one has seen her.

386
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:30,425
Look, It's Mike's daughter for God's sake!

387
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:34,558
I don't know.

388
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,361
Yeah well she's not just any
other girl, allright?

389
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,571
Look, just do what you have to do.

390
00:30:44,077 --> 00:30:46,011
she goes out on weekends.
Of course she does.

391
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,443
- She didn't go to bars on her own.
- Of course she does.

392
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:50,115
She goes with friends, she goes with Tad.

393
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:53,450
- Did you call Sarah?
- I called Sarah, I called Rachel, I called rachel's mom.

394
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:54,980
What about that kid Evan
she used to hang out?

395
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:58,023
She hasn't seen her for years.
Her number is not even in the book.

396
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,449
I just phoned it through to Steve

397
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:06,525
Just in case, they'll need to know what she
was wearing before they can put out an APB.

398
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:19,335
Drink some of this.

399
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:54,845
This here ring is a symbol of
our commitment to each other.

400
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:56,772
'Til death do us part.

401
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:06,920
Come on, It's okay.

402
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,194
I got one just like it. See?

403
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,318
We all do.

404
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:15,701
Come on, It's picture time.

405
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,298
Welcome home.

406
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:18,524
We're checking her email,
her phone logs, her facebook page.

407
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:20,856
NCIC and the hospitals are all online.

408
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:24,096
I've requested CCTV footage from
all of the bus and train depots.

409
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:25,599
And our friends across the lake?

410
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:27,938
No, there's no record of her
crossing the border.

411
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:30,706
Allright. Notify Rochester and Detroit.

412
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,209
Run everything back through me.

413
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:36,210
- Kelsey, you wanna give us a sec?
- Yeah.

414
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:46,850
If you need anything ...

415
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:49,986
You got to take a couple of days off,
to be with the family.

416
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:53,787
That's why I spend 18 years on the force
to let somebody else find my own kid?

417
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,066
This gets messy and I'm not
going to have any choice.

418
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:01,362
Do you understand?

419
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:02,704
Sure.

420
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,784
Excuse me, sir.
You got a visitor.

421
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:20,983
Where is she?

422
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:22,986
Where did you get this one Tad?

423
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:29,892
Abby was at the diner last night.

424
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:34,196
You lied to my wife about seeing her?

425
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,341
We had a fight.
I didn't know what else to do.

426
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,601
Allright she snuck out,
I just didn't want her to get in trouble.

427
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,813
- Tell me what happened.
- I didn't do anything.

428
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:44,044
Allright look, we got into an argument
then she run out.

429
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:46,613
- She left her jacket and phone, that's it.
- Where did she go?

430
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,653
On to the street.
I should have followed her outside.

431
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:49,687
- You didn't go after her?
- No!

432
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:51,519
- Was she alone? Or she was with someone?
- No.

433
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,251
Who was she with?

434
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,391
Who was she with?

435
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:58,126
- She was talking to somebody outside.
- Who was she talking to?

436
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,494
She was talking to somebody
outside in a car.

437
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,733
You let my daughter get into a car
in the middle of the night?

438
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,227
- It happened too fast, I couldn't see.
- What did the car look like Tad?

439
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:08,005
- Come on!
- It was a dark sedan!

440
00:35:15,748 --> 00:35:17,375
I'm telling you the truth,
I swear to God.

441
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,183
I didn't ask her to sneak out.

442
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,447
And when Mrs. Fletcher kept calling,
I panicked.

443
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:23,880
Okay, I didn't know what to do.

444
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,048
That's why I'm here now.

445
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,657
He was there.

446
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:37,802
This guy.

447
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:39,969
He was at the diner last night.

448
00:35:57,757 --> 00:35:58,883
So ...

449
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,053
Sleeping Beauty awakes.

450
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:05,688
Jesus.

451
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:07,761
You're the replacement?

452
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,031
What, you're like 12?

453
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,564
I'm 17.

454
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,907
Oh my God, you're a baby.

455
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,898
He's going to love you long time.

456
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,573
What is this?
Where are we?

457
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:21,240
How long have you been down here?

458
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,044
34 and a half cycles.

459
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:25,841
I'm sorry.

460
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:29,580
There's plenty of time to be sorry.

461
00:36:29,822 --> 00:36:31,255
Is it really Thanksgiving?

462
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,825
Who is that?
Who the fuck was that?

463
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:37,288
Oh that? It's just Lauren.

464
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,832
- This is bordering on harassment.
- We haven't even started yet.

465
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,533
I'm sorry, where's the harassment?

466
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:45,700
She's part of an ongoing investigation.
She was under your care for 3 months.

467
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,739
- This is standard procedure.
- This is bullshit.

468
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,771
How many times do I have to explain this?

469
00:36:49,842 --> 00:36:50,740
One more time, come on.

470
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:55,110
I'm a postnatal nurse. Lauren was in physio,
she was never under my care.

471
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,611
I drop in and say hello to her every few days.

472
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:01,678
Hookers don't tend to get a lot of visitors,
that's what nurses do.

473
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:06,048
The night she went missing, I was in surgery
with a dozen witnesses but you know that

474
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:08,392
Because you questioned them all,
already.

475
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:15,024
This whole thing is .... is really sad.

476
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:16,359
But you know what I know.

477
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:20,697
- So, if that's all ...
- Sit the fuck down!

478
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,402
Where were you last night?

479
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,537
I was here, I pulled a double.

480
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:28,747
How come a witness put you in
a diner downtown?

481
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,440
Where another girl was abducted.

482
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,142
That's not possible.
I don't know anything about some other girl.

483
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:36,347
No, no. Not some other girl.
This girl. Look at it.

484
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:38,724
Do you recognize her?

485
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,727
Look, I told you I don't know what
the fuck you talking about.

486
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:42,691
- Bullshit.
- Mike!

487
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:45,492
I know you were there,
You fat fuck.

488
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,087
Look!

489
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:52,264
Check it out with his boss.

490
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:54,564
Check it out with his boss.

491
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:06,550
I'm at the end of a very long
shift detective so ...

492
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,687
Both of you were at that diner last night.

493
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,389
I know about Lauren Daniels and the
seven other girls, allright?

494
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,288
I don't know what you talking about.
What seven other girls?

495
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:17,258
I think you know about my Goddamn daughter, do you?

496
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:19,287
I think you know where my girl is!

497
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,458
I swear to God!

498
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,759
I swear to God, I don't know anything
about your daughter!

499
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:25,926
That's it, we're done.

500
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:34,746
Maybe Tad made a mistake!

501
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:36,577
Scrubs, he said scrubs.

502
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:40,779
How many 300 pound black nurses
you think we have in this fucking town?

503
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:44,680
You saw the roster which means there's
still nothing to connect Abby to the case.

504
00:38:44,924 --> 00:38:46,687
That's a good thing,
he only targets hookers.

505
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:48,723
- Read the description.
- Mike.

506
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:50,623
Kelsey, read it.

507
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:52,689
What does it say?

508
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:58,498
"17 year old, single white female"

509
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,929
"Last seen on the corner of Fillmore and Ferry."

510
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:05,778
"Short black skirt, low-cut top.
Heavy makeup."

511
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:07,211
What does that sound like to you?

512
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:13,211
It didn't take long.

513
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:21,689
Hey, chief.

514
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:23,924
God. Hi, Daddy.

515
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:28,426
Please take me down.
It really hurts me.

516
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,080
Pill patrol.

517
00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:13,705
How much longer she got now daddy?

518
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,575
- Eight weeks, three days.
- She's doing good, huh?

519
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:22,878
Better than you.

520
00:40:23,222 --> 00:40:25,690
I'm trying daddy, you know I'm committed.

521
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:27,589
It's only a matter of time.

522
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,220
That's how you keep saying.

523
00:40:35,668 --> 00:40:36,692
Maybe you're broke.

524
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,571
It's the well for you next time.

525
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:50,410
How's our new addition?

526
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:52,078
You settling in allright?

527
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:53,777
What does it matter?

528
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,782
I'm not going to be here for long.

529
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:57,982
My dad's a cop.

530
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:02,660
Up there, maybe.
Not down here.

531
00:41:03,362 --> 00:41:04,351
Are you sure?

532
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,832
Because he knows all about you,
you sick fuck.

533
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:10,294
I don't think so.

534
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,331
I think I'm going to be just fine.

535
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:20,540
I think we're all going to be just fine.

536
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,896
A couple of weeks off
might be a good thing.

537
00:43:15,294 --> 00:43:16,591
Daddy, what's wrong?

538
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:19,021
Go inside.

539
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:22,093
- But, Daddy ...
- I won't tell you again. Go inside.

540
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,183
There are some rules that
we have in this family.

541
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:43,822
You'll get to know them.
They are relatively simple.

542
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:47,688
But for now, It really is just a matter
of good old fashioned give and take.

543
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:53,055
You eat what I give you.
You don't touch anything.

544
00:43:56,902 --> 00:43:58,335
Unless I tell you to.

545
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:00,262
And everybody does their part.

546
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:05,799
Ain't that right, Brittany?

547
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:11,739
I got a good feeling about this one daddy.

548
00:44:13,252 --> 00:44:14,219
What do you think?

549
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:17,388
Hey.

550
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:19,713
I'm talking to you.

551
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:21,618
What do you think?

552
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,728
Do you think we're going
to get lucky this time?

553
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:32,695
- Wait... what are you doing?
- Lauren, honey ...

554
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:34,796
Will you do the honors?

555
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:48,282
- Babies are made out of love.
- That's right.

556
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,651
Babies are made out of love.

557
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:31,720
Mommy, if Abby doesn't come back,
does that mean I get her presents?

558
00:46:45,737 --> 00:46:47,898
Helps to get things flowing
in the right direction.

559
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,342
Hey.

560
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,815
You dind't think I forgot, did you?

561
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,132
Happy anniversary, Mommy.

562
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,760
Thank you, Daddy.

563
00:47:36,455 --> 00:47:37,786
You looking for something bigger?

564
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:42,818
Actually I'm waiting on a warrant
for Darryl's appartmen.

565
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:45,824
We're not very popular with the D.A right now.

566
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:47,623
Yeah.

567
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:50,759
I thought I'd get some work done from home.

568
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:55,701
Shelley will probably like that.

569
00:47:56,742 --> 00:47:57,731
I'll call you later.

570
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:02,532
Jesus fucking Christ.
You looking to get shot?

571
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:07,642
I'm backing you up in case some
nosy neighbor calls in a B and E ...

572
00:49:07,813 --> 00:49:09,838
... and find yourself explaining this
to some uniform cop.

573
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:11,749
You seen this?

574
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:15,618
Take a look.

575
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:18,579
That fat piece of shit lives right across
the street from where Abby was taken.

576
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:24,491
<i>Lauren, What did he inject me with?</i>

577
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:25,789
Don't worry.

578
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,490
It's good for you.

579
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,963
Gets you nice and ready.

580
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,901
He gives it to all the girls.

581
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:35,696
How many others have there been?

582
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:37,908
Well there was the first.

583
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:40,040
Daddy talks about her all the time.

584
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:43,173
Then me, Lisa, Brittany ...

585
00:49:44,483 --> 00:49:47,043
Sarah, Amanda ...

586
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,380
Abby.

587
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:51,778
What happened to them?

588
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:54,021
They just weren't good mommies.

589
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,294
That's why she's so scared?

590
00:49:57,362 --> 00:50:00,490
Daddy saved her from some crackhouse ...

591
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:04,633
... gave her all this, and she can't
give him anything In return?

592
00:50:04,903 --> 00:50:06,302
This is number two for me.

593
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:09,338
And Brittany has been given
a lot of chances, but ...

594
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,508
... sound like daddy has lost
patience with her.

595
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,568
How long have you been here?

596
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:16,406
Just had our 3 year anniversary.

597
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:19,078
How did you guys meet?

598
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:20,784
It was like fate, Abby.

599
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:24,817
This John hit me in his car
and smashed up my legs pretty good.

600
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:28,784
I went up In this hospital,
where I met this nurse, Darryl.

601
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:33,628
I think he had a crush on me because
he was always dropping In to say hello.

602
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:37,829
This one day, just before Christmas ...

603
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,466
... one of the doctors comes in,
looking all serious ...

604
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:45,003
And tells me ... I'm pregnant.

605
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:47,838
I went to sleep that night ...

606
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:49,841
and when I woke up ...

607
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:52,176
I was here.

608
00:50:54,686 --> 00:50:56,677
See, daddy saved me.

609
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,657
From what?

610
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:01,853
From breaking a family silly.

611
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:06,691
Daddy says there are whores who
are disgusting and break up families

612
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:10,432
So he takes us off the streets so we can
build a family rather than destroy them.

613
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:14,472
Lauren.

614
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:18,406
What happened to the babies?

615
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:24,714
We are not meant to talk about it.

616
00:51:26,718 --> 00:51:28,845
I'm sure he'll show you
if you're good.

617
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:33,278
It won't be too long now.
I'm sure you'll have one too.

618
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,518
<i>Turn off the light.</i>

619
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:38,818
<i>Get out of here, leave me alone.</i>

620
00:51:39,998 --> 00:51:42,489
"Pass the salt"?
I can't remember what it was.

621
00:51:43,902 --> 00:51:46,902
I might never see Abby again and the
last thing I said was "turn off the fucking light"?

622
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:49,600
Are you kidding me?

623
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:53,835
You need to go home, get some sleep.
You've been up for two days straight.

624
00:51:54,813 --> 00:51:56,144
I can't sleep, Kelsey.

625
00:51:57,082 --> 00:51:58,049
What would you do?

626
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:00,544
What we've seen.

627
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:04,218
That's Abby now.

628
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:07,281
You're wrong Mike.

629
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:12,425
She's not like the girls
we've been looking for.

630
00:52:13,665 --> 00:52:14,689
She's not.

631
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:18,595
She's not like the girl that went missing
from my home town when I was young.

632
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:21,794
Because ...

633
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:27,605
Went out one day and never came back,
like she vanished into thin air.

634
00:52:28,947 --> 00:52:30,141
Do you know why?

635
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:33,580
Because that girl didn't have anyone
to put up posters.

636
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:38,714
Or knock on doors or stay out all night
trolling the streets.

637
00:52:40,225 --> 00:52:43,490
Once that girl went missing it was like
she never existed in the first place

638
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:45,291
and that is not Abby.

639
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:49,059
She's got you.

640
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:52,934
And Shelley and me.

641
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:54,796
She's got family.

642
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,036
So wherever she is, she's not alone.

643
00:53:01,413 --> 00:53:02,573
I promise you that.

644
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,347
Get some sleep.

645
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,782
I'll call you in the morning.

646
00:53:41,286 --> 00:53:44,619
<i>Thank you for calling Stenlakes of Buffalo.
Please leave a message.</i>

647
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:47,517
It's detective Mike Fletcher,
Buffalo P.D.

648
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,616
Need to ask you some questions
about a Darryl Kennedy.

649
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:40,936
He said he wants a ...

650
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:45,341
Wii from Santa.

651
00:54:45,984 --> 00:54:46,973
You know what this is?

652
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:49,050
It's already under the tree.

653
00:54:50,188 --> 00:54:51,788
Good.

654
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:58,124
It's true what they say
about the first 48 hours, right?

655
00:55:08,907 --> 00:55:11,940
But Shelley, Kelsey's out there.
Everybody's doing everything they can.

656
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:15,544
But they're not her father.

657
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:23,143
I'm going to bring her home, I promise.

658
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:33,054
Come on buddy, you can't park here.

659
00:56:35,293 --> 00:56:36,282
Come on, let's go.

660
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:42,697
Mike Fletcher.

661
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:47,796
Why don't you grab a coffee?
I'll let her know you're here.

662
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:57,772
Hey.

663
00:56:58,449 --> 00:56:59,746
Have some strong coffee?

664
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:04,554
Yeah, sure.

665
00:57:12,697 --> 00:57:15,131
You know a fella who works here,
named Darryl Kennedy?

666
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,862
You mean in the kitchen?

667
00:57:19,037 --> 00:57:21,497
No, no. I don't know. A big guy?

668
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:23,567
Assistant nurse.

669
00:57:26,577 --> 00:57:30,206
You're talking about Big D.
Yeah, I mean, I know Big D.

670
00:57:31,082 --> 00:57:34,651
A guys his size is going to spend a little time with
his nose in the troph, you know what I mean?

671
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:36,844
You know him well?

672
00:57:37,322 --> 00:57:41,520
No. I know that he likes my southern fried chicken.

673
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:45,456
That's about it.
Hell, he likes pretty much anything I put in front of him.

674
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:54,300
I'm not bleeding, Am I?
My boss is going to kill me, I'm sorry.

675
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,500
I banged the shit out of myself,
this morning.

676
00:57:58,576 --> 00:58:00,771
Coming out from under the hood of my car.

677
00:58:02,547 --> 00:58:05,545
Thank God I'm a better chef than I am a mechanic,
you know what I mean?

678
00:58:14,092 --> 00:58:16,583
I apologize for my behavior yesterday.

679
00:58:18,363 --> 00:58:19,955
I just lost control.
I was way out of line.

680
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:23,059
I just need to ask you
a few questions about Darryl.

681
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,294
I can't help you with Darryl, I'm afraid.

682
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:28,398
After what happened, I sent him home.

683
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,701
And he didn't show up for work this morning.
No phone calls, nothing.

684
00:58:32,844 --> 00:58:33,936
That's not like him.

685
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,445
I'll make sure to tell him
you dropped by.

686
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:39,746
No, please, just ...
What would he want ...

687
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:42,447
... with any of these?

688
00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:48,985
Did you write this?

689
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:51,589
Me? No.

690
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:54,588
Well I can guarantee you
it wasn't written by Darryl

691
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:56,989
Or anybody else on my stuff
for that matter.

692
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,267
How can you do that?

693
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,502
Accurate notation is
paramount to patient care.

694
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,467
Spelling is all wrong
and It's medically inaccurate.

695
00:59:07,478 --> 00:59:08,502
What's all this stuff for?

696
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:11,381
Nutritional supplements,
for malnourishment.

697
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:13,145
Heparin, is an anticoagulant.

698
00:59:13,451 --> 00:59:16,079
It's for thrombosis,
for patients with immobility.

699
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:18,787
F.S.H. Is a fertility drug.

700
00:59:19,524 --> 00:59:21,924
- It's injectable.
- I don't understand.

701
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,091
All this shit's been missing from the hospital
for the best part of three years, right?

702
00:59:25,363 --> 00:59:27,024
The exact same time frame as our case.

703
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:32,169
Most of this stuff, prolongs life.

704
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:36,335
Maybe that's why we never found a body

705
00:59:38,843 --> 00:59:40,504
Do you think Darryl's holding these girls?

706
00:59:41,546 --> 00:59:42,808
Darryl didn't write this shit.

707
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:45,147
This is somebody else's handwritting.

708
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,347
I think there's somebody else.

709
00:59:47,652 --> 00:59:49,017
Maybe he's with somebody else.

710
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:52,480
What do you think?

711
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:54,256
You want to know what I think?

712
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,293
I think you need to go home.

713
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:00,253
I think you need to stay your family.

714
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:02,231
I think you need to get your fucking
head straight, that's what I think.

715
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,224
- Oh , Come on!
- Come on what? You had this for 12 hours Mike.

716
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:08,931
You had this last night
and you sat on it?

717
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:11,368
You didn't think to tell me about it?

718
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:13,800
How the fuck does that
helping me find Abby?

719
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:16,939
That's not us Mike.

720
01:00:17,849 --> 01:00:18,873
That's not who we are.

721
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,217
Look, Mike.

722
01:00:31,231 --> 01:00:34,155
I have heard you ... and I'm on it.

723
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,093
Get some sleep.

724
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:40,526
Trust me you'll find Abby.

725
01:00:49,147 --> 01:00:50,205
Hello?

726
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:53,674
Listen, It's only a matter of time.
We just got to be smart, right?

727
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:55,752
See, my dad is looking for us.

728
01:00:56,454 --> 01:00:59,651
- He's looking for all of us right now.
- No one is looking for us silly.

729
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:02,454
He is. I swear to God,
This is his case.

730
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,494
I've seen your pictures on his wall.

731
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:08,320
I know.
He never stopped looking for you.

732
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:10,729
Okay? I swear to God.

733
01:01:10,902 --> 01:01:14,736
- And my family will not give up ...
- Shut up! This is your family now.

734
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,166
No, no.

735
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:19,339
Please, this is ...

736
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:21,369
This is not a family.

737
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,908
You can't say that.

738
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:25,771
Too late.

739
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:27,439
Wait.

740
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:30,218
We are in this together ...

741
01:01:30,588 --> 01:01:31,577
right?

742
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:33,283
Right?

743
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:34,982
Wrong.

744
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:37,385
Wait!

745
01:01:49,574 --> 01:01:52,566
She was telling secrets daddy.
Talking about leaving us.

746
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:54,711
Said her dad is going to look
for us and find us.

747
01:01:54,946 --> 01:01:57,506
But we don't want him to,
because we belong here with you.

748
01:01:58,482 --> 01:01:59,608
Is that right?

749
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:02,579
It's true daddy.

750
01:02:05,423 --> 01:02:06,617
Thank you ladies.

751
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:16,958
Now you're going to see how
things happen around here.

752
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:20,769
Again.

753
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:23,930
- God!
- You'll learn, honey.

754
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:26,006
You will learn that this ...

755
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:32,315
This is a sign of trust ...

756
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:35,046
Of loyalty, of commitment.

757
01:02:35,653 --> 01:02:38,144
Because without commitment,
we're nowhere.

758
01:02:39,457 --> 01:02:41,857
You are sick!

759
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:46,154
I guess we're going to have to explain it again.

760
01:02:53,738 --> 01:02:56,172
So I hear from one of my girls,
same night Abby went missing

761
01:02:59,377 --> 01:03:00,776
Some guy tries to drag her into his car.

762
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:02,601
A dark sedan.

763
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:04,110
She cracks a bottle over his head, you know?

764
01:03:04,582 --> 01:03:05,606
Hits him pretty good.

765
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:06,941
And gets the fuck out of there.

766
01:03:07,818 --> 01:03:09,012
I don't even know her.

767
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,048
She works out of this apartment here.

768
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:14,914
Girls get beat up every night of the weekend here
so it could easily be nothing.

769
01:03:15,693 --> 01:03:17,388
I just thought even though is nothing,
maybe it's something.

770
01:03:20,765 --> 01:03:22,096
Your loss, buddy.

771
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:56,326
I'm looking for Emma.

772
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:00,370
250.

773
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,166
Three doors, down on the left.

774
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:28,092
Make yourself at home.

775
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:37,304
Is this your first time?

776
01:04:39,777 --> 01:04:40,835
Yeah.

777
01:04:41,078 --> 01:04:42,636
Yeah, you'll be fine.

778
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:55,050
Must hurt.

779
01:04:57,862 --> 01:04:59,295
Yeah, you should have seen the other guy.

780
01:05:00,164 --> 01:05:01,222
Yeah?

781
01:05:02,933 --> 01:05:05,333
- You got in a fight? Someone hit you?
- Oh, yeah.

782
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:07,701
It was really scary.

783
01:05:08,606 --> 01:05:10,733
I wish you would have been there
because you would have ...

784
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:14,837
You would have hurt him for me, right?

785
01:05:16,447 --> 01:05:17,709
I would have fucking killed him.

786
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:24,179
Who's this guy?
What did he look like, the guy who hit you?

787
01:05:25,656 --> 01:05:27,385
I don't know.
He came at me from behind.

788
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:31,086
So I couldn't ... see his face.
He just kept telling me to shut up.

789
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:33,218
What did he sound like?

790
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:35,956
- I mean, what his voice sound ...
- I don't know.

791
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:39,134
Like he wasn't from around here.

792
01:05:39,437 --> 01:05:40,665
He had an accent maybe?

793
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,796
- What kind of accent did he have?
- What is this, 20 questions?

794
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,799
He sounded like a redneck, Okay?

795
01:05:47,011 --> 01:05:49,809
And he smelled like a fucking
hotdog stand.

796
01:05:49,814 --> 01:05:50,803
Onions and shit.

797
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:52,677
Anything else you want to know?

798
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:54,406
I don't get it.

799
01:05:54,885 --> 01:05:56,147
You want to fuck him or me?

800
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:02,216
Just slow down for a minute.
I just want to get to know you.

801
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:04,853
- I just want to take it easy.
- You want to take it easy?

802
01:06:05,296 --> 01:06:07,161
You know what, time is money mister.

803
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:08,822
Don't do that!

804
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,689
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck.

805
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,977
Nice one, asshole.

806
01:06:24,782 --> 01:06:25,976
I just got he down.

807
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:31,684
Get the fuck out of here before Jerome
throws your ass down the stairs.

808
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:36,792
You've got to commit to him.

809
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:42,765
That's why we're here.
The other girls aren't.

810
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,825
We only did what we had to.

811
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:47,532
And good girls get rewards.

812
01:06:47,905 --> 01:06:51,864
Like once a week, he invites one
of us upstairs for date night.

813
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:55,701
With good food and a nice soft bed.

814
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:59,444
You can sometimes see out the window
and everything.

815
01:06:59,717 --> 01:07:01,048
Don't waste your breath.

816
01:07:02,086 --> 01:07:04,213
At this rate, she won't even last
'till the end of the week.

817
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:05,648
Ain't that right, princess?

818
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:21,994
Why, why, why?

819
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:24,868
- Sure starting to come down now.
- What?

820
01:07:27,444 --> 01:07:28,411
Oh, yeah.

821
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:31,976
Don't look like you go anywhere in a hurry.

822
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:48,624
I'll forgive you.

823
01:07:52,903 --> 01:07:54,131
You're eating with me tonight.

824
01:07:58,409 --> 01:07:59,569
I'm sorry, Daddy.

825
01:08:00,978 --> 01:08:02,377
I didn't mean to mess up.

826
01:08:03,781 --> 01:08:05,749
I promise I'm not going to do it anymore.

827
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:13,717
I'm sorry too.

828
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:16,888
I don't like having to do things like that, It's ...

829
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:19,655
That's not me.

830
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:23,226
You going to eat something finally?

831
01:08:37,748 --> 01:08:40,046
Go on. I trust you.

832
01:08:52,096 --> 01:08:54,564
I just spoke with TSA at Buffalo Niagara.

833
01:08:54,865 --> 01:08:57,698
Delta's got a Darryl Kennedy
booked to fly out on the 9:30

834
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:00,269
But the airpost just cancelled
all flights because of the storm.

835
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:03,272
Call all the units to the terminal
in case the asshole shows up.

836
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:05,304
And put a uniform outside his aparment.

837
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,470
- You find him, I am your first call.
- Got it.

838
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,419
Where are you?

839
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:35,565
While I'm eating fried chicken
and drinking wine ...

840
01:09:35,806 --> 01:09:39,003
I'll probably tell daddy that
you aren't really sorry after all.

841
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:41,544
That you told me you hated him and ...

842
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:43,372
Never wanted to be part of this family.

843
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:44,941
Hey, you can't touch his things.

844
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:49,774
- You're so fucked.
- Please don't do that. He'll kill you.

845
01:09:50,921 --> 01:09:51,945
Nice knowing you.

846
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,454
What the hell is going on?

847
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:02,928
- Brittany! You of all people.
- Daddy, no ...

848
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,725
No daddy, you don't understand!
It's not what you think.

849
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:07,666
- Sure as shit looks like it.
- Please don't do that.

850
01:10:09,907 --> 01:10:12,467
- I'll be better, I promise, Daddy.
- You left me no choice girl.

851
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:13,975
Please don't make me go in there daddy.

852
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:15,040
- Please!
- Go on!

853
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:17,372
- It's so cold.
- Get in the goddamned well.

854
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:19,681
You heard that shit, move your hands.

855
01:10:20,284 --> 01:10:21,751
Oh my God, stop, please!

856
01:10:22,786 --> 01:10:24,378
Please let her go.
You can't do that.

857
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:29,782
Please stop, she's striving.
She's going to die.

858
01:10:31,361 --> 01:10:33,522
Please, she's pregnant!

859
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:36,123
That's why she hit the buzzer,
she wanted to tell you

860
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,528
And she put on the music
and she was happy, I promise.

861
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:40,904
- How did she know?
- We just know these things!

862
01:10:40,905 --> 01:10:43,372
Please, daddy, please,
she's going to die!

863
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:46,703
Lauren. No secrets.

864
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:51,711
It's true daddy.

865
01:10:57,855 --> 01:10:59,482
Hurry, is she breathing?

866
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:01,783
Is she okay?

867
01:11:01,784 --> 01:11:04,785
Yes, she's going to be okay.
Up you go girl.

868
01:11:04,786 --> 01:11:07,561
She just swallowed a bunch of water.
Didn't you darling?

869
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:10,695
She's going to sleep it off.
She'll be right as rain.

870
01:11:11,096 --> 01:11:12,896
You just get some sleep now momma.

871
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:15,364
That's it, good girl.

872
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:21,702
I'll be goddamned.

873
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:24,176
Looks like she came through after all.

874
01:11:25,249 --> 01:11:26,580
I can hardly believe it.

875
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:28,683
Guess that means you're up honey.

876
01:11:30,187 --> 01:11:31,347
I'll pick you up at 8.

877
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:33,914
That's for when she wakes up.

878
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:37,250
You never can be too sure about this things.

879
01:11:44,201 --> 01:11:45,361
What am I missing Kelsey?

880
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,369
It's staring me right in the face.
What am I not seeing?

881
01:11:58,282 --> 01:11:59,249
What about her?

882
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:01,842
Did she get a good look at him?
Maybe she can make him on a lineup?

883
01:12:01,919 --> 01:12:02,749
The Kid? No, no, no.

884
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:05,083
She was close enough to
hit him in the head with a bottle

885
01:12:05,184 --> 01:12:07,584
but she couldn't make his face.
I guess that's something, huh?

886
01:12:08,559 --> 01:12:10,823
Yeah, good for her. I hope it hurt.

887
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,291
Do you think It's our guy?

888
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,867
He's got to be.

889
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:21,603
The same night, 30 minutes from
where Abby was taken, 4 blocks away.

890
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:22,865
It's got to be him, right?

891
01:12:24,942 --> 01:12:26,034
Detective Walker.

892
01:12:28,145 --> 01:12:29,806
Sorry sergeant, slow down, I can't ...

893
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:33,072
You're breaking up.
Let me call you back.

894
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:35,811
What? What, what?

895
01:12:37,988 --> 01:12:39,046
Okay, go.

896
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:40,581
Hotel Bourbon.

897
01:12:40,891 --> 01:12:43,451
Suite 233.
And they definitely confirmed that it's him?

898
01:12:43,861 --> 01:12:45,692
- What?
- We'll be there in 20.

899
01:12:45,896 --> 01:12:48,330
- What goddamnit, what?
- They just called a bunch of airport hotels.

900
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:51,866
They found us a 300 pound black guy
who just checked in, paying all cash.

901
01:12:52,803 --> 01:12:53,701
We got him.

902
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:00,002
You want to slow down a little?
He's not going anywhere.

903
01:13:16,126 --> 01:13:17,388
Fuck!

904
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,080
I'll get the front.

905
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,801
Hello! Hello!
The hell is everyone?

906
01:14:10,614 --> 01:14:13,208
Darryl open up, It's detective Walker!
We have a warrant.

907
01:14:18,588 --> 01:14:19,680
We're coming In.

908
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:32,031
- Get up asshole, get up!
- Darryl?

909
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:33,701
Christ.

910
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:36,569
- No pulse.
- Fuck!

911
01:14:37,908 --> 01:14:38,806
It demerol.

912
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:43,640
- Darryl?
- We need an ambulance.

913
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,213
Bourbon hotel, second floor.

914
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:48,207
Don't you fucking die Darryl.

915
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:57,323
Mike, get on the phone.

916
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:01,721
Mike?

917
01:15:31,828 --> 01:15:34,126
I'm so sorry I'm late, honey.

918
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:42,866
I'll be damned.

919
01:15:43,774 --> 01:15:46,800
You sure do scrub up nice.
You might be the prettiest one yet.

920
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:54,280
She's sleepig pretty
soundly now daddy but ...

921
01:15:54,581 --> 01:15:56,181
she came to a while ago.

922
01:16:16,773 --> 01:16:18,866
Let's see if we can get you one too.

923
01:16:36,326 --> 01:16:37,293
Allright.

924
01:16:38,028 --> 01:16:38,995
You ready?

925
01:16:51,541 --> 01:16:52,769
It's like we're in a date.

926
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:55,711
I want to make our first time real special.

927
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,938
I'm not sure if I'm all that special.

928
01:16:59,349 --> 01:17:00,748
I hope you like Cajun chicken.

929
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:05,183
- It's one of my specialties.
- I love anything southern.

930
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:10,919
Let's have a look, shall we?

931
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:18,564
<i>You know, a lot of folks will tell you
there's only one way to season a bird</i>

932
01:17:18,702 --> 01:17:21,865
<i>but I say the hell with that.
I throw a lot of spices at it.</i>

933
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,935
<i>Cooking for me, it's
like life, you know?</i>

934
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:31,241
<i>Just got to do what feels natural.</i>

935
01:17:31,748 --> 01:17:32,840
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

936
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:40,854
Are you going to get
drunk tonight daddy?

937
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:42,280
Damn.

938
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:44,684
We got a wild one on our hands, don't we?

939
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:51,698
You want to see this.

940
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:56,767
Forensics is here,
they're going to move everything.

941
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:03,301
Well wherever he's going, he's not going
to leave without some trophies.

942
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,108
It's all here, body parts.

943
01:18:06,917 --> 01:18:10,216
Yeah, there's a scrapbook
with credit cards and photos.

944
01:18:12,289 --> 01:18:13,449
He's not doing so good.

945
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:19,695
- Mike Fletcher.
- Hi Detective Fletcher

946
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:21,856
<i>This is Chelsea from Stenlakes
returning your call.</i>

947
01:18:21,932 --> 01:18:23,559
- Sorry?
- Stenlakes of Buffalo.

948
01:18:23,767 --> 01:18:25,701
You left a message regarding
a Darryl Kennedy?

949
01:18:25,769 --> 01:18:26,736
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

950
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:30,528
So we checked our books and unfortunately
we got no record of a Darryl Kennedy.

951
01:18:30,841 --> 01:18:33,832
- Neither as a client or employee.
- I understand.

952
01:18:34,177 --> 01:18:36,168
Sorry It's taken us a little
while to get back to you ...

953
01:18:36,246 --> 01:18:38,771
as you can imagine we get
pretty slammed over Thanksgiving.

954
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:42,483
- Excuse me?
- All catering companies do.

955
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,186
It's our busiest time of the year.

956
01:18:44,988 --> 01:18:47,115
- You are a catering company?
- Yeah, commercial catering.

957
01:18:47,324 --> 01:18:50,418
- Offices, industrials ...
- Wait a second, you do hospitals?

958
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,227
Sure, we've got our guys over it.

959
01:18:52,462 --> 01:18:55,431
Sheehan Memorial
Mercy Hospital, Buffalo Regional.

960
01:18:55,865 --> 01:18:58,026
I got you little motherfucker, I got you.

961
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:08,773
I'm sorry sir,
I'm going to have to call you right back.

962
01:19:09,846 --> 01:19:11,609
- What's going on, Mike?
- I saw him.

963
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:13,109
I spoke with him goddamnit.

964
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:15,750
I saw the cut on his head
when she hit him with the bottle.

965
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:17,409
He's southern, just like she said.

966
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:19,684
She even said that he smelled food.

967
01:19:20,824 --> 01:19:22,519
These drugs weren't for Darryl.

968
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:25,052
You are not making any sense.
What the hell are you talking about?

969
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:27,059
Looking for him.

970
01:19:27,731 --> 01:19:28,857
Looking for him.

971
01:19:29,733 --> 01:19:31,633
Carl Anthony Gemeaux.

972
01:19:33,637 --> 01:19:34,899
I got this motherfucker.

973
01:19:41,478 --> 01:19:42,911
What am I supposed
to tell the chief Mike?

974
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:44,378
Anything you want.

975
01:20:00,497 --> 01:20:01,486
May I?

976
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:03,921
Sure darling.

977
01:20:05,869 --> 01:20:06,927
To Family.

978
01:20:16,246 --> 01:20:17,406
Hold that thought.

979
01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:26,889
Hello?

980
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,218
Chief, we're on our way to his house now.

981
01:21:02,425 --> 01:21:03,722
Carl Anthony Gemeaux.

982
01:21:04,828 --> 01:21:06,022
We're not sure what his connection is.

983
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:08,720
Maybe he's using Darryl to get
hospital meds, I don't know.

984
01:21:10,934 --> 01:21:12,231
Yes he's with me.

985
01:21:26,983 --> 01:21:28,746
You ungrateful little bitch.

986
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:38,918
Motherfucker!

987
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:17,924
Mike!

988
01:23:27,737 --> 01:23:29,466
It's too early.

989
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:32,469
I'm not ready.

990
01:24:51,688 --> 01:24:52,746
It's okay.

991
01:24:56,559 --> 01:24:57,821
You're going to be fine, allright?

992
01:24:58,027 --> 01:24:58,994
You're going to be fine.

993
01:24:59,462 --> 01:25:01,863
- You just have to push, Okay?
- I can't.

994
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:04,628
I got no muscle control
down there since the accident.

995
01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:07,297
You have to cut it out.

996
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:10,733
Just like the last one.

997
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,381
Hello?
Hello, anybody there?

998
01:26:33,256 --> 01:26:35,087
Hello, is anybody down there?
Who's down there? Hello?

999
01:26:36,092 --> 01:26:37,389
Hello?

1000
01:26:38,628 --> 01:26:39,652
Hello?

1001
01:26:40,763 --> 01:26:41,752
Dad?

1002
01:26:42,298 --> 01:26:43,560
Daddy is that you?

1003
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:45,629
Abby? Abby.

1004
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:48,666
Oh God, daddy,
I knew you would come.

1005
01:26:49,372 --> 01:26:50,930
Daddy, oh my God.

1006
01:26:53,108 --> 01:26:55,566
Dad listen,
the key is around his neck, Okay?

1007
01:26:56,813 --> 01:26:59,509
Daddy, did you hear me?
The key is around his neck.

1008
01:27:00,016 --> 01:27:02,814
Please you have to hurry,
there's two other girls down here ...

1009
01:27:02,815 --> 01:27:05,279
and they really need a hospital,
please daddy hurry.

1010
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:07,889
No, no, no, Abby,
It's okay, I'm here.

1011
01:27:08,858 --> 01:27:09,984
I'm going to come get you out.

1012
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:11,853
<i>Just wait for a minute.</i>

1013
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:13,722
<i>I'm going to get the key
and I'm going to come right back.</i>

1014
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:14,760
Kelsey is going to stay with you.

1015
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,693
Anybody else goes down
the stairs with me, kill him.

1016
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:50,990
Oh my God, I can't do this!

1017
01:29:37,907 --> 01:29:38,703
Mike?

1018
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:48,874
Are you okay?

1019
01:30:03,065 --> 01:30:04,293
Hey, hey.

1020
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:07,157
Look at me.

1021
01:30:16,212 --> 01:30:17,372
You are not going to make it.

1022
01:30:23,019 --> 01:30:23,986
Mike.

1023
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:31,827
Jesus Kelsey.

1024
01:30:52,014 --> 01:30:53,811
We would have
taken good care of Abby.

1025
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:55,674
We would have treated her
like one of our own.

1026
01:30:56,452 --> 01:30:59,012
But instead you went and you did this
and you left me no choice.

1027
01:30:59,622 --> 01:31:00,816
What am I missing Kelsey?

1028
01:31:00,923 --> 01:31:03,255
It's staring me right in the face.
What am I not seeing?

1029
01:31:03,726 --> 01:31:05,318
It's Mike's daughter for God's sake.

1030
01:31:05,494 --> 01:31:07,257
I just thought she was another girl.

1031
01:31:07,363 --> 01:31:08,955
Well she's not just
any other girl, allright?

1032
01:31:09,065 --> 01:31:10,760
<i>Should we just go ahead as usual?</i>

1033
01:31:11,767 --> 01:31:12,859
Just do what you have to do.

1034
01:31:13,069 --> 01:31:15,765
We're on our way to his house now,
Carl Anthony Gemeaux.

1035
01:31:16,005 --> 01:31:18,701
It's not sad enough she's a 30 year old woman
who can't have kids

1036
01:31:18,774 --> 01:31:20,639
You want to deprive her social life too?

1037
01:31:20,743 --> 01:31:22,301
Can I get your list of plates from last night?

1038
01:31:22,378 --> 01:31:24,369
I want you to be happy.
Who is this fucking guy?

1039
01:31:24,447 --> 01:31:26,847
He has access to DMV records,
what else does he have?

1040
01:31:26,849 --> 01:31:29,409
I was the dumbass who fought
to be on this case, remember?

1041
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:31,612
- Maybe he's with someone else.
- You're breaking up, let me call you back.

1042
01:31:31,787 --> 01:31:33,550
You find him, I am your first call.

1043
01:31:33,622 --> 01:31:36,386
She's not like the girl that went missing
from my hometown when I was young.

1044
01:31:37,226 --> 01:31:39,660
Went out one day and never came back.

1045
01:31:39,862 --> 01:31:41,853
Like she vanished into thin air.

1046
01:31:43,599 --> 01:31:44,623
Come here, baby.

1047
01:31:49,372 --> 01:31:50,532
There she is.

1048
01:31:52,008 --> 01:31:53,066
There she is.

1049
01:31:54,944 --> 01:31:55,968
The first.

1050
01:32:10,157 --> 01:32:11,252
Need a lift?

1051
01:32:12,461 --> 01:32:13,325
Where are you headed?

1052
01:32:14,096 --> 01:32:15,154
Anywhere.

1053
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:17,723
Come on.

1054
01:32:36,986 --> 01:32:39,250
I just wish I could
have given you one myself.

1055
01:32:39,989 --> 01:32:41,081
Even just one.

1056
01:32:42,691 --> 01:32:43,715
Me too.

1057
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:47,619
You did your part, huh?

1058
01:32:49,165 --> 01:32:50,530
You made us feel safe.

1059
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:53,928
You made us feel protected.

1060
01:32:55,204 --> 01:32:56,796
That's what families do.

1061
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:00,369
You be strong darling.

1062
01:33:00,843 --> 01:33:03,812
You are going to be a great,
great mommy.

1063
01:33:08,818 --> 01:33:09,807
Daddy.

1064
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:30,798
You should be real proud, Mike.

1065
01:33:31,807 --> 01:33:33,536
You did everything
you could to save Abby.

1066
01:33:36,812 --> 01:33:38,712
But I have kids of my own to think of now.

1067
01:34:03,772 --> 01:34:05,000
I found it in Abby's room.

1068
01:34:07,343 --> 01:34:08,810
She's starting a family too.

1069
01:34:13,782 --> 01:34:15,215
You can't hurt her anymore, can you?

1070
01:34:17,253 --> 01:34:18,277
Can you?

1071
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:32,724
Kelsey.

1072
01:34:34,737 --> 01:34:35,795
You're just like the other girls.

1073
01:34:39,642 --> 01:34:40,768
Kelsey, you're a victim.

1074
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:46,943
He doesn't love you anymore.

1075
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:50,041
I was lost before daddy found me.

1076
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:51,413
I'm not a victim.

1077
01:34:53,789 --> 01:34:54,915
I am a mother.

1078
01:34:56,325 --> 01:34:57,257
Kelsey.

1079
01:35:17,546 --> 01:35:18,570
Kelsey?

1080
01:35:19,215 --> 01:35:20,876
God, Kelsey.

1081
01:35:22,218 --> 01:35:23,651
Kelsey, where's Dad?

1082
01:35:25,421 --> 01:35:26,649
It's okay.

1083
01:35:29,325 --> 01:35:32,260
- Kelsey, where is Dad?
- It's okay, It's over, It's okay.

1084
01:35:32,528 --> 01:35:34,826
- Kelsey, where is my dad?
- Freeze, don't fucking move.

1085
01:35:34,897 --> 01:35:37,695
- Drop the weapon.
- It's Okay, I'm Buffalo PD, I called it in.

1086
01:35:38,934 --> 01:35:40,128
Get a medic down here.

1087
01:35:43,639 --> 01:35:46,369
<i>We have a possible cardiac arrhythmia,
you need a defibrillator.</i>

1088
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:05,654
What the hell is this?

1089
01:36:07,096 --> 01:36:08,461
It's a baby factory.

1090
01:36:09,732 --> 01:36:11,029
Where are the babies?

1091
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:14,399
Allright, look up for me.

1092
01:36:15,037 --> 01:36:18,495
Down, left, straight forward.

1093
01:36:20,009 --> 01:36:24,006
Until the guys from trauma get here,
if you need anything just let me know, okay?

1094
01:36:24,847 --> 01:36:26,781
Jimmy, lets get another blanket back here.

1095
01:37:31,046 --> 01:37:33,139
<i>You called the Fletchers.
Please leave us a message.</i>

1096
01:37:36,185 --> 01:37:37,152
<i>Hey It's me.</i>

1097
01:37:37,886 --> 01:37:40,878
<i>I wanted to call and apologize
for not being there at the funeral.</i>

1098
01:37:41,457 --> 01:37:43,925
<i>I just ... I couldn't.</i>

1099
01:37:45,494 --> 01:37:46,859
<i>Mike was my partner.</i>

1100
01:37:48,097 --> 01:37:50,156
<i>My responsibility.
He was also ...</i>

1101
01:37:51,367 --> 01:37:53,562
<i>My friend.
And I'm just so sorry ...</i>

1102
01:37:54,903 --> 01:37:55,699
<i>Abby ...</i>

1103
01:37:57,806 --> 01:37:59,671
<i>Your dad knew you were pregnant.</i>

1104
01:38:00,442 --> 01:38:02,342
<i>Honestly, he was so excited ...</i>

1105
01:38:03,212 --> 01:38:05,203
I know you're probably
scared to death right now.

1106
01:38:07,249 --> 01:38:08,682
But you are going to be a mom.

1107
01:38:09,885 --> 01:38:12,149
And it will bring you more joy
than you could ever imagine.

1108
01:38:15,858 --> 01:38:16,984
I love you guys.

1109
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:38,838
Hi everybody.

1110
01:38:40,382 --> 01:38:41,815
Welcome home.

1111
01:38:42,785 --> 01:38:44,377
Welcome home everybody.

1112
01:38:51,527 --> 01:38:56,328
Mrs Hamilton, you're here!
Welcome to our little patch of paradise.

1113
01:38:56,665 --> 01:38:59,964
- We made it, finally.
- God.

1114
01:39:00,536 --> 01:39:02,527
She's adorable.

1115
01:39:03,739 --> 01:39:05,673
You are going to love it here,
I can tell.

1116
01:39:05,808 --> 01:39:10,040
Good schools, quiet neighborhood,
just a great place for a young family.

1117
01:39:10,212 --> 01:39:12,510
That's sounds exactly like
what we've been looking for.

1118
01:39:12,581 --> 01:39:14,208
Well then come on in for Pete's sake.

1119
01:39:14,283 --> 01:39:16,547
Let me show you what we've been
talking about all this time.

1120
01:39:16,852 --> 01:39:17,841
Where do you want to start?

1121
01:39:18,787 --> 01:39:20,550
Why don't we start with the nursery?

1122
01:39:20,823 --> 01:39:21,812
Okay!

1123
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,717
- I'll be In, In just a second.
- Allright.

1124
01:39:42,878 --> 01:39:44,140
<i>But you are going to be a mom.</i>

1125
01:39:45,214 --> 01:39:47,682
<i>And that will bring you more joy
than you could ever imagine.</i>

1126
01:39:48,884 --> 01:39:49,680
<i>I love you guys.</i>

1127
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:56,216
<i>I love you guys.</i>

1
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:32,989
Alright, I had planned on taking
a walk around the garden

2
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,458
and showing you the lake.

3
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:38,310
Really Clive, I don't expect
you to control the weather.

4
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:43,213
- Still, we can make much of it.
- Indeed.

5
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:49,593
Let's just see
what's been prepared.

6
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,600
- Lemonade.
- Marvelous.

7
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:55,680
- Glass?
- Please.

8
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,606
You really are
quite beautiful, June.

9
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:17,949
And you really are
quite a charmer, Clive.

10
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:28,797
The lemons were freshly squeezed
this morning by by my staff.

11
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:30,050
- Really?
- Yes.

12
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:34,417
- Excuse me, Mr. Willis?
- Yes, Jack?

13
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:36,624
Can I get some of
your lemonade, please?

14
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:39,648
No, you certainly may not.

15
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:43,254
It's become improper, Jack.
Back to your chores.

16
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:47,739
Smart even,
I never knew this quite.

17
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,805
More.

18
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:59,066
Is it also improper for me to stick
my cock in your good lady's mouth?

19
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:04,296
- Jack, have you gone mad?
- Yeah.

20
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:11,425
One sip, one sip, one sip.

21
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:16,694
- One sip of lemonade is all I wanted.
- Jack!  No!

22
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:18,695
Lemon fucking-ade.

23
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:26,701
<i>Could've been fine.</i>

24
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:28,735
<i>Stupid fucking bitch.</i>

25
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,432
Oh, they should have
given him a lemonade, man.

26
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:33,849
Yeah, you noticed they go
the fucking madman with an axe.

27
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:36,450
Oh, wait and see
what he does with the bodies.

28
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:37,989
So fucked up.

29
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,453
Hey guys, guys, come on now, please.
What did I say about swearing?

30
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:42,464
That it's funny.

31
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:47,647
Just put the phone away.
Put the phone away, now.

32
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,245
Okay, well thanks.

33
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:55,418
Jeff, the SAT NAV is broken.

34
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:57,727
What's the matter with it?

35
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:00,753
It just says we are
completely off the map.

36
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:02,835
Could it be isn't it
updated or something?

37
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,242
How do you date it?

38
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:05,500
Plug it into a laptop.

39
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:09,629
Here, this is a trooper
map, Coordinance Survey.

40
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,599
And they never lie.

41
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:15,736
There you are, you see?
Mortlake.

42
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:18,583
Right up the end of this road.
Carry on.

43
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:39,500
- Are we there yet, Jeff?
- No.

44
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:51,791
I don't know why you bother her?

45
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,866
She ain't going to talk.
She like a mute or something.

46
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:58,683
- Woah? What respect?
- No, no, it means she gonna talk.

47
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:02,566
Woah!  Didn't know
you could talk, Tim.

48
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:05,102
Yeah!  Cut it out man.
Giving me a headache back there.

49
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:07,057
We don't want your
life story, man. Alright!

50
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:24,220
- Ow!  You fucking bitch!
- Well, what's going on, huh?

51
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:25,965
Calm down, please.

52
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,368
Hey, Tim ..

53
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:36,453
- Got any sexy pics on your phone?
- No, why?

54
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:41,033
Not?  Well, you're a
bump behind there?

55
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,150
- Is he always such a prick?
- Yeah.

56
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:51,766
Oi Jeff, can we smoke?
I definitely need a smoke, mate.

57
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,556
- Oi Jeff. Are we there yet?
- No, twat, we're not fucking there yet!

58
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,142
Sorry.

59
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:16,819
- I think we're there, Jeff.  Yeah.
- Further up the road, I think.

60
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:21,947
Trust... trust.  Yeah.
Okay, further up.  Keep going.

61
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:23,120
- Really?
- Yeah.

62
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:26,581
Okay.
Why is it not on here?

63
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:37,329
"The Dirty Hole"?
That's charming.

64
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,094
Well, Mortlake is one of the
north's oldest coal towns.

65
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:42,517
I suspect the name
probably refers to mining.

66
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:45,027
You'll like that, yeah old Jeff?

67
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,984
The cottage should
be straight up here.

68
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:01,622
Well, it's been
certainly rustic, isn't it?

69
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:05,708
- Rustic?
- This gonna be shit.

70
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:23,553
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

71
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:42,589
We have another ... another 200 yards.
First one to see it gets a prize.

72
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:06,813
Everybody out.

73
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,759
Come out and get some fresh air.

74
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:17,506
Wonderful, huh?

75
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,158
No, I'm away till Monday.
I called you not to tweet me.

76
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,823
Yeah.  No, I can't decide.
Yeah, alright, so. Just that ...

77
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,639
- Dwight, phone please?
- What?

78
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,814
We haven't come all the way out
here to look at another way of life

79
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:37,454
so you can miss it just cos you're
chatting to late on the phone or

80
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:40,724
or viewing dirty pics, have we?
Hmm.  Phone please.

81
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:46,391
No, I'm getting licked from some idiot.
Yeah, alright.  Later.

82
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,400
Good lad.  Okay.
Same applies to everybody.

83
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:59,366
Just put your phones in the bag,
so we can appreciate our environment.

84
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:02,607
- A fucking joke.
- Okay.  Thank you.

85
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:05,136
Great!

86
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,549
- What are you thinking?
- What am I thinking?

87
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:21,739
Well, I think that I've stayed in
better squats than this, Jeff, really.

88
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:25,061
Don't judge a book
by it's cover, hmm.

89
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:33,038
Wow!

90
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:41,046
- What's this?
- A poor house.

91
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,673
Shit cover.  Shit book.

92
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,847
We need to locate
the fuse box, that's all.

93
00:10:52,837 --> 00:10:54,658
Hmm.  That's odd.

94
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:58,685
Are you worried?
Are you sure?

95
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:01,268
Come on.

96
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,458
Whoa! Get English thing, all right!

97
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,519
- What are you doing, Dwight? Stop it!
- Oh, come on. I'm fucking joking around.

98
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,330
- No, you're not joking. If you want you
can open the car all the way in and ...

99
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,996
- Stop it.
- Oh, what's it all about?

100
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:41,852
- She was joking.
- Dennis tried to poke ya?

101
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,458
- Alright, go on.
- Chaotic, it is.

102
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:48,769
Oh, come on guys.  Cheer up.
We just got the old boiler going.

103
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,394
I know it's a little bit
ramshackled and a little bit dusty.

104
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,875
We are not here on holiday,
are we?  This is the point.

105
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,187
Work together as a team.
Pull together, as one.

106
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:00,710
And we can start by clearing this
place up together.  How about that?

107
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:03,554
Yeah, I'm not sleeping in this Jeff
mate, it's a fucking shithole.

108
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:05,276
Yeah, seriously.
Am I missing the tip?

109
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:08,982
Yeah, okay.  I know it is a bit of a
shithole, guys, but we are in now.

110
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:11,315
So we better get
working together as a team.

111
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:14,527
And a good team that works
together hard, plays hard.

112
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:17,644
Get all cleaned up
and go down to the pub.

113
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:21,486
Yeah, can we wait outside.
Please, Kate, come.

114
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:33,475
Jeff, what is your problem?
I was just having a laugh.

115
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:35,593
Do you think it is wise
taking these kids to a pub?

116
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:39,485
I mean, some of them have had alcohol
issues.  Now, Dwight would be a problem.

117
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,636
I wasn't going to get
them pissed in giving message.

118
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:46,254
I was just trying to motivate them and
have a bit of a laugh. Have a bit of fun.

119
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,509
Jeff, we are care-workers,
we're not their parents.

120
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:52,299
Why do you always
insist on alienating yourself?

121
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,754
- Alienate?
- Yes, alienate.

122
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,907
You think I'm
alienating people just

123
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:58,531
because I'm trying to
impose a few rules, huh?

124
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:02,146
See, there you go again. Rules.
Rules are meant to be broken.

125
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,133
These kids are heavy
because they bite rules, Jeff.

126
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:11,288
Why don't just chill out, have some
fun and call me about a slut like I did.

127
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:16,530
- Finished?
- Yeah. I'm finished actually. Thank you.

128
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,446
Good.

129
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:31,334
Look at this stuff.  Like it's
been here for years.  What is it?

130
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:33,630
We need this thing along.

131
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:36,774
Yeah, no I'm not walking down
to the door.  Hey fuck that.

132
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:41,602
Gosh!

133
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,695
Think there's something
valuable in this one as well.

134
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,014
Valuable, you say?

135
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:52,325
- Yeah, I think so.
- Alright.

136
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:54,294
<i>Thank you chief.</i>

137
00:13:55,412 --> 00:14:00,920
Yeah, well done, guys.
This is a very, very real achievement.

138
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,037
I think what this proves is that we,

139
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:06,306
we as a group from different
backgrounds with different...

140
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:09,079
- Come to a point!
- Thank you, Dwight.

141
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,372
From different backgrounds
with different problems,

142
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:15,200
when we work together as a group,
see we can really affect change.

143
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:18,807
Not really reflects well on
each and everyone of you.

144
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:25,751
You may not know, but what you learn to
do is turn your negatives into positives.

145
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,834
Let's go stay with you for the rest of
your lives. As you get older and storm ...

146
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:39,883
Alienating.

147
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:51,461
Alright.  Come on
everyone.  Cheer up.

148
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:56,041
Let's walk to the pub, can I see his
name.  We've  been driving all day.

149
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:58,889
- He's taking a piss.
- Less of the lip, Dwight.

150
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,400
- Find any of my craps in it, what it is?
- Your what?

151
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:07,202
- My craps.
- I told you to bring
some proper shoes, Zeb.

152
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:11,535
What do you mean proper?   Do you
know proper?  Can't get even in the UK.

153
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:15,466
- Hip?
- Put you in 20 crib, Kate.

154
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,077
They must have something
you can rob, man.

155
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,708
Yeah, agree.

156
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:25,428
I gave some girl an orgasm last night.
She only puff inside and out.

157
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:31,907
- Okay now.  Go all out wood.
- What about it?

158
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:36,486
Well, if I set fire in it.
Go off in seconds, huh?

159
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:46,246
The dirty hole.

160
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:50,325
Until one, guys.

161
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:55,858
Come on.  In we go.
That's it.

162
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,362
- Dwight, please behave, please.
- Yeah, yes I will.

163
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:14,999
Hi there.

164
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,378
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

165
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,234
You three, move.  Get on to the back bar.
Give guests who might sit down.

166
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:40,830
Move.

167
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:44,675
- There you go.
- Thank you.

168
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:53,551
Thanks.  Queen Pub.

169
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:58,120
I've had it called a few things
in my time, but that's a new one.

170
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:03,185
1582 these were built.   Used to
be a stop-off road aye women.

171
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,908
These walls lives in Sumesides.

172
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:10,329
I bet they are.
Quite amazing.

173
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:16,293
Lovely.

174
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:27,021
Right, I'll get the menu, then.

175
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:29,926
Right, who wants to drink?

176
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,941
- One.
- Yeah, I'll have one of that, please.

177
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:35,041
- Two Cokes.  Sam?
- Coke.

178
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,764
- Tim?
- Yeah, I'll have a coke. Thanks, Kate.

179
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,931
Now well, what are you up to?

180
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:46,635
Well, I could do with
some hot food, actually.

181
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,678
- Did you see the sign?
- Yes, yes, the hot food sign.

182
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:55,052
No.  Sign says "not food", not "hot food".

183
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:56,830
- Not food either.
- Right.

184
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,654
- We don't get it for that crown.
- Umm.

185
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:03,063
We don't have fun delight
food.  We got scrunchions.

186
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:08,234
Oh, yes.  Well, two bags of
scrunchions then.  Thank you.

187
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:12,569
- I'm starving.
- Well, I'm starving too.

188
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:18,039
- Well?
- Pub's special.  Pork scrunchions.

189
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:23,323
I am afraid but there are two types.
Hairy and smelly.

190
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,332
- Jeff, that's not funny.
- It's alright, Kate.  Go with the flow.

191
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:31,290
Plenty of food back at the cottage.  Just
gonna have to head off just without me.

192
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:34,034
Uhm mm.  So much for their reward, then.

193
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:39,124
- Fuck me!  Look at that!
- How disgusting.

194
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:43,926
Home made there.  Wife
makes soup.  Specialty.

195
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:55,074
Yeah.  Taste great.

196
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:57,689
So then, what can I
get you kids to drink?

197
00:18:57,702 --> 00:18:59,992
Six cokes, please.

198
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:05,354
Don't sell coke, Miss.  Not since...
Well, as long as I can remember.

199
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:09,274
- I can make you a lemonade.
- Fucking lemonade.

200
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:15,532
- Six lemonades then, please.
- Right. One minute. I'll make a batch now.

201
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,287
- Lovely, thank you.
- Thanks so much.

202
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:20,238
Lemon fucking-nade.

203
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,925
They are all wrong.
Denim.

204
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:26,560
- Oh mate. You are great.
- Fucking denim.

205
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:27,604
Dwight ...

206
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:30,319
Here we are.
Nice and fresh.

207
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,958
Thank you.  How much
do I owe you for that?

208
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:35,215
Oh no charge.
Hoops on the house.

209
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,833
Thank you very much.
That's very kind of you.

210
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,984
You are just passing through, eh?

211
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:44,801
No, we staying for the weekend. We are
doing our project with the kids, so ...

212
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:49,870
Nearest hostel and camping in Thirsk is
a good 40 mile away. My, don't go there.

213
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:54,436
No, we staying at Ravenswood
Cottage.  Oop, you alright?

214
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:55,948
Don't panic.
It was empty.

215
00:19:57,383 --> 00:20:01,532
Ravenswood?  I didn't know
that folks staying over there.

216
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,152
It thought it's about
condemned, now spunk.

217
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:06,535
It was a bad of state
but we've tidied it all up.

218
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:07,675
Are you okay?

219
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,339
What is wrong with me tonight?
So, clean now, isn't it?

220
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:19,511
Yeah, it is actually.
It's quite cozy.  It's nice.

221
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:22,506
Nice.  Nice.  Very nice.

222
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:24,045
Thank you.

223
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:29,470
Bit dusty.  Cheers.

224
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:52,961
What the fuck was that, Jeff?

225
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,064
Here we go.

226
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:56,648
Here we go, tonight.

227
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:59,402
Okay, everybody,
I want to propose a toast.

228
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:02,741
To a lovely weekend
and a brilliant future.

229
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:04,774
Cheers, everyone.
Cheers.

230
00:21:06,356 --> 00:21:10,175
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I think he is slightly senile.

231
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:16,173
- It tastes like piss!
- Dwight...

232
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,765
Or ... there won't be tomorrow night.

233
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:51,470
The piss is pretty little bad.

234
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,193
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Take it to the back, you dumb-head!

235
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:01,419
Go out laddie.

236
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,917
- Real lemon.
- Have you got a tissue?

237
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:10,218
Real lemons.

238
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:15,426
<i>Guys, will you stop it.</i>

239
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:48,489
Hello.

240
00:22:51,758 --> 00:22:52,985
Who are you?

241
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,931
You from city?

242
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,601
You're pretty.

243
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:12,428
What is your name?

244
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:18,578
Do you like carrots?
Where are you going?

245
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:26,529
- Boy!  Get out!  Go on.  Out!
- What?

246
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,844
You are not a guests in here.

247
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,779
You alright, love?
He's harmless, really.

248
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:41,600
Don't get many new faces.
Excited, that's all.

249
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:44,758
He whatever, yeah,
he a lover not a fighter.

250
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,505
Good to hear.

251
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:49,946
Why, just a word
of warning, though.

252
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:54,599
There's someone around these parts
that care nought for strangers.

253
00:23:54,954 --> 00:24:00,532
But just as long as you keep to yourselves,
everyone is very friendly, you know.

254
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:05,558
Just say you're friends of Jim
of Dirty Hole, they all know me.

255
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:10,186
- That's correct, thanks Jim.
- Thank you.

256
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:15,068
- Sam, are you okay?
- Alright. So?

257
00:24:16,444 --> 00:24:20,902
The cottage we were staying in was a
working farm for people with problems.

258
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:24,471
Place where the troubled could
recuperate away from society.

259
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:27,705
They shut all these kind of
places down in the 1970s.

260
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,194
What kind of problems?

261
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:33,717
People with disability issues mostly.
They also took on the mentally ill.

262
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:36,271
- All under one roof.
- Really?

263
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:40,868
Yeah, very unPC now, I know,
but was the norm back then.

264
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:43,401
Hide the problem people away.

265
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:46,926
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

266
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:48,844
Yeah, that's terrible.

267
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:51,643
So what's the biggest
thing you ever burned?

268
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:53,739
Uhh, my school.

269
00:24:54,914 --> 00:24:56,129
Oh my God.

270
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,561
No, it was empty.
I didn't kill anyone or anything.

271
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:03,224
Cool.

272
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:09,582
Why did you do it?
If you don't mind me asking?

273
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,449
No, it's cold that morning.

274
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:18,470
I was bored.
Fucking shit town.

275
00:25:18,505 --> 00:25:22,408
Shit prospects.
Teachers who didn't give a toss.

276
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:26,823
I mean you sit there with all the other
kids ... all the fucking dickhead kids.

277
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:27,815
Like Dwight?

278
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:29,584
Yeah, exactly like Dwight.

279
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:33,404
I mean, sit there and
let them run the class.

280
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,157
No, I mean, no one learned anything.
The whole system was a fucking joke.

281
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:41,350
- So...
- Ka-boom.

282
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:46,976
Yeah, exactly. Ka-boom.
I burned the fucking system.

283
00:25:52,862 --> 00:25:55,577
Did you sleep alright, darling?

284
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:00,798
- Want some sugar?
- Yeah, please.

285
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,116
I didn't fucking
touch your stuff, dude.

286
00:26:05,117 --> 00:26:07,086
Fucking liar, Dwight.
I know you did.

287
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:08,451
- What's going on, boys?

288
00:26:08,452 --> 00:26:10,694
Hey, I'm starving Kate.
What's for breakfast?

289
00:26:10,714 --> 00:26:11,905
Tim, you okay?

290
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:15,840
I leave my things in order.
That's why I know you used them, right?

291
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,848
Twat didn't take his OCD
pills this morning, did he?

292
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:20,119
- Fuck you Dwight.
- Yeah!

293
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,729
What the fuck you
gonna do, you mug?

294
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,266
Dwight!
Now do you want some breakfast?

295
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:30,177
I want a sausage.  See I like a
sausage.  Do you have one in here?

296
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:33,889
Dude, are you talking about a sausage,
or are you talking about your cock?

297
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:36,658
I thought so.

298
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,941
- Morning, morning.
- Morning.

299
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:42,485
Half past seven, we ought to
get going.  It is a beautiful day.

300
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:45,107
Oh, we're just having some
breakfast.  So Joey Beans.

301
00:26:45,142 --> 00:26:47,915
- Oh, I thought you'd be done by now.
- No, just chatting.

302
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:55,153
Health and safety, I'm afraid.

303
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,373
Well, if it's that,
I not wearing one of these.

304
00:26:58,374 --> 00:27:01,020
It got me out look
like a fucking bin man.

305
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:05,113
- Here's a large one for you.
- A small, please.

306
00:27:05,803 --> 00:27:11,042
- Thanks, Jeff.
- Tim!  Catch!  There you go.

307
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:16,099
Good.  And one for me.
So, ETD ten minutes?

308
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,264
I Roger that.

309
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:27,473
- We'll be ready.
- Good.  I'll be ... just great.

310
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:36,906
Come on.  Don't struggle.

311
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:57,626
Early run.  Let's get these
lights by to Milton Keynes.

312
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:03,263
- Absolutely beautiful.
- It depends.

313
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:08,542
- Man, how much further?
- Boring, ain't got food, does it?

314
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,436
Yeah, bro.

315
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,115
What do you do, huh?

316
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,543
Wait up!

317
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:27,310
- So, what are you doing here, anyway?
- What's it to you?

318
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:30,485
No, I was just saying.

319
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:35,393
- No, looking out for a boy.
- Using a gun?

320
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:39,552
Our boys are close you know.
Looking out for each other.

321
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:45,295
If someones having a gun at my
mate, I'm going to cap that fucker.

322
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:50,733
Bang!

323
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:21,314
Trains! Halleluiah.

324
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:24,699
Nuso arivay.  Come on!

325
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,535
Overcome one-selves.  That's it.

326
00:29:32,513 --> 00:29:33,221
Okay.

327
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:37,302
Good luck.

328
00:29:48,572 --> 00:29:51,513
Look at the graffiti on
that.   It's really nice.

329
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:55,852
Oh yeah.  How did they get
all these down here anyway?

330
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:58,246
One sweet thing.

331
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:01,517
- That's it.
- What thing is going to die?

332
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:04,188
Not really, it's recycling.

333
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:06,716
That's it.
It's a community service game

334
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:09,646
designed to generate funds
while it turns on central skills

335
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:11,049
needed for today's society.

336
00:30:12,814 --> 00:30:13,910
To do what?

337
00:30:14,462 --> 00:30:18,920
It just means astricting
anything of value that is left

338
00:30:18,921 --> 00:30:20,794
and forking on basically.

339
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:21,795
Exactly.

340
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:25,506
- And why didn't you say that?
- Exactly.

341
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,678
Mind the nettles, Zeb.

342
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:41,337
- Tim, get out!
- Tim, out of there, please.

343
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:44,243
Zeb, come on.
Dwight, get the barrow.

344
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,694
Come on!  Chomp, chomp!

345
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:51,574
Come on.  Here you go.  Here's a
ladder, right.  Here's another one.

346
00:30:54,434 --> 00:30:55,964
Right, there's a toolbox.

347
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:01,115
Okay, you got that?
Right.

348
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,071
- You see this?
- Right, it's Dwight's.

349
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:10,097
- Ooh, the wheelbarrow, Zeb!
- Be careful!  Careful.

350
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:15,493
- Just wait for us!
- Maybe we should leave a note?

351
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:18,417
Yeah, well maybe someone
should be here to help us.

352
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,805
What, did you arrange for
somebody to come and help us?

353
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,281
Yeah, of course I arranged for
someone to come and help us.

354
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:24,006
Where are they?

355
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:24,968
I don't know.

356
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:28,748
Well, we can't take those
without telling someone.

357
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:30,403
Well, maybe we should give a note.

358
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:43,237
Copper, aluminum,
brass, zinc, solenoids.

359
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:45,449
You are amazed what
treasures we gonna ...

360
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,420
Yeah, but Jeff, how are we
supposed to know what is what?

361
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:51,924
Because I've got a checklist here and
I'm going to split into two teams.

362
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:57,092
Okay A-Team,
it's you, Sam, and me

363
00:31:57,093 --> 00:32:00,015
and Zeb, Dwight
and Jeff in the B team.

364
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,633
The team to get the most
valuable material wins.

365
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,545
- Win what?
- Well there was no prize, Zeb.

366
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,684
- What's the point then?
- Prize is sense of achievement.

367
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,940
Okay, twenty quid the A team wins.

368
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:16,425
- Oh, come on, Jeffry.
What you waiting for?

369
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:17,987
Put your money, they
ain't gonna loose.

370
00:32:17,988 --> 00:32:19,987
All right.
Why the bloody hell not?

371
00:32:24,937 --> 00:32:28,115
You're on.  High five.
Come on kid.

372
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:35,549
Listen guys, I just
wanted to say that

373
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,791
if you have anything to chat to me about
anything, I'm there you know , if not

374
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,509
we don't spend that
much time on our own, but,

375
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,086
yeah, I just wanted
you to know that.

376
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,788
It's not just about finding copper,
you know, this weekend,

377
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:51,805
it's about just
having a bit of fun, and ...

378
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,208
- Yeah.  Cheers Kate.
- Yeah.

379
00:32:55,209 --> 00:33:01,892
- Am I?
- You are ... beautiful.

380
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:09,420
Right.  Well, kind of take a look
in there, so let's just start.

381
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:13,314
I don't know, I mean, I think
these are Mark IIIs, you know and

382
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:18,373
pretty sure the copper's back in
there.  Nothing much is down there.

383
00:33:18,408 --> 00:33:21,035
- Yeah, is copper good?
- Yeah, copper's worth much.

384
00:33:21,036 --> 00:33:22,359
- Is it?
- Yeah.

385
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,761
Let's go on out there.

386
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:34,530
- What the fuck you think you're doing?
- Sorry, Jeff.

387
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:39,573
Now stop vandalizing and salvage!
There is a difference.

388
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,532
How are we going to find anything
we need?  This is a shit hole.

389
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:50,696
What?

390
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:51,725
Look at the place.

391
00:33:52,026 --> 00:33:54,962
We're not actually going to
do it, that's what I want.

392
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:57,362
- Fuck that, man.
- Yeah.

393
00:33:59,802 --> 00:34:02,692
Fuck it.  Let's just fuck it up.

394
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:06,486
- Come on Zeb!
- Fuck it!

395
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,128
Come on, come on, come on!

396
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,687
Oh yeah.
Fuck it up, babe.

397
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:25,011
- Get up!
- Oh shit!

398
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:41,462
- Right.  Which one first?
- Ehh, then I'll do this one, huh?

399
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:44,776
- It's a Mark II, and I think
these have got copper to it.

400
00:34:44,777 --> 00:34:46,727
Okay, okay, how do
you know it's a Mark II?

401
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:49,916
- Well, it says there, isn't it?
- Right from there also have.

402
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:51,311
I do not know it.

403
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:53,104
- Is the lines okay?
- Yeah.

404
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:53,887
Chop! Chop!

405
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:56,186
Watch yourself on this, Tim.

406
00:34:56,421 --> 00:35:01,903
Alright. Okay.
That was Jeff's twenty quid.

407
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:05,963
Are you alright?  Go on.  Are you
willing to pick up the toolbox, Kate?

408
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:10,614
Here you go.

409
00:35:14,682 --> 00:35:16,985
- Yeah, yeah, I just gotta find cups.
- Okay.

410
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,529
What is that?

411
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,156
- Stink center.
- Come here.

412
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:43,011
Hello?

413
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,972
Oh, wicked.
Knock it out.

414
00:35:52,927 --> 00:35:58,007
Oh well, that is lead in there.
Fucking Jesus.

415
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,637
Hey, I got copper
cable for you there.

416
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:12,784
Jeff?

417
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:27,892
Hello?  Who's there?

418
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:21,072
Guys! Guys!
Please, what are you thinking?

419
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,153
Chill out, please.
Just calm down.

420
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,899
You know, you can't just smash
things up all day long. alright.

421
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,725
Why?

422
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,593
I believe if you continue, I'll say
you screwed up the weekend.

423
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:30,982
There's a good
chance you'll go to jail.

424
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:33,178
Well , bull if Jeff's unit say that.

425
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:35,249
Well, you're right then.
I'll probably wouldn't.

426
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,651
Just toe the line, alright?

427
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:50,574
Yo, Sam.  Come here.

428
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,657
What?

429
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:09,051
- It wasn't me.
- I didn't say it was.

430
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:16,855
- Do not want to go find out what it is?
- Yeah.

431
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:18,983
What do you think it is?

432
00:38:19,084 --> 00:38:23,001
The grass burns easy.
It's oil based.  Come on!

433
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:30,194
Tim?

434
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:36,259
Sam?

435
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:52,585
- What is it?
- I don't know.

436
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,431
Fuck!
It's an animal!

437
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:04,093
Those sick bastards!
Sam, I'm going to free this one.

438
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,626
Come on, man.
It's alright. Come on, man.

439
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:11,607
Go ahead!  Go ahead.

440
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:13,591
Go on kid.

441
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:16,915
- That's our sense of achievement.
- Yeah.

442
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:20,345
Oh fuck!

443
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:39,218
Kate!

444
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:40,419
Kate!

445
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:41,833
Kate!

446
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,718
Kate!

447
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:45,548
Kate!

448
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:55,922
Kate!

449
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,192
Kate!

450
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:04,198
Hello pretty.

451
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:09,621
Time for one of your five a day.
Give it to me, girl.

452
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:17,259
Don't worry, girl.
We've got this for your boyfriend.

453
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:41,900
Let him go now.
Now!

454
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:43,977
Let him go.

455
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,621
- Tim! Get Jeff!
- Jeff!

456
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:52,259
What are you doing to us?
Freak!

457
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:58,314
- What is going on?
- He was attacking Tim and Sam.

458
00:40:58,315 --> 00:41:01,431
- Let me go, you fucking twat!
- Shut up!

459
00:41:02,324 --> 00:41:05,107
Alright. Alright.
Let him go.

460
00:41:08,562 --> 00:41:10,800
Can someone mind telling
me what's going on here?

461
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,412
These sick bastards. They ...
come in a manner of ...

462
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:17,204
It was assaulting Sam,
So I hit him with a spade.

463
00:41:17,205 --> 00:41:19,124
He's smoking at me twice!

464
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:21,869
Hey you!
Be quiet!

465
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,809
Maybe he's only lacking ...

466
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,865
And he was burning
live animals as well.

467
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:29,586
- Burning animals?
- Yeah, they're all sick.

468
00:41:33,546 --> 00:41:35,554
Those are my fucking tools.

469
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:38,440
Ask me how it must
have gotten there.

470
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:42,870
- Alright. They're your tools, huh.
- Hmm.

471
00:41:42,871 --> 00:41:45,042
You have a ...
so you have them, alright.

472
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:48,797
There you go. We obey you.
We back off.  Just go!

473
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:58,782
If you come any one of them kids again
with so much as a bloody runner bean ...

474
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:01,739
I swear to God
I will bloody do you.

475
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:10,556
She wants it all.

476
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,937
Take your tools and piss off
okay, and I'm warning you.

477
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:19,400
Ooh, my tools gonna be up her arse.

478
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:21,970
Right up to its brouts.

479
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:27,026
Get out!  Go away.  Go!
Fuck up you filthy bastards.

480
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:29,019
Go on.  Get out!

481
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:34,837
Just get out!
Before I knock your fucking skull off!

482
00:42:37,193 --> 00:42:41,445
Shit!  Jeff!  Are you okay?
Oh God.

483
00:42:42,284 --> 00:42:44,833
It's okay, I'm fine.
Oh, Jesus!

484
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,334
It's alright.  It's okay.

485
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,772
No, Zeb!  Get us off the field!

486
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:55,463
We need phone an ambulance, Jeff.
Where's your phone?

487
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,251
They're at the house.

488
00:42:58,252 --> 00:43:00,907
Timmy, give me a
tourniquet, a rope or a belt.

489
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,767
We can't give up. Quick!

490
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,306
That's right.
Hold the cut.

491
00:43:11,307 --> 00:43:14,839
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Fuck!

492
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:17,813
We need some help!

493
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:22,153
Stop!

494
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:27,891
Dwight!
Go and find something.

495
00:43:27,892 --> 00:43:30,862
We need to take him down the hill.
Quick!

496
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:03,073
Let me tell thee all,
the fate that did befall...

497
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:06,427
Hey by, hey by grown.

498
00:44:06,962 --> 00:44:11,101
When outsiders came and
tried to stake a claim ...

499
00:44:11,202 --> 00:44:14,429
Hey by, hey by grown.

500
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:19,276
Next thing got the note, they want to go...

501
00:44:19,477 --> 00:44:22,616
Hey by, hey by go.

502
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:27,211
So we pulled down father's
jacks and chop off all his legs...

503
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,079
Somebody please call an ambulance!

504
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,771
Mr. Lockwood, please,
please call an ambulance!

505
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:33,713
Bloody nora.

506
00:44:33,948 --> 00:44:37,635
Brendan, get this on.  Get him in
the kitchen, put him on the table.

507
00:44:37,826 --> 00:44:40,416
No, no we need a phone.
He needs an ambulance.

508
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:43,166
He's losing most of the blood, please.
Basically he's ...

509
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:47,219
It's all right love.  Let's get him
comfortable till ambulance arrives.

510
00:44:47,297 --> 00:44:50,413
That's a good forty miles of country
roads.  It will be at least an hour.

511
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:53,556
We can't wait an hour.
He's lost too much blood.

512
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:54,826
That's how long it takes.

513
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,283
Jeff.

514
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,253
Jeff!

515
00:45:03,537 --> 00:45:07,106
- Okay.  Be careful with him.
- Tim, help me with his legs.

516
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:12,509
- Sorry mate.
- That's gonna teach us

517
00:45:14,007 --> 00:45:16,827
- What happened?
- Those lads attacked us in there!

518
00:45:16,828 --> 00:45:19,024
- What lads?
- It's locals.  And the way he threw out.

519
00:45:20,264 --> 00:45:24,219
- What did they do to want us threw out?
- It's only me and Sam, making two of us.

520
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:27,224
- They were burning animals.
- And they attacked you say?

521
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:33,065
- Fucking inbred cunts started it.
- Hey! But not all cunts from around here.

522
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:34,978
The man is dying, please!

523
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,708
Why don't we call the
police, don't you see?

524
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:41,150
- Yeah, Wilf's on the phone.  Now!
- We need to clean it.

525
00:45:41,151 --> 00:45:42,745
We need to take his trousers off.

526
00:45:42,746 --> 00:45:46,508
Alright pal.  I'll give you
something to ease the pain.

527
00:45:58,506 --> 00:45:59,667
Give me that!

528
00:46:09,168 --> 00:46:12,524
Hey!  You dark bastard!

529
00:46:12,525 --> 00:46:16,739
You ...fucking bastard.

530
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,000
Fucking ... bastard.

531
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:22,573
Don't give me that shit, what.

532
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:25,541
You!
And then fuck it up Fridays.

533
00:46:25,842 --> 00:46:27,745
I didn't do now.

534
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:31,720
Didn't do know.
The book, you fucking scoundrel.

535
00:46:31,871 --> 00:46:35,645
What fucking not?

536
00:46:35,643 --> 00:46:39,482
He did fell over. He got a
life in something on my own.

537
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:40,954
He ripped them down both.

538
00:46:41,655 --> 00:46:42,854
You what?

539
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:45,116
He even scold Bathius.

540
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:53,005
- Then he tripped up and he cut himself.
- Huh, he fell over.

541
00:46:53,006 --> 00:46:56,583
- It won't grace!
- Why didn't you say so?

542
00:46:57,753 --> 00:47:01,724
Anyway, can't take them here.

543
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:11,651
Put the word out.  About an early show.
Free admission.  And then scrunchions.

544
00:47:17,374 --> 00:47:22,249
Right.  I want this place
spotless.  Feed him to pigs.

545
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,895
- Ah, he must weigh a ton, Dad.
- Well, chop him up then!

546
00:47:30,185 --> 00:47:33,258
- Fucking hot in here.
- Dwight, please.

547
00:47:34,442 --> 00:47:37,875
- What the fuck did you do?
- Will you shut the fuck up, Dwight!

548
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:41,335
Oh, they burning animals, Ray.
They are, then set them free.

549
00:47:41,436 --> 00:47:43,225
You fucking do gooders.

550
00:47:43,226 --> 00:47:46,217
You know, you and your spark of
a girlfriend are fucked, you know that.

551
00:47:46,219 --> 00:47:48,550
For fuck sake, Dwight!

552
00:47:48,896 --> 00:47:52,340
We are all going to fucking die
if we don't stick together.

553
00:47:52,341 --> 00:47:54,406
Do you understand me, eh?

554
00:47:56,833 --> 00:48:01,436
Think of something!   We've gotta get
out of here!  They're gonna come back.

555
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:05,823
Ah, I think I can get us out of here.
Do you see something really sharp.

556
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,991
Anything.  It's too thick.

557
00:48:08,992 --> 00:48:10,755
It's gonna fit in the
lock.  It's too thick.

558
00:48:13,385 --> 00:48:14,700
- Tim
- What?

559
00:48:14,703 --> 00:48:16,956
- Have you got anything?
- No!  I fucking haven't.

560
00:48:16,967 --> 00:48:17,961
Think then!

561
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:21,204
- I have a ...
- Perfect.  That's perfect.

562
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:25,855
- Come on!
- Be patient.

563
00:48:25,856 --> 00:48:28,264
- Come on, hurry!
- Calm down.

564
00:48:28,484 --> 00:48:32,366
- Look at me. I'll ...
- I'll poke a giant if you want!

565
00:48:33,673 --> 00:48:36,447
- Okay calm down,  it's okay.
- Come on!

566
00:48:37,265 --> 00:48:38,443
Come on.

567
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:44,815
Well, that's a lot ladies.

568
00:48:44,816 --> 00:48:48,809
- Let's say it's their ...
- Any one want this?

569
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:50,786
God!

570
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:56,544
I hear there's a show tonight.
Can I come?

571
00:48:59,434 --> 00:49:03,271
- Don't know.  Can't hear you, Ron.
- Will you ask your dad?

572
00:49:03,948 --> 00:49:10,673
- I'll ask.  No promises.
- Okay you do that. I might see you later.

573
00:49:11,431 --> 00:49:12,529
Tonight?

574
00:49:13,255 --> 00:49:18,403
Excuse me.  Come on Turkish.
We're going to a show.

575
00:49:21,868 --> 00:49:23,102
Look what he did.

576
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:37,972
Which one?

577
00:49:40,294 --> 00:49:43,916
Please, we don't understand why
you're doing this.  What's going on?

578
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:46,278
What the fuck is happening?
We have not done anything.

579
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:48,676
- Alright, love, alright.
- Please let us just go.

580
00:49:48,977 --> 00:49:52,580
- I don't understand!
- Just shut your fucking cake hole!

581
00:49:52,582 --> 00:49:56,633
Or do you want to be next?   Is
that it?  What do you reckon, son?

582
00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:02,160
- No, save her for a bit. She is ...
- No.  Stop.

583
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,727
Fuck off!

584
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:18,082
Whatever you want with us, please leave
us alone, please.  Please leave us alone.

585
00:50:21,447 --> 00:50:22,294
Sam!

586
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:25,076
Let me go, I say.

587
00:50:25,604 --> 00:50:26,651
Sam!

588
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,804
Open this fucking door!

589
00:50:34,843 --> 00:50:37,117
Hurry up.
Get him over to the barn.

590
00:50:41,255 --> 00:50:45,162
Help!  Someone.
Somebody come help me, please!

591
00:50:51,406 --> 00:50:55,178
Get off me please!
Let me go!

592
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:03,321
What are you doing?
Damn it!

593
00:51:05,755 --> 00:51:06,835
Get off me!

594
00:51:11,116 --> 00:51:12,376
I swear, I won't...

595
00:51:14,357 --> 00:51:15,717
How you guys doing?

596
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:19,534
What's he doing?

597
00:51:29,147 --> 00:51:30,869
You're crazy fuck!

598
00:51:34,444 --> 00:51:37,236
Your father, he was best.

599
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:41,388
He knew how to put on a show.
Put real pizazz into it.

600
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:46,675
Please, let me go.  I won't
tell anyone.  Just let me go.

601
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:49,117
What is wrong with you?

602
00:51:52,397 --> 00:51:55,885
The laughter.  And dancing.

603
00:51:58,338 --> 00:52:02,603
I do a good job.
Too messy.

604
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,321
Talking of you bastard.

605
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:21,058
Jesus.  Why don't you let me go?
You fucking ugly bastard!

606
00:52:29,402 --> 00:52:31,597
Watts, you can go.

607
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:36,910
What you gonna do?

608
00:52:44,588 --> 00:52:45,907
What are you doing?

609
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:50,964
I'm going to make you famous, lad.

610
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:55,864
What's wrong with you?
Fucking mad!

611
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,143
Help!

612
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,656
I need help.  Help!

613
00:53:12,363 --> 00:53:17,083
Let me tell you all
when I wake up this ...

614
00:53:18,084 --> 00:53:21,688
Day by, bygone

615
00:53:23,689 --> 00:53:28,355
Went outside his king and
started to stake a claim

616
00:53:29,156 --> 00:53:32,898
Day by, bygone.

617
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:38,937
Pulled down father's pants,
and chopped off both his legs...

618
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,817
Open this fucking door!

619
00:53:42,134 --> 00:53:45,200
Oh fuck. Fuck!

620
00:53:47,742 --> 00:53:48,650
Oh man!

621
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:52,597
What do you want me doing?
What the fuck is going on?

622
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,718
And took his gutsy wife
and buried her alive...

623
00:53:57,819 --> 00:54:01,725
Day by, day bygone.

624
00:54:24,023 --> 00:54:27,785
Get my shirt ready for the second show.
This one will be covered in shit.

625
00:54:30,988 --> 00:54:35,792
Day by day bygone.

626
00:54:41,597 --> 00:54:48,372
Oh, you beautiful, beautiful
people.  Except for you.

627
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,197
It's not your face or
your neck just grown up?

628
00:54:52,779 --> 00:54:54,415
Only joking.

629
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:59,848
No, but seriously folks, it's great to
be back with all the familiar faces.

630
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:02,712
And exciting news.

631
00:55:02,747 --> 00:55:09,648
A little birdie tells me we've
got shows lined up all week.

632
00:55:09,649 --> 00:55:14,842
Same time, same place,
etcetera, etcetera.

633
00:55:14,877 --> 00:55:23,272
So, without further ado,
on with the show.

634
00:56:31,035 --> 00:56:32,827
Leave me alone, please!

635
00:56:33,902 --> 00:56:38,263
You see up in the nose.
Let's see what can fit up there.

636
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:54,240
- Bastard!
- Calm down, please Tim.

637
00:56:55,098 --> 00:56:57,619
- I can't.
- It's not gonna fucking work, mate.

638
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,676
And it's worth a try, yeah.
It's worth a try, mate.

639
00:57:00,677 --> 00:57:02,774
Oh, fuck out of here.

640
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:06,053
- Don't shout, please!
- We gonna get the fuck out of here, Kate!

641
00:57:13,873 --> 00:57:15,303
Do you like that?

642
00:58:12,123 --> 00:58:14,021
Thank you very much.

643
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:08,074
Nearly got it.
Come on. Come on.

644
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,634
Come on!

645
00:59:23,044 --> 00:59:27,909
One for you.
And one for me.

646
00:59:30,244 --> 00:59:32,071
One for you.

647
00:59:34,736 --> 00:59:36,755
And one for me.

648
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,249
- Hello Wilf.
- Hey Ron.

649
00:59:46,436 --> 00:59:52,568
I hear there is a show on today.
I bet it's a good crowd?

650
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,525
Ahh, just a few.

651
00:59:56,561 --> 01:00:00,643
Don't be enough room for
one more, would there?

652
01:00:00,644 --> 01:00:01,550
Sorry, Ron.

653
01:00:01,743 --> 01:00:04,788
Jim said, they don't take
to your fucking little rat

654
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:06,468
after what happened the last time.

655
01:00:06,626 --> 01:00:10,154
It won't happen again.
I've left the little fella at home.

656
01:00:15,753 --> 01:00:18,067
Don't take this personally, Ron.

657
01:00:23,025 --> 01:00:24,561
Now, fuck off.

658
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:28,503
- Fork best there?
- The best.

659
01:00:28,938 --> 01:00:31,480
- Maybe next time.
- Maybe next time.

660
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:32,637
Alright.

661
01:00:40,502 --> 01:00:45,552
One for you.
And one for me.

662
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:24,264
Help!

663
01:01:33,675 --> 01:01:37,117
Shut up.  Okay,
don't say anything.

664
01:01:37,176 --> 01:01:39,918
The door is open now.
Wait now. Wait there.

665
01:01:46,342 --> 01:01:48,952
Well, what is there for all
of you to see about, eh, eh?

666
01:01:49,484 --> 01:01:54,684
Now don't go away, because we've got
a bonus attraction coming over next.

667
01:01:54,485 --> 01:01:56,895
The house special.

668
01:01:58,313 --> 01:02:00,831
Right after this intermission.

669
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:05,200
We've been expecting
requests.  So don't be shy.

670
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:17,353
Hey, get another one now.

671
01:02:17,354 --> 01:02:21,440
Get the shit brother and
get that bookey off your head.

672
01:02:46,252 --> 01:02:47,161
Hey, you!

673
01:02:53,246 --> 01:02:55,185
Come on, what you waiting for!
Go!

674
01:02:59,481 --> 01:03:01,511
- Dwight!
- Dwight!

675
01:03:02,498 --> 01:03:05,182
Move!  Run!

676
01:03:06,026 --> 01:03:07,073
Dwight!

677
01:03:07,515 --> 01:03:08,641
What the fuck!

678
01:03:08,642 --> 01:03:09,908
Dwight!  Come on!

679
01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:14,737
Stay the fuck down!

680
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:16,422
Dwight!

681
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:19,181
Come here you bastard!

682
01:03:19,182 --> 01:03:20,061
Kate!

683
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,119
Fuck it!  Go!

684
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:21,987
Come in.

685
01:03:24,938 --> 01:03:25,610
No!

686
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:30,484
Kate!  Come on.

687
01:03:31,012 --> 01:03:31,903
Fighter!

688
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:34,763
Stop it!

689
01:03:34,764 --> 01:03:37,228
Come here little girl.
Come to Wilsie.

690
01:03:37,229 --> 01:03:38,109
Dwight!

691
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:39,839
Kate, come on!

692
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,825
Go to hell!

693
01:03:40,926 --> 01:03:42,318
Dwight!

694
01:03:45,886 --> 01:03:47,339
Dwight!

695
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:56,954
- Where did they go?
- They took the hook road.

696
01:03:57,412 --> 01:03:59,271
- Don't get stabbed next.
- What?

697
01:03:59,272 --> 01:04:02,031
- Don't worry about that.
Taste that.

698
01:04:04,237 --> 01:04:07,863
Get that shit to me father now.
I clean up.

699
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,207
Go get the others, piss.

700
01:04:09,818 --> 01:04:10,898
Bring 'em back.

701
01:04:13,915 --> 01:04:15,442
We gonna fucking eat well tonight.

702
01:04:16,968 --> 01:04:18,976
Keep coming!  Come on!

703
01:04:21,922 --> 01:04:23,161
- Stop!
- Come on!

704
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:25,448
Come on, we gotta
get back to the cottage.

705
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:28,359
Are you okay?

706
01:04:28,709 --> 01:04:30,599
- Watch you step.
- Yeah.
- Come on!

707
01:04:43,552 --> 01:04:47,268
Come on, Cole.  It's about
timing in that light next.

708
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:48,886
Get the wig on him.

709
01:04:56,348 --> 01:04:57,470
Aunt Sally.

710
01:05:00,111 --> 01:05:02,011
You ready?
Away then.

711
01:05:17,795 --> 01:05:21,654
Gentlemen, ladies, and Angus.

712
01:05:24,948 --> 01:05:30,085
You have had your first course, but that
was shite compared to the main attraction.

713
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:36,990
I give you the not quite
right, most dishonourable ...

714
01:05:36,992 --> 01:05:43,689
... Fisher and his
astounding dirty vessels.

715
01:06:24,524 --> 01:06:25,880
- I haven't got the keys.
- Huh?

716
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:28,483
- I haven't got the keys.
- Then bring me some other keys.

717
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,618
I'm fucking not giving the bag.
I haven't got the keys.

718
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:33,339
- Which means it's inside the fucking bag.
- It's not my fault.

719
01:06:34,636 --> 01:06:36,664
Oh my God!

720
01:06:39,335 --> 01:06:41,779
Shut up Sam, for fuck sake!

721
01:06:42,861 --> 01:06:45,949
- What we gonna do?
- We're fucked!

722
01:06:50,555 --> 01:06:51,382
Move!

723
01:06:57,584 --> 01:06:58,732
Open the door!

724
01:07:02,616 --> 01:07:05,019
- Come on, Tim.  Come on.
- I'm trying!

725
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,200
- Hurry up!
- Run!

726
01:07:10,108 --> 01:07:12,943
Come on!  Come on!
Go!

727
01:07:16,959 --> 01:07:18,843
- Come on.
- Fuck it here, Tim.

728
01:07:18,844 --> 01:07:19,822
Oh my God!

729
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:25,175
- Oh fuck!
- Stay down!

730
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:26,876
Fuck!

731
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:37,579
Dirty!  Dirty! ....

732
01:07:44,105 --> 01:07:49,455
Dirty! Dirty, dirty, ...

733
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:51,471
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

734
01:07:51,472 --> 01:07:57,612
Welcome to a special show
that is ultimately dirty.

735
01:07:57,655 --> 01:08:01,150
But first, a little word
about health and safety.

736
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:05,829
You've all got your goggles.  I want you
all to put them on now like your eyes.

737
01:08:09,695 --> 01:08:12,175
Fine.
That's good.

738
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:14,563
Let's crack 'em, baby, shall we?

739
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:28,768
Let's see if the
old girl still works.

740
01:08:38,242 --> 01:08:42,824
Right then. Who wants this
hookah, man?  You or your mule?

741
01:08:43,373 --> 01:08:48,119
What about you, sir?
This hook you?

742
01:08:52,902 --> 01:08:55,766
Ooh, did someone
do a rotten today?

743
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:59,675
What is there lallu?
Stick you over the arse?

744
01:08:59,676 --> 01:09:03,666
Ooh, you're dirty, aren't ya.
Alright ya?

745
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:06,575
Say "aye" dirty girl.

746
01:09:09,384 --> 01:09:15,437
- Heh.  Who wants this up them ass?
- He wants!

747
01:09:16,081 --> 01:09:18,526
- Who dude?
- He wants!

748
01:09:18,627 --> 01:09:21,342
- Who dude?
- He wants.

749
01:09:28,282 --> 01:09:30,650
This pretty young
fella here then, ah!

750
01:09:37,684 --> 01:09:43,140
Your fucking animals!
Fuck you!  You cunts!

751
01:09:43,142 --> 01:09:46,054
- Well, you've got a dirty mouth, eh?
- Fuck you!

752
01:09:46,178 --> 01:09:51,195
- Oh, I'll soon sort you out.
- Fuck you!

753
01:09:53,924 --> 01:09:55,607
Come on, maybe out of your seats.

754
01:09:58,415 --> 01:10:01,048
We don't want no
more trouble now, do we?

755
01:10:03,536 --> 01:10:05,366
No!
Stop it!

756
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:14,810
Oh, I can smell ya.

757
01:10:16,155 --> 01:10:17,671
Now, won't we?

758
01:10:21,723 --> 01:10:22,807
I warning you!

759
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:27,529
You'll be in shit like your
main partner.  Now come on out!

760
01:10:37,527 --> 01:10:41,566
I'll be having ya.  I swear.
I'll be having ya.

761
01:10:43,136 --> 01:10:44,752
Oh booger!

762
01:10:46,187 --> 01:10:47,510
Get out, push him off!

763
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:52,638
Oh fuck!
Oh Jesus!

764
01:11:08,941 --> 01:11:15,213
- It's fucking stuck.
- Alright, going 1, 2, 3. Push!

765
01:11:15,514 --> 01:11:18,219
Come on.  Quick!

766
01:11:26,306 --> 01:11:28,730
- Where is he then?
- Who?

767
01:11:28,731 --> 01:11:31,203
Who! You lumpy stupid, Gris.
Where is he?

768
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:35,803
He went after the others.
Don't worry, he's got his gun, though.

769
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:36,901
Going after who?

770
01:11:37,244 --> 01:11:42,307
Outsiders.  When they got
away and went off beyond.

771
01:11:42,426 --> 01:11:45,596
For fuck sake,
why didn't you tell me?

772
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:50,017
He didn't want to stop the show.
But he's got his gun, though.

773
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:52,233
- Fucking, cracking powder. It must be ...
- Fuck off!

774
01:11:52,234 --> 01:11:53,280
Sue me, Jim!

775
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:39,794
Hell!  Wren, get moving your
udder, give him your Podge.

776
01:12:53,463 --> 01:12:59,449
- There is nobody there.
- Right.  We've got work to do, lads.

777
01:12:59,684 --> 01:13:03,987
They won't get far.
Twenty traps laid around these parts.

778
01:13:04,222 --> 01:13:07,296
- They won't leave.
- They never do.

779
01:13:16,322 --> 01:13:18,010
Hey!  Where the fuck are we going?

780
01:13:18,011 --> 01:13:20,516
- We're going back to the cottage.
- No!  We're not going back.

781
01:13:20,551 --> 01:13:22,784
There's nothing else we can do, Sam.
We've got to go back.

782
01:13:22,885 --> 01:13:24,858
Kate, I'm sorry.
But I just meant to.

783
01:13:24,893 --> 01:13:26,269
Well, maybe that's
what they'll think.

784
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:29,841
We need the maps and we need the phones.
We need to tell someone where we are.

785
01:13:30,022 --> 01:13:32,224
Can you just get us
out of here, please?

786
01:13:32,225 --> 01:13:34,029
Sam, that's what
I'm trying to do.

787
01:13:34,803 --> 01:13:35,954
Come on!

788
01:13:56,762 --> 01:13:59,811
Alright, listen to me.
We need to be quick.

789
01:13:59,812 --> 01:14:02,375
We need to look for
the phones and the map.

790
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:04,670
They are in here somewhere.
I don't know where Jeff put them.

791
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:08,304
I need to look everywhere, okay.
I'm going to check all the stairs.

792
01:14:08,697 --> 01:14:12,062
Look, Sam here, you can ...
I'm gonna check the kitchen, okay?

793
01:14:33,297 --> 01:14:35,840
Where are all the phones, Jeff?

794
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,834
Got the maps,
did you find the phones?

795
01:14:48,835 --> 01:14:51,367
They're not in any, Kate.  We looked
everywhere.  What's in that room?

796
01:14:51,493 --> 01:14:54,115
That room's have been fucking
locked since we got here, Tim!

797
01:14:54,227 --> 01:14:54,927
They are here.

798
01:14:54,928 --> 01:14:57,531
I know they're in because Jeff put
them in a bag and hid them somewhere.

799
01:14:57,532 --> 01:14:58,780
Now we're not looking properly.

800
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:01,965
- Did you try the dining room?
- Just long in that.

801
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,737
Well, let's look again, shall we!
Fuck it!

802
01:15:10,897 --> 01:15:15,098
- I can't find anything!
- Kate!  We're scared!

803
01:15:15,433 --> 01:15:17,775
We can't be able to get
caught like the others, do we?

804
01:15:17,776 --> 01:15:21,978
I'm scared, Tim!
I'm scared, scared, scared!

805
01:15:22,113 --> 01:15:25,549
We need to phone the police, we
need to tell somebody that we're here.

806
01:15:25,684 --> 01:15:27,261
They're coming for us.
They've got guns.

807
01:15:27,362 --> 01:15:29,173
Otherwise, we're dead.
Do you understand?

808
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:32,465
Why don't we just go now?
Kate, please.  We've got the maps.

809
01:15:34,735 --> 01:15:37,179
Listen.  I'm going to
check outside in the barn.

810
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,464
You need to look at the
map and see where we are.

811
01:15:39,465 --> 01:15:41,797
I'll be back in a
second and join the family.

812
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:47,521
Good evening.

813
01:15:48,356 --> 01:15:50,915
I reckon my first blood lads.

814
01:15:54,357 --> 01:15:58,751
Yeah.  And it
will be fi fy if I go.

815
01:15:59,478 --> 01:16:03,544
Well, next we've got the north,
they said they want to go...

816
01:16:03,545 --> 01:16:06,253
Fi fy if I go.

817
01:16:07,474 --> 01:16:11,506
They pulled down father's checks,
and chopped off all his legs...

818
01:16:11,507 --> 01:16:14,547
Fi fy if I go.

819
01:16:15,508 --> 01:16:19,314
They took his dirty wife,
and buried her alive...

820
01:16:19,315 --> 01:16:22,079
Fi fy if I go.

821
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:27,387
They took all dirty kids,
and fed them to the pigs ...

822
01:16:27,388 --> 01:16:30,584
Fi fy if I go.

823
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:37,728
Shit!

824
01:16:37,763 --> 01:16:39,895
Kate, we need more bullets.

825
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:42,907
- Where are they?
- They're in there.

826
01:16:49,158 --> 01:16:51,361
Ron, we need
ammunition up here, now.

827
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:57,158
- Here you are, Jim.
- Swap with him.

828
01:16:57,391 --> 01:16:59,355
Rats, with me, now.

829
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:04,850
- Alright go on.
- What?

830
01:17:05,703 --> 01:17:09,558
- I'll get you half a dozen pints in.
- Alright!

831
01:17:15,367 --> 01:17:16,926
Go on, lad.

832
01:17:22,946 --> 01:17:28,091
- Oh!  That looks painful.
- No, please.

833
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,678
Fuck you!

834
01:17:39,856 --> 01:17:41,048
Blasted!

835
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:47,807
Jim, help me.

836
01:17:49,016 --> 01:17:50,110
Let if out.

837
01:17:50,745 --> 01:17:55,034
You got us by our knockers.
What are you gonna do now, eh?

838
01:17:55,537 --> 01:18:01,357
There's a lot of us.  For miles around.
Not many of you, not around here.

839
01:18:01,492 --> 01:18:05,011
You won't make a blime if you
ever give a pull that trigger.

840
01:18:05,146 --> 01:18:09,034
He won't miss him if you blow him off.
Quiet dope.

841
01:18:09,669 --> 01:18:13,392
Why waste your rounds
on tittlers like him?

842
01:18:13,427 --> 01:18:17,756
When you could be bugging where
have him beauties like me, eh?

843
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,887
That's good.
I need you to stay still, Sam.

844
01:18:27,981 --> 01:18:29,955
Be still, be still.

845
01:18:35,431 --> 01:18:39,795
- It's gonna be alright.  Come on.
- How many more?

846
01:18:39,797 --> 01:18:40,928
Keep one.

847
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:49,598
That's it!
That's all.

848
01:18:52,034 --> 01:18:54,757
- Thank you.
- That's alright.

849
01:19:14,532 --> 01:19:15,929
You're okay.

850
01:19:19,786 --> 01:19:21,270
It's okay.
It's alright.

851
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:23,205
I know.

852
01:19:28,993 --> 01:19:34,123
- Look after him.  What a way to go.
- I'll bet.

853
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:41,186
Poor old Rats.  Quickest too short
lungs suffered down in records.

854
01:19:42,332 --> 01:19:48,403
Hey!  Come on, you dirty bastards!
Come on!

855
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:57,836
- 5 along 40 yards.
- Come on!

856
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,681
10 on 50.

857
01:20:04,072 --> 01:20:07,926
- Right, play on.
- Come on, you fuckers!

858
01:20:08,648 --> 01:20:09,989
Come on!

859
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,303
Come on.

860
01:20:19,964 --> 01:20:22,780
Oh fuck!
Fuck!

861
01:20:22,789 --> 01:20:27,865
Well, you jummy bastard.  1 leg
another 15 yards.  Double or nought.

862
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,204
- 1 leg?
- Right.

863
01:20:34,222 --> 01:20:38,327
- You, are you alright, are you?
- Oh yeah Podge, it's that last break.

864
01:20:40,162 --> 01:20:45,733
- What if she loses?
- Leg.  Only one mine.

865
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:51,929
Let's get it over.
Come on.

866
01:21:01,968 --> 01:21:03,966
It's alright.

867
01:21:05,049 --> 01:21:06,137
You're okay.

868
01:21:24,781 --> 01:21:28,191
No!  Stop!
Fuck!

869
01:21:33,453 --> 01:21:35,123
Glad you're on, Podge.

870
01:21:48,448 --> 01:21:53,111
- You might know what I told ya.
- Yeah, she's proper feisty that one.

871
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:59,399
There she goes.
Come on, lass.

872
01:22:04,406 --> 01:22:07,342
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.

873
01:22:11,861 --> 01:22:13,369
I'm leaving with a
golden bullet left here.

874
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:17,192
I'm going to try that other room.

875
01:22:17,493 --> 01:22:21,603
Stay and keep watch, okay.
It's going to be alright.

876
01:22:23,197 --> 01:22:24,222
Tim.

877
01:22:47,311 --> 01:22:51,680
Sam!  There is a staircase down
here, leading down to the cellar.

878
01:22:51,684 --> 01:22:55,372
But I'm going to check it out alright.
Stay there and keep watch.

879
01:23:17,783 --> 01:23:23,970
Dear Lord, who art
in heaven, and hell.

880
01:23:24,174 --> 01:23:26,022
You had their momma worried.

881
01:23:26,023 --> 01:23:31,752
He was right little shit hole, man bull.
Deep down he was a good man.

882
01:23:32,566 --> 01:23:34,262
Loved his greens.

883
01:23:34,818 --> 01:23:36,403
All they said these vegetables.

884
01:23:36,404 --> 01:23:43,035
You remember the day .... cheesenuts.
Being bowl of broccoli no butter ...

885
01:23:44,429 --> 01:23:46,454
You are my son.

886
01:23:54,107 --> 01:23:57,035
Amen.

887
01:24:03,851 --> 01:24:04,871
Tim!

888
01:24:19,843 --> 01:24:22,307
Sam.  There's answers.

889
01:24:22,508 --> 01:24:25,159
These fucking galleys are booze and vodka.

890
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,847
Look, the point I'm getting at is,
I'll call store.dot.lights.

891
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:36,666
It's the fire exits.
I got privity here.

892
01:24:41,957 --> 01:24:44,095
Look.  We don't want
any more trouble okay?

893
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,995
Nor I.  Prove it.

894
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:52,734
Well.

895
01:24:56,339 --> 01:24:57,368
Greg, come over here.

896
01:24:58,492 --> 01:25:00,155
You all right?
I'm pretty good.

897
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:08,042
Well?

898
01:25:10,724 --> 01:25:12,062
It's safe, Jim.

899
01:25:25,494 --> 01:25:31,118
- You found it.
- Away, lads.  It'll be alright.

900
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:35,296
They are down here.
Greg, on with you.

901
01:26:11,865 --> 01:26:14,791
What the bloody hell has
been going on down here?

902
01:26:14,792 --> 01:26:17,667
Stay there.  No closer.

903
01:26:18,498 --> 01:26:20,661
Don't you dare fucking move!

904
01:26:21,086 --> 01:26:25,473
Careful, son.  A lot of broken
glass.  You'll cut yourself.

905
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:27,424
Put your weapons down.

906
01:26:27,825 --> 01:26:31,132
Been having a bit of a
shindig down here, don't ya?

907
01:26:31,762 --> 01:26:35,103
Not me.
The party just beginning.

908
01:26:35,722 --> 01:26:37,622
Now put your weapons down.

909
01:26:41,055 --> 01:26:45,665
Podge, put it down.
Put it down.

910
01:26:49,312 --> 01:26:53,873
I know what you all are thinking.
Would I kill myself?

911
01:26:54,521 --> 01:26:58,461
I don't know.
Would you?

912
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:00,102
You know how they gamble?

913
01:27:00,303 --> 01:27:04,663
Well, we lost a
little bit shape lately.

914
01:27:05,282 --> 01:27:09,298
Yeah?  But its about to
get more fucking worse.

915
01:27:09,872 --> 01:27:11,991
Time to turn on the heat.

916
01:27:16,483 --> 01:27:21,391
- Oh fuck!
- You're cold lad?

917
01:27:21,407 --> 01:27:24,558
I don't understand me.
Alcohol should burn.

918
01:27:25,255 --> 01:27:29,730
No. No, no.  That's
watered down piss, lad.

919
01:27:29,842 --> 01:27:33,437
Wouldn't give it to me
missus, God rest her soul.

920
01:27:33,556 --> 01:27:37,204
We make a good brew bucket
in the mill up there.  Ain't it a treat.

921
01:27:37,305 --> 01:27:39,572
Fuck!
Come on!

922
01:27:40,248 --> 01:27:41,788
Get on, Podge.

923
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:46,026
Come on son, let's
get this sorted out.

924
01:27:54,437 --> 01:27:57,619
Fuck you!
Fuck you, cunt!

925
01:27:58,682 --> 01:28:03,343
Fucker!
No!  No!

926
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:22,081
No!  Please!

927
01:28:27,673 --> 01:28:32,491
- What are the odds?
- The trap's favourite.  Evens.

928
01:28:32,526 --> 01:28:36,196
Pit 3 to 1.
Tripwire, 7 to 1.

929
01:28:36,304 --> 01:28:40,518
My mine's outsider.
15 to 1.

930
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,755
- 10 on land mine.
- You throwing it away again, Jim.

931
01:29:22,513 --> 01:29:25,253
No!  No!

932
01:29:26,013 --> 01:29:27,344
Fucking bugger.

933
01:29:27,345 --> 01:29:30,010
About the time me luck changed.

934
01:29:33,069 --> 01:29:37,113
- Oh well.  A pint?
- Alright!

935
01:29:56,865 --> 01:30:00,324
<i>Let me tell thee all,
the fate that did befall...</i>

936
01:30:00,325 --> 01:30:03,081
<i>Fi fy fi fy go.</i>

937
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:08,469
<i>When outsiders came
and tried to stake a claim ...</i>

938
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:12,090
<i>Fi fy fi fy go.</i>

Shirono is the killer.

Look, this is her.

Miki Shirono.

You could say...

00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,851
she's rather plain looking.

Yeah, she is plain.

224
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:03,920
Right.

225
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,925
Shirono joined the company
when Noriko did...

226
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,426
Hold on!

227
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,325
Who's Mi-chan?!

228
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,425
Everybody is named 'Mi...'!

229
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,829
That's true...

230
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:19,133
Mi-chan joined when I did,
real name is Emi Mitsushima.

231
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,833
It's like this,

232
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:26,211
Noriko's family name is 'Miki',
meaning '3 trees',

233
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,171
Noriko Miki.

234
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,675
'Miki' Shirono...

235
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,283
means 'beautiful'...

236
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,892
'princess in the castle'.

237
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,129
<i>But actually,</i>

238
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:51,363
<i>Noriko Miki was really the
'beautiful princess in the castle'.</i>

239
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,694
<i>Yeah.</i>

240
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,540
Hired together,
they were compared.

241
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,701
Probably that upset Shirono.

242
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,879
<i>When visitors came,
their boss would...</i>

243
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,140
Shirono, prepare tea.

244
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,182
Noriko, please serve it.

245
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,846
<i>He should have told
Noriko to prepare and serve!</i>

246
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:11,715
What's more,

247
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:16,056
Mi-chan says Shirono dated
Section Head Shinoyama.

248
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:29,105
<i>But they stopped dating
just after spring.</i>

249
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,603
<i>It was because of Noriko.</i>

250
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,472
<i>So, to Shirono,</i>

251
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,708
<i>her boyfriend was stolen by Noriko.</i>

252
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,113
<i>Shirono was seen
glaring at Noriko,</i>

253
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:43,915
<i>by Mi-chan.</i>

254
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,684
So the motive was jealousy?

255
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,928
But...

256
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,101
Shirono didn't seem to feel that,
treating Noriko the same afterwards.

257
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,862
I also had trouble with Shirono,

258
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:04,100
<i>I dropped the mug
that she treasured.</i>

259
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,102
<i>Mug?</i>

260
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:12,412
<i>It had a big 'S' on it,
maybe that stood for Shinoyama.</i>

261
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,247
<i>Satoshi Shinoyama.</i>

262
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,891
<i>You should have seen her face!</i>

263
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,886
Repressed feelings...

264
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,291
might make someone
snap from stress...

265
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,292
on the murder night.

266
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,929
<i>That evening,</i>

267

269
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,411

285
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,542

286
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,078

287
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,247
Good night.

288
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,243
She should have been more grateful.

289
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:57,722
Shirono was your partner,
so owes you the most.

290
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,258
She's just that kind of person.

291
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,021
Let's go!

292
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,346

300
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,534
Something?
When did she take them?

301
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,510
Then our colleague
saw Shirono...

302
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,845
<i>run into the train station,
and take a Tokyo express.</i>

303
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,646

305
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,651

306

307
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,328

00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:54,031

310
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,472

to be honest,

314
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,890
it might be best if she did it.

315
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:18,855
If it was a stalker or some
unknown man that killed her,

316
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,331
I'd be afraid to go out,

00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,624
How did it all begin?

348
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,329
There's someone I like,
please tell me how to begin an affair.

349
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,777
How about preparing him lunch?

350
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,674
Try it for 3 days.

351
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,751
Didn't I sound just like her?!

352
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,253
Yeah, I suppose...

353
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:28,155
<i>From what I've seen,
I think Noriko didn't date Shinoyama.</i>

354
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,525
<i>Maybe Shinoyama liked her,
or just had a delusion.</i>

355
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:37,164
<i>But Shirono did begin to
break down from that time.</i>

356
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,169
I can't compete with Noriko.

357
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,809
If someone stole your lover,
would you stab and burn them?

358
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:59,188
Well, normal people wouldn't.

359
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,860
Shirono is not normal.

360
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,991
<i>Last summer,</i>

361
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:11,067
<i>our section held a social charity
BBQ in Shigure Valley.</i>

362
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:16,403
<i>A s organizers,
Shirono and I went ahead to set up.</i>

363
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,558
Cops will catch you!

364
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,993
Don't worry.

365
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,598
I know where the speed traps are.

366
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,366
<i>She chuckled,</i>

367
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,994
with a weird grin.

368
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,999
Her face really
did not look normal then.

369
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,710
Did anybody see Noriko's pen?

370
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,904
<i>I heard about that theft.</i>

371
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,447
I just saw it here...

372
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:00,412
<i>Noriko's pen was stolen.</i>

373
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,112
<i>It's worth about 5, 000yen!</i>

374
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:07,751
<i>It was produced for a minor
violinist that she liked.</i>

375
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,052
Serizawa Family?

376
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,719
Serizawa Brothers.

377
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:15,095
Amazing!
TV people know everything!

378
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,067
That group seldom has concerts.

379
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,131
That's right...

380
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,108
You didn't put it somewhere else?

381
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:26,937
No...

382
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,780
<i>Shirono had a weirdgrin
at that time also.</i>

383
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,112
<i>It was the day before the murder.</i>

384
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,253
Are you alright?

385
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,824
I may have a fever.

386
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,130
You don't have to stay.

387
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,300
No, I owe a lot to you, Mayama.

388
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,296
You're that kind of person.

389
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,837
Only you'd say such kind words.

390
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,463
Not at all.

391
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,951

00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,616
It's OK, I'll walk home.

Your pen...

394
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,325
I have to return it.

395
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:20,833
Huh?

396
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:28,537
<i>She stole the pen so
she could get Noriko into her car.</i>

397
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,837
<i>And to steal the pen,</i>

398
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,379
<i>she had previously
stolen other things.</i>

399
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:41,146
It was all part of a
carefully planned murder plot.

400
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,729

It seems female staff

410

It seems that you were dating Shirono?

411
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,989
That's not true,
we weren't dating.

412
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,587
<i>Last fall,

Sorry.

419
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,949
I felt dizzy.

420
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,922
Lack of nutrition...

421
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:03,596
Can I bring you
a box lunch tomorrow?

422
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,761
No, please don't bother.

423
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,673
My parents sent so many vegetables,
I can't eat them all.

424
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,504
You'd be doing me a favor.

425
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,025
As if we're lovers...

426
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,189
Because you need nutrients...

427
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:37,532
Well, at least let me
pay for the ingredients.

428
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,064
No thanks,

429
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:44,502
then I would be under pressure
to make a proper lunch.

430
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,678
I'll bring one tomorrow.

431
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,825
I have to say no,
I really have to.

432
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:31,381
<i>How is your health?
You need nutrition on the weekend, too.</i>

433
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,922
This is scary...

434
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,860
I just dropped it off while shopping.

435
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,004

436
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,231
Not at all.

437
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:54,106
Actually,
I have a girlfriend now.

438
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,445
So no more box lunches...

439
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:00,912

440
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,880

I didn't lie!
I was dating Noriko.

450
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,171
She came after me.

451
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:58,001
But it ended after about 3 months.

452
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,839
She said that she met someone else...
It happens a lot.

453
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,854

Only the victim
had an expensive item stolen?

605

That's correct.

606
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:21,410
The pen was rare,
produced for a violinist she liked.

607
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:24,572
So there was hostility between them?

608

No, not particularly.

609
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,476
Just asking, but...

610
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:34,820
could she pick up the victim by 08:00 PM,
drive to the scene of the crime,

611
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,157
stab her and set fire to her,

612
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:42,666
and then arrive in time for
the express train at 09:10 PM?

613
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,469
Is that schedule possible?

614

- that 'Ms S' is the criminal...
- It's just a theory.

624

690
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,887
<i>I'll begin by stating that
this is a letter of protest.</i>

691
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:40,891
<i>Since college,
I have been a close friend of...</i>

692
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:46,662
<i>Miki Shirono, identified as
suspect 'Ms S' in last week's TV news.</i>

693
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:51,100
<i>We lived in the same
dormitory in college.</i>

694
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:53,570
What do you mean, 'do it'?

695
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,446
'Do it' means 'do it'!

696
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,250
Did you 'do it'?

697
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,283
I don't understand...

698
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,487
I mean...

699
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:10,585
Had sex?

700
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:19,258
Is it OK to do that before marriage?

701
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:29,605
<i>We nicknamed Shirono "En-chan",
for 'endangered species'.</i>

702
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,773
<i>She loved "Anne of Green Gables".</i>

703
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:39,121
<i>She's a good cook,
so if we had to work late,</i>

704
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:44,954
<i>she'd prepare little meals
to leave in our lockers.</i>

705
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,831
<i>Such a kind person couldn't kill.</i>

706
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:48,799
<i>Sweetie Food Service!
Such a kind person couldn't kill.</i>

707
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:49,323
<i>Sweetie Food Service!</i>

708
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,468
<i>I support my good friend,
En-chan.</i>

709
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,807
<i>That news report is all wrong.</i>

710
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,808
<i>I don't trust the source.</i>

711
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,812
<i>... but only the chestnut remained.</i>

712
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,780
<i>En-chan loves chestnuts.</i>

713
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,112
<i>... but I don't recall dating her.</i>

714
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:13,387
<i>This guy is the biggest liar.</i>

715
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,150
<i>I met him before.</i>

716
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,789
<i>He is Shinoyama, right?</i>

717
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,791
<i>A real nuisance.</i>

718
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:24,231
<i>I met with En-chan last winter.</i>

719
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,859
Welcome!

720
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,004
Oh!

721
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,161
See you.

722
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,341
Bye.

723
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:31,271
Excuse me.

724
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,277
<i>You like him.</i>

725
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,585
Why not tell him?

726
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:49,554
I think he wouldn't
be interested in me.

727
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,460
You're a good cook,

728
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,034
so why not prepare him lunch?
Try it for 3 days.

729
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,770
<i>That's what I advised.</i>

730
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,801
Dating him?!

731
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,040
Yeah.

732
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,646
The result of your advice.

733
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:16,878
<i>She had a great smile when happy,
we called it the 'En-chan Smile'.</i>

734
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:21,347
<i>I'm sure she had that smile
when she told me,</i>

735
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,991
<i>so I felt really good.</i>

736
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:30,798
<i>She said Shinoyama
was grateful for the lunches.</i>

737
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:34,069
<i>He likes beef and eggplant,</i>

738
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:38,633
<i>but dislikes smelt and tomatoes.</i>

739
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,411
Would you mind?

740
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:42,768
<i>She said that...</i>

741
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,476
<i>they did it...</i>

742
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:59,319
<i>And he liked to be licked
between the 3rd and 4th toes.</i>

743
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,664
<i>She told me such things by phone.</i>

744
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,831
<i>Would I make up these stories?</i>

745
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:10,768
<i>Since then,
her whereabouts is unknown.</i>

746
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:15,267
<i>That is what worries me most.</i>

747
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:19,380
<i>A ware of my sensitive skin,</i>

748
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:26,283
<i>En-chan often kindly sent me
hard to get Snow White soap.</i>

749
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:32,029
<i>If somehow she did
get involved in a murder,</i>

750
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,628
<i>she might commit suicide from guilt.</i>

751
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,031
<i>Even as the criminal,</i>

752
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,138
<i>please locate her quickly.</i>

753
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,498
<i>Bring her back to me.</i>

754
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:48,977
<i>She is my dear friend.</i>

755
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,988
You tweeted on the Internet,
you idiot!

756
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,251
No, I didn't do that.

757
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,725
Of course not.

758
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:08,194
Don't get carried away.
You'll be fired!

759
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,697
I know. I'm sorry.

760
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,396
I'm sorry.

761
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:26,714
<i>NORI-MI: My friend Miki Shirono
was suspected of the murder.</i>

762
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,914
<i>Sent a protest letter to TVprogram.</i>

763

and distorted voices?

777
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:27,900
That's great!

778
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,570
You asked about Miki Shirono?

779
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,542
What she's like?

780
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:33,649
Here's our yearbook.

781
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,740
Brought that?!

782
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,719
- Future stuff...
- Brings back memories.

783
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,315
"Person Most Likely to Commit Crime".

784
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:42,748
She's 2nd.

785
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:43,485
No way!

786
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:44,993
Miki Shirono.

787
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,621
Look here.

788
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,333
"Will good things..."

789
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:54,560
"happen in college?"
Miki Shirono.

790
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:58,831
Seems that good things
didn't happen in college.

791
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,202
She was in my group
in cooking class.

792
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:05,711
She'd chop off fish heads...

793
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,250
That's scary!

794
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:10,081
She was amazing.
And meat fiber...

795
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,920
She really knew
how to carve meat.

796
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,687
- She knew?
- Yeah!

797
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,759
In Junior High School,

798
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:22,097
she was known as...

799
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,726
'Curse Shirono'.

800
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:27,426
The soccer team captain
was really good,

801
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:31,269
he could become
a top local soccer player.

802
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:35,903
He was fooling around one day,
like school kids do,

803
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,948
and he kicked a rag as...

804
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:42,143
the classroom was being cleaned,

805
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:43,947
and just by accident...

806
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:47,455
the rag landed on Shirono's head.

807
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:53,661
About one week later,
that skilled soccer player,

808
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:57,131
broke his leg
in a car accident.

809
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,131
Car came from the side,

810
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:04,636
I slammed on the brakes,
but they failed and I got hit.

811
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,773
My leg was hit hard.

812
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,470
It was strangely twisted.

813
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:10,413
<i>Shingo Eto</i>

814
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,648

It took 3 months to heal.

818
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,419
They told you it was a curse?

819
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:21,156
Such people are disgusting.

820
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:28,159
There was no curse,
brakes were disconnected.

821
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:33,331
But I think Shirono...
disconnected them.

822
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:38,939
The entire body...

823
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:44,013
had been stabbed dozens of times,
and then burned?

824
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,516
Trigger may have been...

825
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,518
because of me.

826
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:58,020
The rag I kicked
landed on her head,

827
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,723
her face went totally red,

828
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,396
must have felt insulted.

829
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:08,033
To be honest,
I really regret it.

830
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:13,038
It must be about 14 years ago.

831
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,212
At the Myojin Shrine over there...
See it?

837
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:25,020

838
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,886
Can you see it?
Inside there is...

839
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,926
the shrine to the Myojin deity.

840
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:34,031
That place caught fire.

841
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:38,726
Maybe just a rumor,
but probably true,

842
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:41,895
that little Miki started the fire.

843
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:47,042
It wasn't arson or playing with fire,

844
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,403
anyway...

845
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,242
I heard it was the Curse Ritual.

846
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:56,217
In Primary school,
Yuko and Miki would go together,

847
00:55:56,353 --> 00:56:02,088
and my daughter said that
they'd have a Curse Ritual ceremony.

848
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,720
Probably Yuko is in her house now.
Actually...

849
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,594
Yuko never leaves her house,
she's always there,

850
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,932
she's a recluse.

Talk about the Curse Ritual is true.

854
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:19,599
We did it.
Talk about the Curse Ritual is true.

855
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,276
We made a human-shaped cutout,

856
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,438
shoved a pin through it,

857
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,448
and set fire to it.

858
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,786

That's Miki Shirono.

862
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,323

870
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:36,845
Anne thought of making
paper figures to burn.

00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:45,442

I didn't hear until later,

922

but our parents argued about
who'd set the fire,

923
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:30,470
both sides decided their kids
would never meet again.

In the book, Diana was
Anne's only friend.

1036
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:26,469
<i>Primary School Classmate
of 'Ms S'
It seems rather strange to put a pin...</i>

1037
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:27,232
<i>It seems rather strange to put a pin...</i>

1038
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:31,170
<i>through a human
figure and set fire to it.</i>

1039
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:32,842
<i>Neighbor of 'Ms S'</i>

1040
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:38,514
<i>Neighbor of 'Ms S'
Wasn't that recent murder
similar to the Curse Ritual?</i>

1041
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:39,014
<i>Neighbor of 'Ms S'</i>

1042
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:40,850
<i>Neighbor of 'Ms S'

1043
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:41,050
<i>Our reporter interviewed...</i>

<i>Family Home of 'Ms S'

1045
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:41,484
<i>Family Home of 'Ms S'</i>

1046
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,851
<i>Family Home of 'Ms S'
the parents of 'Ms S'.</i>

1047
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,012
<i>We are so sorry!</i>

1048
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,824
<i>Parents of 'Ms S'</i>

1049
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,527
<i>Parents of 'Ms S'
Please try to...</i>

1050
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:51,660
<i>Parents of 'Ms S'</i>

1051
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,863
<i>Parents of 'Ms S'
forgive our daughter!</i>

1052
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:54,922
<i>Parents of 'Ms S'</i>

1053
01:08:56,165 --> 01:09:00,364
<i>The missing 'Ms S'
is the only one who knows.</i>

1054
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:05,373
<i>We can only pray that
the case will be solved quickly.</i>

1055
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,205
Well, now it involves the occult.

1056
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:16,547
Perhaps childhood memories
had a significant role...

1057
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:19,545
at the time of the murder.

1058
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:23,523
<i>Killed during a flashback
of the Curse Ritual?</i>

1059
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:26,856
<i>Such cases have occurred.</i>

1060
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:32,491
<i>But 'Ms S' may not
actually be the murderer...</i>

1061
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,036
<i>Her age during the Curse Ritual?</i>

1062
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,573
<i>She was 11 years old,
Primary school Grade 6.</i>

1063
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,069
<i>I don't know...</i>

1064
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,569
<i>myself anymore.</i>

1065
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:45,381
<i>She always felt victimized
and heldgrudges.</i>

1066
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,316
<i>Shirono lives at 221-12...
She always felt victimized
and heldgrudges.</i>

1067
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:50,912
<i>Kill Snow White.</i>

1068
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,788
<i>Miki Shirono colleagues.</i>

1069
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:53,915
<i>Miki Shirono colleagues.
Is this...</i>

1070
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:54,657
<i>Miki Shirono.</i>

1071
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:57,760
<i>Miki Shirono.
Miki Shirono?</i>

1072
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,750
<i>Miki Shirono.</i>

1073
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:03,926
<i>If I could,</i>

1074
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,760
<i>I'd return to that night,</i>

1075
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,936
<i>and change it.</i>

1076
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,581
<i>I will...</i>

1077
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:26,613
<i>try to write about myself.</i>

1078
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,781
<i>Not too late,</i>

1079
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,820
<i>to leave here after that.</i>

1080
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,399
<i>Miki Shirono</i>

1081
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:42,736
<i>Miki Shirono
To Whom It May Concern</i>

1082
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:53,939
<i>Nagasawa is a typical rural town,
surrounded by mountains.</i>

1083
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,315
<i>That's my home town.</i>

1084
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:02,986
<i>In Primary school,
my best friend was Yuko Tanimura.</i>

1085
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,989
Yuko, let's go to school.

1086
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,990
<i>The prettiest girl in town.</i>

1087
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:15,162
<i>But she was bullied,
and always looked sullen.</i>

1088
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:18,833
<i>Akane Yatsuka was to blame.</i>

1089
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:22,502
Akane, you're so pretty.
You're lucky.

1090
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,511
I'm just average.

1091
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,476
Yuko is more pretty.

1092
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,847
Yeah, Yuko is also pretty.

1093
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:34,355
<i>Those few words by someone
changed everything.</i>

1094
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,187
<i>Akane had such a cute face.</i>

1095
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,122
<i>If Akane hadn't put others down,</i>

1096
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:48,536
<i>she would have
received lots of compliments.</i>

1097
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,531
<i>In that respect,</i>

1098
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:55,376
<i>she was just like Noriko Miki.</i>

1099
01:11:57,513 --> 01:12:01,211
<i>Ms Higashiyama was our
Grade 6 teacher.</i>

1100
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,182
Taichi Suzuki.

1101
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,378
Here!

1102
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:06,378
Oh dear,

1103
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,450
a strong name,
but a weakling.

1104
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:17,197
<i>Until Taichi graduated
Senior High and left town,</i>

1105
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,902
<i>he was called 'Weakling'.</i>

1106
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:22,662
Next,

1107
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:24,865
Miki Shirono.

1108
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:30,042
Let's see the
'beautiful princess in the castle'.

1109
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,704
Here.

1110
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,350
Too bad,
wrong name for you.

1111
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:46,219
Yuko Tanimura.

1112
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,295
Here.

1113
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:49,888
Next...

1114
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,561
Teacher...

1115
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,194
Call her 'Octopus'.

1116
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,074
Octopus, nice to meet you.

1117
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,241
Octopus!

1118
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:14,422
Oh my, you turned purple,
like an octopus!

1119
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:15,747
Octopus!

1120
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,751
I hate my name.

1121
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,756
Not just you,
I'm 'beautiful princess...'

1122
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:26,834
Akane didn't have to
tell the teacher.

1123
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:29,168
Don't cry, Yuko.

1124
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,771
When you feel bad...

1125
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:37,507
<i>When you feel bad,
go into a fantasy world.</i>

1126
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,615
<i>Like "Anne of Green Gables" did.</i>

1127
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:52,626
<i>We made up names
for our fantasy world.</i>

1128
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,628
<i>Best Friend Alley.</i>

1129
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,299
<i>Sleeping Fairy Mountain.</i>

1130
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,466
<i>Knock-knock Road.</i>

1131
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,306
<i>Stardust Lake.</i>

1132
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:13,375
See, bad things disappear
in a fantasy world, Diana.

1133
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,050
Anne...

1134
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,985
But shy to be 'Diana'.

1135
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:26,827
No,

1136
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,489
from now on we'll say
'Anne' and 'Diana'.

1137
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:37,537
I'm here.

1138
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:40,668
I'm here for you, Diana.

1139
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:48,584
<i>Akane Yatsuka</i>

1140
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,352
<i>Akane Yatsuka</i>
Even after we grow up,

1141
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:50,652
<i>Akane Yatsuka</i>

1142
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:51,186
<i>Akane Yatsuka</i>
will she be like that?

1143
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:52,245
will she be like that?

1144
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,514
In the end,

1145
01:14:55,991 --> 01:15:00,019
will girls like Akane always win?

1146
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,693
There will...

1147
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,203
be some.

1148
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,436
Huh?

1149
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,197
After we grow up,

1150
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:16,544
good things...

1151
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,890
<i>My first love was in Junior High.</i>

1152
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:36,390
Give it a try?

1153
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:47,075
Wow! Great shot!

1154
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:01,255
I'm sorry.

1155
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,586
I hate you!

1156
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:10,755
I won't forgive you!

1157
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:16,605
<i>It was like them.</i>

1158
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,437
<i>Anne and Gilbert.</i>

1159
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:24,442
<i>Anne wouldn't easily forgive him.</i>

1160
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:29,514
<i>But that led to them
being interested in each other.</i>

1161
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:31,450
Sorry about that.

1162
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,453
I'll never forgive you.

1163
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,619
I'm sorry.

1164
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:38,452
Not forgiven!

1165
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,961
<i>I didn't let him off the hook,</i>

1166
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:46,365
<i>so he'd come to me daily,
saying he was sorry.</i>

1167
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,538
I guess there's no choice,
it's OK.

1168
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,304
I forgive you.

1169
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,806
<i>One week later,</i>

1170
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,973
<i>on the day I was
going to say it was OK...</i>

1171
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:58,477
He had an accident.

1172
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:09,881
A car hit his bike,
his broken leg needs 3 months to heal.

1173
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:16,995
On his way home from
practice yesterday,

1174
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:19,825
perhaps speed was a factor...

1175
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:33,913
Why'd you come?

1176
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:38,246
I have the right to be here.

1177
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,083
Because...

1178
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,352
I haven't told you yet,

1179
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,251
that I forgive you.

1180
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,186
Thank you.

1181
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:52,199
Even if everyone
is against you,

1182
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:54,696
I'll be on your side.

1183
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:04,546
<i>During that happy daydream,</i>

1184
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,207
<i>I'm sure I was smiling.</i>

1185
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,353
<i>Even so,</i>

1186
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,860
<i>Will good things happen in college?
Miki Shirono
I kept believing...</i>

1187
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,461
<i>Will good things happen in college?
Miki Shirono</i>

1188
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,521
<i>Will good things happen in college?
Miki Shirono
good things would happen.</i>

1189
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,202
<i>Minori Maetani was my best friend.</i>

1190
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:32,202
I see...

1191
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:34,367
You're dating him.

1192
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:38,443
So,

1193
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,276
did you do it?

1194
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:41,875
Do 'it'?

1195
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:44,111
<i>I mean...</i>

1196
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:46,045
Had sex?

1197
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,723
I don't want to...

1198
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,893
talk about such things.

1199
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:58,790
Amazing...
you did it first.

1200
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:01,463
Unbelievable!

1201
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:03,630
Huh?

1202
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:06,407
En-chan, tell me about it.

1203
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:09,171
<i>Tell me, I'm your best friend.</i>

1204
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:10,969
<i>She was...</i>

1205
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:12,474
<i>my best friend.</i>

1206
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:17,478
<i>But then,</i>

1207
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:20,820
<i>I met Noriko Miki.</i>

1208
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:26,826
I'll work hard
to learn my job quickly.

1209
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:28,828
I'll do my best.

1210
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:36,831
I'm Noriko Miki.

1211
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:42,334
I can't beat Shirono's name,
'beautiful princess of the castle',

1212
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:48,673
but I'll work hard to be
as good at my job.

1213
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,692
Shirono, prepare tea!

1214
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:10,534
Noriko, please serve it
to the visitors.

1215
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:11,874
Yes.

1216
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:18,540
You're so fashionable, Mayama.

1217
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:22,878
Not at all.
I just buy at a few shops I like.

1218
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:27,553
Good morning.

1219
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,016
Morning.

1220
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,392
You like it?
I just bought it.

1221
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:38,559
Morning.

1222
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:44,234
<i>I'm sure she intentionally
bought the same outfit.</i>

1223
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:48,240
<i>Mayama didn't...</i>

1224
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:51,876
<i>wear hers to work again.</i>

1225
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:00,915
This looks good.

1226
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:04,090
Don't start it like that,
Shinoyama!

1227
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:09,763
<i>I'm sure it was from that time that...</i>

1228
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:14,102
<i>Noriko started checking up on me.</i>

1229
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:21,539
She's gorgeous.
Most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

1230
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:22,770
Same here.

1231
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,105
Number one.

1232
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:28,943
How about you, Shirono?

1233
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:34,616
Well...

1234
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,790
The most beautiful one is...

1235
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,961
my childhood friend, Yuko.

1236
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,792
Who?! What's she like?

1237
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:45,957
Primary school classmate.

1238
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:50,303
Beautiful black hair,
fair complexion.

1239
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:53,965
Like the "Snow White" princess.

1240
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,982
Ouch!

1241
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,319
Are you alright?

1242
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:13,652
Sorry. I felt dizzy.

1243
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:16,491
Lack of nutrition...

1244
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:23,999
Can I bring you
a box lunch tomorrow?

1245
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:27,339
Really?!

1246
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:31,010
That would be great, thanks!
Thank you.

1247
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:44,682
<i>Perhaps...</i>

1248
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:47,021
Actually...

1249
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:51,693
No problem,
you don't like the taste...

1250
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:53,334
No, that's not it!

1251
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,035
The food was great.

1252
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:58,867
It was really good!

1253
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:01,699
If possible...

1254
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:06,877
I would be very grateful
if you'd bring lunch tomorrow.

1255
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:10,875
Of course.

1256
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,052
I'll bring lunch tomorrow.

1257
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:24,889
<i>I just dropped it off while shopping.</i>

1258
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:27,559
Sorry to bother you.

1259
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:31,570
Not at all.

1260
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:35,574
Why don't you...

1261
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:38,740
come inside for a while?

1262
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,586
Right there!

1263
01:23:56,431 --> 01:24:01,426
That's it, right there.
Between the 3rd and 4th toes.

1264
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,437
Did you play sports?

1265
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:08,944
Yeah.

1266
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,109
Soccer.

1267
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:24,950
<i>Even if everyone is against you,
I'll be on your side.</i>

1268
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:57,982
Let's go camping,
just the two of us.

1269
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,822
In Shigure Valley.

1270
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,157
Alright.

1271
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:14,832
Huh...?

1272
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:19,011
I can't accept any more
box lunches.

1273
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:23,507
Why not?

1274
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:26,844
My girlfriend...

1275
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:29,017
doesn't like it.

1276
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:32,519
Girlfriend?

1277
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:42,296
<i>In spite of that,
I still had one important thing.</i>

1278
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:50,969
<i>The Serizawa Brothers.</i>

1279
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:55,468
<i>The sound of their violins
was heavenly.</i>

1280
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:59,304
<i>I chanced upon them
on a music site.</i>

1281
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:07,646
<i>They seldom had live concerts,
most people hadn't heard of them.</i>

1282
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:10,649
<i>The brothers were violinists.</i>

1283
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:13,822
<i>The younger one, Masaya,
who played viola,</i>

1284
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:19,332
<i>had eyes that reminded me of Diana,
prettiest girl in Nagasawa.</i>

1285
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:28,007
Good things happen.

1286
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:34,013
Good things happen.

1287
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:40,683
Good things happen.

1288
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:32,397
I'm sorry!

1289
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,753
I'm really sorry.

1290
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:54,155
<i>I think that Noriko Miki
probably realized it at that time.</i>

1291
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,930
Serizawa Brothers?!

1292
01:28:58,099 --> 01:28:58,896
Yeah.

1293
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:05,939
Who are they?
Sounds like a comedy duo.

1294
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:10,103
You fool, Mi-chan.
They're great musicians.

1295
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,936
You know them?

1296
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:14,104
No...

1297
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,610
Is that a Serizawa pen?

1298
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:22,956
They're popular,
even fan club members can't get these.

1299
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:26,790
<i>Although dumped by Shinoyama,</i>

1300
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:33,093
<i>I acted as if nothing happened,
but she was upset.</i>

1301
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:35,830
<i>Serizawa Brothers FAN SI TE</i>

1302
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:42,334
<i>Masaya and a woman?!</i>

1303
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,778
<i>No! A fan?
I won't forgive her.</i>

1304
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:47,338
<i>I'm shocked!
I hope it's not true.</i>

1305
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:51,014
<i>She recently joined fan club,
Noriko Miki.</i>

1306
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:55,950
<i>It's true, we're dating.</i>

1307
01:29:56,657 --> 01:30:01,288
Record company friend of Dad
let me watch them recording.

1308
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:05,298
Masaya came over
and talked to me.

1309
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:08,801
And Shinoyama...?

1310
01:30:09,337 --> 01:30:10,464
Shinoyama?

1311
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:13,966
I never intended to date him.

1312
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:22,479
She took everything I had,
still not enough?

1313
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:06,021
<i>If I'd stopped liking
the Serizawa Brothers then,</i>

1314
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:09,521
<i>this may not have happened.</i>

1315
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:14,559
Did anybody see Noriko's pen?

1316
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:17,698
I just saw it here a minute ago.

1317
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:22,036
<i>That was the day before the murder.</i>

1318
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:23,700
Shirono,

1319
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:26,212
I want to talk to you.

1320
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:27,544
Huh?

1321
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:31,541
It wasn't me.

1322
01:31:32,386 --> 01:31:36,380
I would never steal
anything from anybody.

1323
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,557
No, it's not about the pen.

1324
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:43,390
I already know who took that.

1325
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:49,068
Also took "Snow White" soap,
I'll take action at some point.

1326
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:50,905
Eh?!

1327
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:52,737
Who took it?

1328
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:56,070
Our talk isn't about that.

1329
01:31:56,744 --> 01:32:01,580
There's a concert in Tokyo
tomorrow with the Serizawa Brothers.

1330
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:03,914
Yeah.

1331
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:09,247
Others groups will also play,
tickets are sold out.

1332
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:14,426
But they rarely perform live,
I really wanted a ticket.

1333
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:18,097
I have one ticket.

1334
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:22,260
Masaya gave it to me.

1335
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:25,764
But I have a cold,
so can't go to Tokyo.

1336
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:28,606
Can you go instead of me?

1337
01:32:29,577 --> 01:32:30,772
Front row seat.

1338
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:33,046
You sure?

1339
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:36,274
I'll bring it tomorrow.

1340
01:32:37,785 --> 01:32:38,775
Thank you!

1341
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:44,290
But tomorrow...

1342
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:48,292
What time do the
Serizawa Brothers appear?

1343
01:32:49,297 --> 01:32:51,129
At 11:30 PM.

1344
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:53,794
Found one!

1345
01:32:54,035 --> 01:32:57,301
You'll have to take
the 09:10 express train.

1346
01:32:58,005 --> 01:32:59,303
But Mayama, your...

1347
01:33:00,808 --> 01:33:02,800
Never give up, from now on.

1348
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:05,308
In every way.

1349
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:12,312
Good morning.

1350
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:15,156
Nice outfit.

1351
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:16,324
Thanks.

1352
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:20,488
I feel better now,
so I'm going.

1353
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:27,963
Masaya intended
for me to use that ticket,

1354
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:30,966
and would notice if I didn't go.

1355
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:36,339
But I already...

1356
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:40,171
bought an express ticket.

1357
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:42,676
I'll buy it from you.

1358
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:47,678
I'll bring you a souvenir.
Is a mug OK?

1359
01:33:49,223 --> 01:33:53,684
Risako broke the
Serizawa Brothers cup you had.

1360
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,207
Excuse me...

1361
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:21,714
Perhaps it's because of Noriko?

1362
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:23,889
Yeah...

1363
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:28,059
I thought so.

1364
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:35,067
To be honest,
I've had problems with her also.

1365
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:40,731
Feel free to confide in me
if you want.

1366
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:44,243
Shirono,

1367
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:48,239
let's go to that concert!

1368
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:51,918
Huh...?

1369
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:56,921
<i>Her plan was quite simple.</i>

1370
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:01,952
I have cold medicine.
It really works.

1371
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:03,928
Not poisoned?

1372
01:35:05,633 --> 01:35:06,794
Forget it...

1373
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:09,130
No, just joking.
I'll take it.

1374
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:13,269
I won't get drowsy?

1375
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:15,106
Not at all.

1376
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,436
Thanks.

1377
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:23,918
<i>It makes you really drowsy.
I'm usually OK, but get drowsy with it.</i>

1378
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:32,285
I may have a fever, after all.

1379
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:37,931
The best medicine is beer.
Drink up!

1380
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:41,092
<i>I'll also pour her lots of beer.</i>

1381
01:35:41,635 --> 01:35:45,265
<i>Noriko can't drink much,
so would sleep in a car.</i>

1382
01:35:45,806 --> 01:35:49,436
<i>When she does,
take the ticket from her bag and run.</i>

1383
01:35:58,119 --> 01:35:58,950
Chopstick?

1384
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:00,279
Excuse me!

1385
01:36:00,488 --> 01:36:01,751
Chopstick, please.

1386
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:08,293
Sorry, I have a cold,
will leave early.

1387
01:36:09,163 --> 01:36:11,792
I guess I won't see you again.

1388
01:36:13,968 --> 01:36:15,129
Goodbye.

1389
01:36:22,376 --> 01:36:24,311
I can't do it...

1390
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:28,476
<i>You were supposed to
go to the concert.</i>

1391
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:32,983
<i>Why just put up with things?
You always do.</i>

1392
01:36:36,824 --> 01:36:37,655
Hey...

1393
01:36:38,826 --> 01:36:39,987
I'll give you a lift.

1394
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:41,317
To the station.

1395
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:43,325
It's OK, I can walk.

1396
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:46,656
Also...

1397
01:36:47,368 --> 01:36:49,997
I didn't give you the express ticket.

1398
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:01,674
Somehow,

1399
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,676
drinking beer...

1400
01:37:06,086 --> 01:37:07,019
Yeah?

1401
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:10,681
Really woke me up.

1402
01:37:11,258 --> 01:37:13,022
I'd been feeling sleepy.

1403
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:16,854
Really?

1404
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:25,368
Thanks.

1405
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:27,199
Also, the ticket.

1406
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,490
No...!

1407
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,005
I forgot it!

1408
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:01,465
How could you?!
Ridiculous.

1409
01:38:01,642 --> 01:38:02,666
Sorry!

1410
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:05,780
There's enough time to get it.

1411
01:38:05,913 --> 01:38:07,814
I'll just buy a ticket.

1412
01:38:07,915 --> 01:38:09,383
Let me get out!

1413
01:38:16,257 --> 01:38:17,384
Be right back.

1414
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,057

<i>She ran away quickly.</i>

1441
01:43:13,787 --> 01:43:15,915

<i>Kano was initially arrested

Really?

1471
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,683
You should use it.

1472
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:02,513
Especially you.

1473
01:46:05,959 --> 01:46:08,986
Why did you take this soap?

1474
01:46:09,963 --> 01:46:11,226
Actually...

1475
01:46:12,065 --> 01:46:14,534
Worthless new employee!

01:46:14,968 --> 01:46:16,527
I'm sorry.

Boss, get mad at me, not her!

1478
01:46:21,908 --> 01:46:23,843

01:46:26,446 --> 01:46:28,711
- It was good.
- Thank you.

1480
01:46:30,984 --> 01:46:33,852
Thank you for always treating me.

1481
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:35,454
Treat me sometimes...

1482
01:46:38,658 --> 01:46:39,717
Today...

1483
01:46:40,594 --> 01:46:44,861
I received my bonus,
so please let me treat you.

1484
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:51,570
You don't need to treat me.

1485
01:46:52,005 --> 01:46:56,067
When you're a
new employee's partner,

1486
01:46:56,176 --> 01:46:58,407
treat her the same way.

1487
01:47:27,307 --> 01:47:30,607
Inaba,
I saved you some cake!

1488
01:47:38,552 --> 01:47:41,954
Who's the one that
ate Inaba's cake?!

1489
01:47:44,357 --> 01:47:46,622
It must be you!

1490
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:48,460
It wasn't me.

1491
01:47:48,528 --> 01:47:50,497
Someone eat it by mistake?

1492
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:52,030
I don't know.

1493
01:47:55,001 --> 01:47:56,799
Nasty! Who did it?!

1494
01:47:57,671 --> 01:47:59,731
Sure it wasn't you?

1495
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,968
I didn't eat it!

1496
01:48:02,676 --> 01:48:04,668
Who ate it?!

1497
01:48:07,414 --> 01:48:10,782
<i>The suspect of the thefts,
Risako Kano,</i>

1498
01:48:10,917 --> 01:48:13,887
<i>said seeing others overreact to...</i>

1499
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:18,617
<i>the ongoing thefts
relieved daily stress at work.</i>

1500
01:48:26,533 --> 01:48:29,662
Did anybody see Noriko's pen?

1501
01:48:30,103 --> 01:48:33,335
I just saw it a minute ago.

1502
01:48:34,407 --> 01:48:37,002
Anyone seen a brown pen?

1503
01:48:40,547 --> 01:48:43,016
Haven't seen a brown pen?

1504
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:47,654
I know who stole it.

1505
01:48:52,392 --> 01:48:54,190
What are you saying?

1506
01:48:56,963 --> 01:48:58,329
Well,

1507
01:48:58,598 --> 01:49:00,328
I wonder what I'm saying?

1508
01:49:02,035 --> 01:49:06,268
<i>The threat of being exposed
made Kano feel uneasy,</i>

1509
01:49:06,973 --> 01:49:11,707
<i>and she focused her attention
on none other than 'Ms S'.</i>

1510
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:20,043
Excuse me...

1511
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:24,717
Perhaps it's because of Noriko?

1512
01:49:25,825 --> 01:49:30,854
<i>But 'Ms S' thought only of
going to the violinist's concert.</i>

1513
01:49:31,097 --> 01:49:32,360
Wait...

1514
01:49:32,766 --> 01:49:37,568
<i>Kano saw an opportunity
to skillfully exploit 'Ms S'.</i>

1515
01:49:37,938 --> 01:49:41,739
<i>But how extensive was her plan?</i>

1516
01:50:51,711 --> 01:50:53,145
Why?!

1517
01:51:09,896 --> 01:51:12,957
<i>Kano wasn't satisfied with stabbing.</i>

1518
01:51:13,099 --> 01:51:20,165
<i>She knew lighter fluid from the BBQ
was still in the car of 'Ms S'.</i>

1519
01:51:47,734 --> 01:51:49,202
Lovely...

1520
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:53,872
Hello...

1521
01:51:53,973 --> 01:51:56,033
Hello? Hello...

1522
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:03,472
<i>Furthermore,
to mislead the enquiry,</i>

1523
01:52:03,583 --> 01:52:09,545
<i>she contacted a university friend who
was a TV news temp worker,</i>

1524
01:52:11,424 --> 01:52:15,384
<i>leading him to believe
'Ms S' was the criminal.</i>

1525
01:52:15,462 --> 01:52:18,057
It might be best if she did it.

1526
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:23,229
<i>Have criminals really become
so terribly selfish these days?</i>

1527
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:27,730
<i>Regarding the motive for her crimes,
Kano said...</i>

1528
01:52:28,341 --> 01:52:30,401
I didn't want to lose my job.

1529
01:52:32,345 --> 01:52:33,608
Just for that?

1530
01:52:36,116 --> 01:52:37,209
Yes.

1531
01:52:38,184 --> 01:52:40,050
<i>That was her response.</i>

1532
01:52:47,127 --> 01:52:49,255
Stress built up over time.

1533
01:52:49,796 --> 01:52:53,597
She testified that she was
afraid of losing her place.

1534
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:54,929
Losing her place...

1535
01:52:55,135 --> 01:52:59,766
It seems possible the suspect
suffered from a complex.

1536
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:04,004
No, Kano graduated from a
prestigious university.

1537
01:53:04,144 --> 01:53:10,050
The company superior said Noriko
may have had a junior college complex.

1538
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:11,651
Some years later,

1539
01:53:11,718 --> 01:53:14,620
<i>Kano could've become
Noriko's boss?</i>

1540
01:53:14,721 --> 01:53:16,451
<i>That is possible.</i>

1541
01:53:16,556 --> 01:53:20,186
<i>Regardless, to put it simply,
she was very shallow.</i>

1542
01:53:20,326 --> 01:53:22,022
<i>Total lack of ethical values.</i>

1543
01:53:22,162 --> 01:53:24,256
<i>It leaves us astounded.</i>

1544
01:53:24,397 --> 01:53:25,194
<i>It does.</i>

1545
01:53:25,331 --> 01:53:27,027
We have a statement...

1546
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:28,031
Yes...

1547
01:53:28,434 --> 01:53:33,566
Due to our failure to do research
during production,

1548
01:53:33,706 --> 01:53:38,167
an innocent person became a suspect,
we apologize.

1549
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:40,610
We offer our humblest apologies.

1550
01:53:41,414 --> 01:53:43,940
Moving on, our next topic...

1551
01:53:44,117 --> 01:53:45,449
<i>That's all?!</i>

1552
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:47,610
<i>All over?</i>

1553
01:53:47,954 --> 01:53:50,287
<i>Apologize to Shirono!</i>

1554
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:54,119
<i>I'll totally object to this report.</i>

1555
01:53:54,294 --> 01:53:56,957
<i>Shouldn't watch such stuff.</i>

1556
01:53:57,130 --> 01:53:59,122
<i>You watched too!</i>

1557
01:54:01,267 --> 01:54:03,668
Why are you sitting around?!

1558
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:08,533
Don't need to be here.

1559
01:54:09,275 --> 01:54:11,141
Akahoshi went to apologize...

1560
01:54:11,244 --> 01:54:13,145
Of course he did!

1561
01:54:14,113 --> 01:54:16,139
You're also in trouble.

1562
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:23,481

Right.

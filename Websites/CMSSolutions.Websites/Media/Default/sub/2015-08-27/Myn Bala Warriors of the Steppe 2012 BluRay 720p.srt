00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,502
Look, Zhomart!

3
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:09,135
They look like Dsungars.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,378
Follow me up there!
There are two!

5
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:24,046
Fast, Sartai! Quick! Get out of here!

6
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,586
Zhomart! Stand up!

7
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,965
One less.

8
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,590
That was a child.
Why did you do that?

9
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,378
Now do not get upset so on.
You know how it is.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,756
Today was just a child,
and tomorrow it's a soldier.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,718
Enough. Let's go.

12
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:38,511
Drive them together!
Let no escape!

00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,761
At least let the children and the old people go!

15
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,590
Now this is our country, Kazakh!

16
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:03,106
You have lost nothing here!
Save yourselves if you can!

17
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,588
Let your cattle and your possessions
back and get out of here!

18
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:08,256
Father! Father!

19
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,175
Father!

20
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:13,500
Hey! Dsungars you dirty bastard!

21
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:16,219
Clarify the  we as men,
if you dare!

22
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,044
Father!

23
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,300
Father! Father!
You can not die!

24
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,045
Father, no!

25
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,594
- Father!

26
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,920
My son. Running, fast!

27
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,173
Let him go!

28
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:54,875

00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,469
Korlan, take Aibek!

31
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,214
Sartai!

32
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:20,592
Mother! Mother! Please wake up!

33
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,926
Sartai, come on!

34
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,708
Korlan! Sartai!
Hurry up, hurry!

35
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:30,962
Run fast in the fields!
We can only flee.

36
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:19,133
Aibek, look! There are Sartai
and the others. - Hooray!

37
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,636
- Sartai, you're back!
- Korlan!

38
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:22,965
Well, you, how are you?

39
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,923
Kamshat, Aibek, are you all right?

40
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,094
- Taimas is difficult that?
- Have you been taking care of our home?

41
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:35,501
- I'm very hungry!
- Taimas, son.

42
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,468
Hello, Mother.

43
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,300
Nice to be here again.

44
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,969
Look at the times of the many meat!

45
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,900
Asalam aleikum!

46
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:49,593
ALEIKUM salam!

47
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,132
How are you?

48
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,135
Well, my boy. Tell!

49
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,333
Was your hunt successful?

50
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,922
I have killed a deer.

51
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,469
You're a good hunter.

52
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,344
- Has no one seen you?
- No.

53
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:07,548
We were careful and have kept their eyes open.

54
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:11,213
But if we had encountered enemies, my arrows had done it.

55
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,343
That is right!

56
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,586
- Yes, hit!
- A very nice results.

57
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,127
Well done!

58
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,965
Very good, Taimas!

59
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,883
Screaming swung the mighty Karaman...

60
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:19,717
... His sword and struck full force with
Alpamys Shield.

61
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:23,667
Alpamys
spectacular block the blow and hit Karaman's head.

62
00:07:23,702 --> 00:07:25,923
He split him like a nut.

63
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,465
Karaman's warriors made returns and fled.

64
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,715
Since then freezes in fear Alpamys' name
his enemies.

65
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,550
He had the will to defeat it,
and courage helped him.

66
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,298
If Alpamys today would still be alive,

67
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,964
... then the Dsungars would never trust
to attack us.

68
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:48,542
He is still a hero among the Kazakhs
,

69
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:52,298
... the steadfast fight against Dsungars today.

70
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:57,134
A shame that they did not join forces and fight together
.

71
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:20,092
Like I said!
Nowhere to see a Dsungar.

72
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,423
This is our beautiful desert.

73
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,939
Enough with the game of hide
in our home!

74
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:27,421
Listen to what it .
Talk almost like a man

75
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:30,045
who  catches me, has won!

76
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:07,338
So you've let you instigate of Taimas
, am I right?

77
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:12,884
Do you think I do not know that you were in the
steppe? My only makes us trouble.

78
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:18,593
Do you want that?
Your carelessness can threaten us.

79
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:22,797
Uncle? Do not treat us like children.

80
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:24,635
We are already grown up.

81
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,049
Korlan is a real woman and I'm not a fool.

82
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,420
So do not blame Taimas.

83
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,756
All right, calm down.

84
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,299
Listen to this boy only!

85
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,211
You've become quite large.

86
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:48,966
If so, I'll take you
well with New Year celebrations.

It is not only outrageous, but also arrogant
!

00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,381
Enough is enough!

150
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,628
Why are you arguing?

151
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,336
I know a man who
of hiding from the Dsungars,

152
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:42,051
... but I know

153
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,840
... that his heart is free.

154
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:50,962
But you let enslave you,
although you are free. You mock us.

Uncle? I do not get it.

Why does Rakhimzhan to
as they are good friends?

159
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:32,842
Who knows?
Maybe he pursues his own goals.

00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:36,337
The village and protect his family.

161
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,835

00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,673
It's time for revenge.

179
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,754
I am to you.
I will fight with you.

180
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,173
I swear that I will fight to the death in
.

181
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:09,042
Whatever happens, I will do everything
to destroy the Dsungars!

182
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:10,840
- I swear!
- I swear!

183
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,755
I swear.

184
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:16,881
Today we will ride together in the steppe.

185
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,218
It is almost done.

186
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,469
Go and see what's going on.

187
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:16,758
Did not you  before, wake us up,
when the food is ready?

188
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,337
In the time you had to cook a soft
stone.

189
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,377
What happened?

190
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:04,546
It's all good, Korlan. Let's go.

191
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:33,045
Uncle Sabit! Grandmother!

192
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,715
Come quickly here!

193
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,298
Who is that?

194
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,543
Do not come any closer!
Sabitzhan who the, what do they want?

195
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,924
One step closer and I'll kill you!

196
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,134
Leave us alone!

197
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,090
Ye shall disappear!

198
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,175
We do nothing to you.
What happened? Where are you from?

199
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,544
I'll tell you.

200
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:59,255
The Dsungars have people killed and our cattle.

201
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,965
We got away just yet.

202
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,002
We are already on their feet for
days.

203
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,213
Move strangers have shared with us their food,

204
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:09,506
... But it hardly gave himself for it

205
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,593
then accompanied us.

206
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:16,627
Go with us. The
is safer for you than be alone.

207
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,552
We need to start to worry
for ourselves.

208
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:21,089
What is your name?

209
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,300
Sabit.

210
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,299
Good. We accompany you.

211
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,878
Sultan Abul Khair has arrived.

212
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,251
Asalam aleikum.

213
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:39,261
Asalam aleikum!

214
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,423
ALEIKUM salam!

215
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,552
Come in, Sultan. After you.

216
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:11,168
Sure you know what is going on in the steppe
straight forward, is not it?

217
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:18,047
The Dsungars have shifted their forays into our country.

218
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:21,340
You gather thousands of soldiers.

219
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:25,465
Why we must fight them now,

220
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,629
... as long as their horses still from the winter are weak.

221
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:34,007
The people are ready to fight for a long time
.

222
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:39,469
All we have to do is to pull the
khans and sultans on our side.

223
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:46,595
You speak of what the
bitter truth for all of us, unfortunately.

224
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:53,926
Let the khans and sultans
inform them.

225
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:54,509
Yes.

226
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:03,295
Invents, I Iüge. It's true!

227
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,461
Who is that? There's a girl.

228
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:19,876
Do not twist your head.
I do not smell anything good.

229
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:21,919
Nonsense! We grab us!

230
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,878
Then just pass on to the horses.

231
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,335
- What are you doing?
- Fast, it escapes!

232
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:35,209
Come back, it's a trap!

233
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,001
Damn!

234
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,177
Fast, we drive
the horses together!

235
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:34,300
Taimas! We ride through the canyon,
to cover our tracks!

236
00:24:34,335 --> 00:24:37,375
- This is too big a detour.
- Does not matter!

237
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,465
Clear! There are only children.

238
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,925
Take your bows down
do not be afraid.

239
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:12,504
Where are you from?
And where do you want?

240
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:20,757
We are warriors who want to take revenge on the
Dsungars.

241
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:25,218
These horses we have stolen from them in order to trade against
guns.

242
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,713
This country needs you.
What is your name? Who was your father?

243
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:33,129
My father was a warrior.
He ​​died in battle.

244
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:38,001
Our brothers and fathers were all killed by Dsungars
.

245
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,882
I'm Sartai. And your name is?

246
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:44,672
My name Borybai and this
here are my warriors.

247
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:58,965
We move west.

248
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,381
Soldiers gather there, to put
Dsungars to defend against.

249
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,844
We could use you.

250
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,542
No, we
fight on another front.

251
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,094
We will even take care of them.

252
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:19,257
Listen, what do you say

253
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:22,375
... if we half the
horses for a few weapons...

254
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,978
... And swap clothes?

255
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:27,546
And then join you?

256
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:31,422
We can not do that.
We run your own war.

257
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,211
Well, you shall get,
what you need.

258
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,298
I'll talk to him.

259
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,126
So?

260
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,422
I hear.

261
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:24,587
Were these horses just so around in the desert?

262
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,840
Or are they perhaps come naturally to you?

263
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:33,176
Carelessness could cost you your life.
Have you ever thought about it?

264
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,632
It is not the first time

265
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:41,547
... that we escape the Dsungars are
. As you can see, we are still alive.

266
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:46,428
Support us but rather, blame and
not because we dare something.

267
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:52,676
good. We do not argue.
Then the horses in the barn houses.

268
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,002
Then we'll see.

269
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:59,427
I knew he would have to talk to
.

270
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,968
I do not understand how can Rakhimzhan
fraternize with the Dsungars.

271
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:20,045
Rakhimzhan Who is this?

272
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:24,172
A man who is willing to give
to his enemies.

273
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:28,129
Or, Sartai? That he is!
A cowardly dog.

274
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:30,007
Yes, but he has a pretty daughter.

275
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:32,420
What interests me is the daughter of a traitor?

276
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,170
Let's drink to her village,
and what to ask girls!

277
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:38,626
Sounds good.
We ride directly toward tomorrow.

278
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:42,751
This is difficult
there was controversy. You know that

279
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:46,459
So what? We go to them and smooth things
.

280
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,673
Tell them that you're sorry...

281
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:52,793
... And then we can finally take care of the important things to
.

282
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,594
Asalam aleikum!

283
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,835
ALEIKUM salam, sit down.
Take something to eat.

284
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,007
Come, go over there.

285
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:31,795
Ayan? Go and bring them something
mare's milk.

286
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,980
Good to see you again.

287
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:40,090
So I did not expect.

288
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:43,423
I hope that I have not offended you
.

289
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:49,010
Do not worry, I overreacted.
Please forgive me, I was rude.

290
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,006
Yes. If I may ask...
Where are you from? What are you doing here?

291
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:57,876
We move around and want to argue against the
Dsungars.

292
00:30:58,042 --> 00:31:00,215
We are from the village of honorable Nazar.

293
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,675
We have vowed to fight the enemy together
.

294
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,843
- Amantay?
- Yes?

295
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:10,713
- How about if what you sing to us?
- Sure, give me my dombra.

296
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:25,132
I already walk around on this earth as long as
.

297
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:30,669
I can not even count that I have trodden the paths.

298
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:35,843
I have met warriors,
like lions.

299
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:40,884
I've seen
who protects her clan men.

300
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:49,298
And recently I've seen a cock

301
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:53,042
... the strutting among his whole
hens.

302
00:31:55,792 --> 00:32:00,502
But then I saw that only
some feathers from him were left

303
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:05,464
... rushing down as a hawk from the sky and grabbed him
himself.

304
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,583
I would give you an answer,

305
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:14,712
... if I would have mastered the art of playing
.

306
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,173
What a strange song is that?

307
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:21,425
We sing about the Dsungars  bones,
we scatter in the desert!

308
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,294
We welcome our enemies are not welcome.

309
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:28,585
Unlike the people, the
fraternize with their enemies.

310
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:29,463
I see.

311
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:33,136
Your
fed us and then spits it into our faces.

312
00:32:33,171 --> 00:32:36,208
My dear
should avoid pushing your luck.

313
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:39,840
No one will give you protection here.

314
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,175
How about when you
the Dsungars are not complacent,

315
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,919
... but it makes you complacent?

316
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:47,591
What the hell are you going to tell me about?

317
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:54,167
That's it. You'll
rude again. The second time

318
00:32:54,875 --> 00:33:01,258
If you were not my guests would,
I personally continue chasing you out of here.

319
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,636
- Hey, show us your saber!
- No, disappears!

320
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:18,011
- Please!
- Pulls leash!

321
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:19,047
Vulgarity!

322
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,799
Hey, wait. Wait a minute!

323
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,755
Who are you?

324
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,298
My name is lliyas.

325
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:32,837
Appreciate your Rakhimzhan incorrectly,
he is very good-natured.

326
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:34,923
It helps orphans and widows.

327
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:37,802
Mich. He has also recorded with him.

328
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:41,375
You must not condemn him,
because he is trying to protect us.

329
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,377
He does it for our own good.

330
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:46,048
Have you forgotten that you're
Kazakh?

331
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:48,962
Or maybe you want to be a slave to the
Dsungars?

332
00:33:48,997 --> 00:33:52,132
What are you talking about for a nonsense?

333
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,506
"Slave," I'll show you!

334
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:56,377
If you're brave, fight!

335
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:57,882
Why are you doing nothing?

336
00:33:57,917 --> 00:34:01,523
I'm not from here.
I teach the children.

337
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:05,130
But I am always willing to provide me
the enemy.

338
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:10,043
Then opt .
Come with us, or stay here.

339
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,959
I'm going to get my books.
Without them I'm not coming.

340
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:20,669
Agreed.

341
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,883
How do we find a way out of this impasse?

342
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:32,967
Either we are slaves for the rest of our lives

343
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:36,041
... or we begin to
to fight for our country!

344
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,927
- Yes, exactly!
- Very true!

345
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,461
Our only chance is a trading
with Galdan, or we're dead

346
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:47,302
Absolutely not. That would not be good.

347
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,715
No, that's not good!

348
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,381
Otherwise we will always draw the short straw
! We need to negotiate!

349
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:57,333
We are not many, and our country is broke.

350
00:34:57,368 --> 00:35:00,251
Dsungars with the parts we have, and there is peace!

351
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,761
No, this is our country!

352
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,754
I share nothing with these monsters!

353
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,422
Calm down!

354
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,132
We do not want
killer in our country!

355
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:16,880
Mortal enemies can never be friends! The hate for it to sit deep.

356
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:21,507
Bugun!
If we sell them our country today,

357
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:26,969
... then it could be
our women and children tomorrow.

358
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:28,380
No compromises!

359
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,044
- Exactly!
- Right!

360
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,629
And who of you is willing to fight and die
?

361
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,924
Tell it to me! Who? Come on!

362
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,210
Silk but reasonable!

363
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:43,004
You will not regret it, if you negotiated with the
Dsungars!

364
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:48,003
You're the one who spotted our flag!
Not Dsungars.

365
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:49,752
We must finally unite!

366
00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:51,844
He's right! Enough is enough!

367
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,799
- Do not compromise!
- Exactly!

368
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,176
It brings us nothing,

369
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,802
... to accuse each other.

370
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:04,511
- This is also true.
- Yeah, right.

371
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:08,463
Our goal should be to
all to pull together.

372
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,297
Only way we can regain our freedom
.

373
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,877
We need to unite.

374
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:17,673
- Yes!
- Right!

375
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:19,009
Do we's finally!

376
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:20,840
My friend,

377
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,344
... exactly this attitude I expected from you.

378
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:27,215
I say unto you, my brethren,

379
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,215
is... from this day on the honorable...

380
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,754
... Abul Khair Mukhamed
lead the Kazakh army!

381
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:35,297
- He is our commander!
- Yes!

382
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,419
Come to bed!

383
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,924
- Bugunbai to be his right hand.
- Yes!

384
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,923
Then your blessings.

385
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,132
Yes!

386
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:48,876
- Amen!
- So be it!

387
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:57,844
Sagittarius, Allah, our people and bring us
by your kindness to victory.

388
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:58,629
- Amen.
- Amen.

389
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:11,383
It is  to take the time to fight for our freedom
!

390
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:12,627
In the battle!

391
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,382
Do you remember,

392
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:34,423
... that was spoken in Rakhimzhan about the
Akzhar Fortress?

393
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:38,918
The Dsungars use it as their base
. There are no residential buildings.

394
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:43,377
What do you think, if we provide a
bit of an uproar there?

395
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:49,675
Then we should prepare.
And well equipped. We are only five.

396
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,298
No, four and a girl. Even if we do not take the mounting

397
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,274


398
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,173
... we'll scare them a
terror.

399
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:01,178
We should go to the Shagal Bazaar.
There we can...

400
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:04,296
Collect information.
We are planning on.

401
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,219
Good idea, so let's do it.

402
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:15,009
Let us leave today We should not waste time.

403
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:00,010
- Korlan, lliyas?
- Yes?

404
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,300
Wait here for us.
Take care of the weapons!

405
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,466
You look at that.
This is a lion.

406
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:32,173
Hey! Disappears there!

407
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:35,673
Power that you
come off here! Go on, get out of here!

408
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:41,294
Way! Have you not heard?
You stand in your way! Make way!

409
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,965
We share us best.

410
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,209
Keep your eyes open and you realize what you hear.

411
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,882
I hereby declare,

412
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:55,132
... that in the case of
Kazakhs three brothers...

413
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:56,885
... The verdict of the judge is as follows:

414
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,298
For horse theft...

415
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:02,416
... And the murder of a Dsungar...

416
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:06,257
... The eldest of them is punished with death. The other two are sold
as slaves and the money...

417
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:09,842


418
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:13,133
... Benefit of the
Dsungars murdered family.

419
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:21,292
! Kazakhs!
Kazakhs, arise!

420
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:25,177
This is our country!

421
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,925
Only we have the right!

422
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:35,092
Fight the Dsungars
until their last man!

423
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:38,260
You bastards!

424
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:47,501
And makes the two others your slaves.

425
00:40:47,536 --> 00:40:50,173
We do not want to continue to care for us.

426
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:54,588
We have not made us guilty before God
! Take them away!

427
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:12,716
Here forth with the scum!

428
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:15,801
Bring them over here!

429
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,006
Set it on the car!

430
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:23,090
For this, you will still pay for this!

431
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:28,298
', She captivates! Tie them up!

432
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:32,338
This is what happens to those who dare to stand up to the
Dsungars!

433
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:43,793
Who gives them the right to judge
about our country? These bastards!

434
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,380
Tomorrow will watch
twenty Dsungars the slave caravan.

435
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,423
Shall we attack them?

436
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,927
Do you know who gives the orders?

437
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:58,043
Who?

438
00:41:58,875 --> 00:41:59,842
Ayur.

439
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,135
I have an idea.

440
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:08,386
I know who is
certainly like to help us.

441
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:21,339
Listen.

442
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,048
If you be free...

443
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,713
... And you want revenge on the Dsungars
, do what I tell you.

444
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,671
Here.

445
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,714
Hidden das.

446
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:43,219
If we attack the caravan tomorrow
'll stab her so the guards.

447
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,460
And you are who? '

448
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:50,051
I'm Sartai.

449
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,711
A Kazakh, just like you.

450
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,092
Good.

451
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:58,761
Freedom or death!

452
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:05,423
Hey! Way there! Get out!

453
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:11,511
What you doing?
Dirty Pack! Take that!

454
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:25,635
Come on, faster!

455
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,756
Run on, you rats!

456
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:58,542
- Caution, Kazakhs!
- Men, gather yourselves!

457
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,760
This is it.

458
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:20,085
You are surrounded.
Surrender, or you will be killed.

459
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,209
He said we were surrounded and
that we should surrender.

460
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:38,465
Do you know who I am? If not,
I will tell you like it!

461
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:42,960
I am the son of the powerful knight
Zhonon Batur!

462
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:47,673
On your place I would think twice
me, because just what you are doing!

463
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:52,213
If you value your lives,
not keep up us on longer!

464
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:56,189
If you are Ayur,
I challenge you!

465
00:44:56,224 --> 00:44:59,087
He has proposed a duel. Your
against him.

466
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:02,251
What are you doing? A duel?

467
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:04,711
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

468
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:57,387
This can not be.
He ​​defeated him.

469
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:04,881
I won. Remind yourself
my name! My name is Sartai!

470
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,593
Attack!

471
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:10,339
Attack!

472
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:16,461
Korlan! Let them flee.

473
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:22,885
Yes, it runs! Go tell everyone that has
Sartai won!

474
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:10,261
Lliyas  You can read about it?

475
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,842
Show me.

476
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:18,710
- This is not just a simple letter.
- You. For whom is this letter for?

477
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:22,629
If you spare me,
I'll tell you.

478
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:25,883
According to your law would hang you anyway.

479
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,344
It's enough
if you give me a horse.

480
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:31,467
Sartai!

481
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:33,965
You have been good.

482
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,004
It was a pleasure.
Can we join you?

483
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,379
My name Asan,
this is my brother Usen.

484
00:48:39,414 --> 00:48:41,719
What do you think?
You will not regret it.

485
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:45,259
Agreed.

486
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:57,048
Sartai? If we let him go, he is
tell us something about this letter.

487
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,632
Is it something important?

488
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:02,921
We really want to listen to his chatter?
Kill him like the others.

489
00:49:02,956 --> 00:49:04,548
You just want to kill him?

490
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:06,673
We should prefer
collect information.

491
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:10,508
I do not care. If you can not,
I'll do it myself.

492
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:13,336
- Stop Taimas.
- Leave me alone!

493
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:16,632
Those bastards want to drive us out of our home...

494
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:18,423
... And now they have to bleed for it!

495
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:21,712
We will only take weapons and horses.

496
00:49:21,747 --> 00:49:24,007
We can use any baggage.

497
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:27,922
Oh yeah? Since when do you decide
everything we do?

498
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:31,959
Sartai is right.
Take only the essentials with.

499
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:33,255
Yes, of course.

500
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:42,969
- We will spare you.
- I thank you.

501
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:47,042
The letter should by Akzhar.
A day away from here.

502
00:49:47,077 --> 00:49:50,751
I understand. You are free.
Go where you want.

503
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:54,962
On! We've been here too long.

504
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:12,840
Taimas seems upset.

505
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:14,084
Let him.

506
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:17,335
He calms down.

507
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,253
Chinese tea.

508
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:39,084
- How good it smells! Smell!
- Everything stolen.

509
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:42,920
I hope this ends well.

510
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,511
Not underestimate the matter.

511
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:50,135
Sabitzhan.

512
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:53,086
We have not stolen anything.

513
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:57,380
We have saved our brothers.
How long we should still hide?

514
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:59,335
Approximately forever?

515
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:06,302
The Dsungars come!
The Dsungars come!

516
00:51:06,337 --> 00:51:09,796
Listen everybody!
The Dsungars come!

517
00:51:24,792 --> 00:51:27,796
What is this uproar?
What happened?

518
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:31,878
We are looking for a Sartai
Where can we find him?

519
00:51:31,913 --> 00:51:35,007
The Knight Zhonon Batur
wants to speak to him.

520
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:39,468
If Zhonon has something to say, then
I will speak with him personally.

521
00:51:39,503 --> 00:51:43,417
This will not please Zhonon.
We have an explicit command.

522
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:44,714
What do we do?

523
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:51,380
No time!

524
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:54,253
Do not say we did not warn you.

525
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:16,925
It will not be easy.
We need a plan.

526
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:21,792
First, we should draw out the warrior
from the fortress.

527
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:25,632
And then they all kill
between these two hills.

528
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:29,751
So it should be easier to get into it.

529
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:36,339
We attacking at night.
We do not know how many there really are.

530
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:41,668
At night they come out not sure
. We must do it now.

531
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:43,260
We are strong enough.

532
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,878
We need to catch before.

533
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:52,719
Since there are certainly 50 man
They have a whole arsenal.

534
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:57,088
We need to find another way,
otherwise it's too risky.

535
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:58,710
We should not underestimate that.

536
00:52:58,745 --> 00:52:59,965
What is another way?

537
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,004
I have an idea.
But it is not easy.

538
00:53:51,042 --> 00:53:52,294
Wait here.

539
00:53:56,792 --> 00:53:58,260
You can purely .

540
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:13,884
Dear Zhonon. My sincere condolences.

541
00:54:27,917 --> 00:54:30,636
There is no day without pain.

542
00:54:31,917 --> 00:54:36,798
Believe me, I understand your pain.

543
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:41,166
I also have a son, you know.

544
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,502
I know.

545
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:49,965
War spare no one.

546
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:57,460
He died in a battle like a true man

547
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,585
No one is to blame.

548
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:07,340
But now I need to find this thief Sartai
justice and punish him.

549
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:15,885
Not because my son has died

550
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:23,045
... but because he shed the blood of innocents...
Stole their cattle and

551
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:26,257
.

552
00:55:26,292 --> 00:55:32,345
This is why I am now asking you to
following favor.

553
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:39,969
Bring Sartai alive to me,
, or bring me his head.

554
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:43,630
I understand.

555
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:50,052
But that unfortunately is not so easy.

556
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:53,009
Maybe.

557
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,261
But I want it.

558
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:21,719
A white camel
crosses the land of nomads.

559
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:44,841
At first we thought you were a
Dsungar.

560
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:50,419
I'm here on business, you know?
I am interested in a girl.

561
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:53,427
Really? How's she like?

562
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:59,294
I really like them very much. She has captured my heart and
I always think of it.

563
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:04,126
And if she is not what she claims to be
?

564
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,174
She is smart and she is beautiful.

565
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:10,917
You would be a good wife, I think.

566
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:16,963
Then go easy on her and talk to her.

567
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:20,291
Maybe they can not stand you.

568
00:57:20,542 --> 00:57:24,342
I am a warrior, all appreciated.
The girls also.

569
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,673
Insignificant chatter.

570
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:30,378
You can rather keep to yourself.

571
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:33,591
You have not yet discussed with her father
.

572
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:35,968
Have you no manners?

573
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,090
Everybody here  '?

574
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:50,344
Yes, they rest a bit.

575
00:58:06,042 --> 00:58:09,546
A rider approaches,
ringing the alarm!

576
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:11,670
Help! Open the gate!

577
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,340
Help! Open the gate!

578
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:16,719
He's one of us!
It's one of us!

579
00:58:16,754 --> 00:58:18,927
Open the gate!

580
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:28,086
Who are you and what do you want?

581
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:32,050
I only speak with Yessen,
your commander.

582
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,585
Why only him?

583
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:36,777
I bring a letter from Knight Zhoron Batur.

584
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:39,715
Originally, we started out to third
Shagal.

585
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:43,459
But Kazakhs have attacked us and only I survived.

586
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:51,298
Zhonon sends us a warning.

587
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:56,260
He writes that we should take us from
Kazakhs in the night.

588
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:03,007
- What's your name, where are you?
- My name is Gunga.

589
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,550
I am from the clan of Tsevden Batur.

590
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:12,211
from far away. No wonder
I do not know you.

591
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:16,300
You beat yourself seemingly well.
Be our guest.

592
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:20,467
Give him clothes.
And let him rest. - Got it!

593
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:30,298
Let the boy out of his sight.

594
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,667
I want you to guard him around the clock
. - Got it!

595
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:44,510
Can you see him anywhere?

596
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:48,967
No, nowhere. And it's
too quiet. We wait.

597
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:24,923
Hey! Where are you going? Since
gunpowder in it. Not sniffing around!

598
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:28,129
- I have to relieve myself.
- Then go that way.

599
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:29,794
Where long, you say?

600
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:32,215
There long.

601
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,052
Guards! Guards!

602
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,218
Fits on, he got away!

603
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:43,468
I think it goes.

604
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:50,342
This is it. Get on the horse!
Hurry up!

605
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:13,884
Lliyas!

606
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:19,215
I can not see him anywhere!

607
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:21,794
We need to find him!

608
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:22,964
Lliyas!

609
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,469
- Lliyas!
- We can not go without it!

610
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:34,378
- This is it! Come!
- Lliyas!

611
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:42,167
You scared us to death!
We get out of here!

612
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:44,795
Lliyas, I got you.

613
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,377
Give me your hand.

614
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:50,965
Up you go!

615
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,507
- All right, get out of here! Quick!
- Fast!

616
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:32,385
We ride back!

617
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,378
What did you thinking?

618
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:57,667
What if they now follow your footsteps
and come here?

619
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:01,254
How do you think
is this going out?

620
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,470
You should think,
before you act.

621
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:09,461
Your blind heroism can
we all fall into ruin!

622
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:13,594
That's all grown on your
crap Taimas.

623
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:15,085
- Uncle!
- Yes?

624
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:19,836
It gives me slowly with you.

625
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:23,253
Behave kindly appropriate.

626
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:25,880
Got it?

627
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:39,632
A  Sartai always reaps all the glory.

628
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,923
And I will always blamed.

629
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:46,917
Stop it, Taimas! We all have in common
risked our lives.

630
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:52,003
Red's only one you! He is the one who is honored
and the girls get.

631
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:55,584
Taimas, you are simply just jealous of
Sartai.

632
01:03:55,619 --> 01:03:58,382
I'll show you,
how envious I am!

633
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:01,219
- Come here!
- Apart!

634
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:04,086
You all fell for it, huh?

635
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,376
I go.

636
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,877
Taimas?

637
01:04:08,042 --> 01:04:09,464
Taimas!

638
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,300
Waiting!

639
01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:22,674
Your stubborn children!
Do ye still be heroes?

640
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:43,923
Salaam aleikum!

641
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,753
ALEIKUM salam!

642
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,426
Are you from around here?
Maybe you can tell us where we need long.

643
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:53,090
Where are you going?

644
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:57,175
We are looking for a Sartai. It is said that
he is fighting against the Dsungars.

645
01:04:57,458 --> 01:05:00,712
Oh really, is that so?
Do you know anything else?

646
01:05:00,747 --> 01:05:04,133
We heard that he
recruited us as orphans.

647
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,587
He is very brave.
Let us join him.

648
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:12,964
Have you even heard of another
warrior from his group?

649
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:15,636
From a Taimas maybe?

650
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:17,127
Taimas?

651
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:20,011
- No. I have not.
- No, I do not.

652
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:24,879
Why do you want to join necessarily
Sartai?

653
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:29,463
Many groups are now fighting against the
Dsungars. Join with them.

654
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:32,840
No. We want to join Sartai.

655
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:35,924
- So you know where we need long?
- No, I do not know.

656
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:37,339
I do not know him.

657
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:44,386
We are riding on.

658
01:05:57,417 --> 01:06:01,126
Great. They ride directly toward him.

659
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,922
Sartai?

660
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:15,385
I'll be right back.

661
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:22,594
This will be Taimas.

662
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:31,635
What is it?

663
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:36,251
I'm short today in
Rakhimzhans village was.

664
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:41,338
I've seen the Dsungars,
of your father killed.

665
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,002
What did you say?

666
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:54,336
Let's ride it tomorrow.

667
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:05,386
Sartai? I need to ask you something.

668
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:07,334
And what?

669
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:14,255
How come every
that just talking about you?

670
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:18,462
You are not alone.
We are a community.

671
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:23,091
Why did you start bossing all
?

672
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:25,715
It is not intentional.

673
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:30,383
We have vowed to kill the Dsungars
! And now thou wilt spare her.

674
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:33,215
Korlan would do anything for you

675
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:37,756
... but you can only think of Zere
, daughter of the traitor.

676
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:40,094
I do not understand you.

677
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:44,838
Korlan loves both of us since we are children.
Drawing with cere not as pure.

678
01:07:44,873 --> 01:07:47,677
Well, something has changed.

679
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:51,633
Iliyas  now stands between us.
Why are you all listening to him?

680
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:53,673
Korlan, you and I
should disappear.

681
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:59,259
Let's talk afterwards and are now looking to Dsungars.

682
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,967
Father!

683
01:08:35,917 --> 01:08:37,169
Mother!

684
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:24,427
Nazar! Taimas is back.

685
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:30,086
But Sartai not sitting on his horse.

686
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:43,511
Taimas! Where is Sartai?

687
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:49,344
Where is Sartai?

688
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:00,757
We are riding down the mountains...

689
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:09,002
... And then fallen into an ambush.
And Sartai...

690
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:11,131
What Taimas?

691
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,256
Sartai was killed.

692
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:17,800
Sartai!

693
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,719
Why are you riding in the desert?

694
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:33,713
Sartai wanted to Rakhimzhans village.
I could not talk him out of it.

695
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,423
He did not listen to me.

696
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,835
Where is his body?

697
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,583
- You took him away.
- Oh no!

698
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:47,298
What a misfortune!

699
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,718
Terrible times!

700
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,506
Oh, what a terrible time!

701
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:13,380
Give me the knife.

702
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:43,919
Father!

703
01:11:57,708 --> 01:11:58,800
Thank you.

704
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,927
Here we go.

705
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:06,042
- Father, where are you? Mother!
- Sartai, run away!

706
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:08,802
Let no escape!
Drive them together!

707
01:12:08,837 --> 01:12:10,339
Father!

708
01:12:21,292 --> 01:12:22,885
Wake up.

709
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:26,882
Are you thirsty, my son?

710
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:34,967
Sartai?

711
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,002
Sartai.

712
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:58,590
- Can we come in?
- Yes.

713
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:02,129
- We get something to drink for Sartai.
- Sit down yet.

714
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,422
Here, drink this!

715
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:14,585
Thank you.

716
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:29,504
Hey, not lounging around here.
Out!

717
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:38,293
Father.

718
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,966
Sartai. Are you okay?

719
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:46,802
Zere, who gave you permission to be here?

720
01:13:46,837 --> 01:13:49,257
That was me. It's fine.

721
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:53,001
If you have served
Sartai you can go again.

722
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:03,462
Kassym, accompany Zere
and her friends.

723
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:14,255
You have recovered you again.
That really makes me happy.

724
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:17,085
Listen to me now too well.

725
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,715
The Kazakhs are planning a battle.

726
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:27,677
I've heard that
gathered an army.

727
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:30,882
Where you would be better off

728
01:14:30,917 --> 01:14:35,065
... than continue to maintain your reputation as
thief.

729
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,213
Your courage would certainly be an asset to the
warrior.

730
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,877
I think about it.

731
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:47,877
May God protect you for your care and kindness
.

732
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:53,009
Just one more thing:
Please give me a good horse.

733
01:14:53,044 --> 01:14:55,378
I want to go tomorrow.

734
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:01,759
Now What?

735
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:04,919
What's Next?

736
01:15:09,542 --> 01:15:12,967
Let the dead rest.
What is with you?

737
01:15:15,792 --> 01:15:18,966
We will continue to fight.
We riding in the desert.

738
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:20,585
Who is coming?

739
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,718
What should we do there?

740
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:29,043
We will practice on the Dsungars revenge.
We kill everyone we see.

741
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:36,758
You are right.
It brings us not to be trusted.

742
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:40,883
Taimas! Then you should lead us.

743
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:43,480
Nazar is there.

744
01:15:43,515 --> 01:15:44,946
A salaam aleikum!

745
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:46,377
ALEIKUM salam!

746
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,294
Get ready you.

747
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:53,379
We want to go and look for Sartai.

748
01:15:53,542 --> 01:15:58,173
Old man, we can decide for ourselves
what we do next!

749
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:12,632
Come on, let's go.

750
01:16:16,292 --> 01:16:17,590
Believe me,

751
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:21,459
... if you once again Uncle Nazar
insult, I cut off your tongue!

752
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:26,715
I know that Sartai still alive.

753
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,844
How do you know that Korlan?

754
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:32,301
I can feel it.

755
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:35,257
Do you want to accuse me of lying about
?

756
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:42,584
Taimas, I want you blame for anything.

757
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:45,381
Help us.

758
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:49,964
Comm

759
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:13,126
on break, as long as the
village is still intact.

760
01:17:14,292 --> 01:17:19,628
Kassym, listen to me. Take two
warrior and then wait for Amantay.

761
01:17:20,042 --> 01:17:25,173
If it is there, will you take him to the
western plains, you hear?

762
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:27,044
Then come to us.

763
01:17:27,417 --> 01:17:28,418
Yes.

764
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:32,876
What Sartai?
Take him with us?

765
01:17:33,042 --> 01:17:36,751
Zere, Sartai will only stop us.

766
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:40,052
We can not just leave him.

767
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,546
- Will he come with us?
- Yes.

768
01:17:42,581 --> 01:17:44,760
Tell him that he walks with us.

769
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:51,298
Tomorrow you'll regret that, Father.

770
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,717
Are you ready to move away, my son?

771
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:56,209
I am.

772
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:17,258
Sartai, we will go out soon.

773
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:20,882
Father has allowed
that you can go with.

774
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:25,213
Your family is in danger,
when I'm with you.

775
01:18:28,042 --> 01:18:33,003
I plan today
night ride back to the mountains.

776
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:38,710
Please come with us.

777
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,048
Please come with me.

778
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:43,468
No, I can not.

779
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:50,511
Then I'll come with you.

780
01:18:50,667 --> 01:18:54,672
No, you can not go without the
blessings of thy father.

781
01:18:56,208 --> 01:19:01,669
Zere, I love you to the very first moment
.

782
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:05,633
But now it's time for us to part
.

783
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,049
We can not be together.

784
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:20,718
What does that mean?

785
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,753
How can you just leave me?

786
01:19:25,792 --> 01:19:26,714
I...

787
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,382
Hurry up a little!

788
01:19:44,417 --> 01:19:48,342
We must have crossed the mountain pass before sunset
!

789
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,260
Nazar is here.

790
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:06,219
- A salaam aleikum!
- ALEIKUM salam!

791
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:09,632
Good luck for the resettlement, Rakhimzhan.

792
01:20:09,667 --> 01:20:14,127
But why you are so in a hurry?
Is there anything wrong?

793
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:17,925
Sooner or later it would have been so far anyway.

794
01:20:18,042 --> 01:20:22,252
By the way, we got your
Sartai to hurry.

795
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:23,209
Sartai?

796
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:38,300
Sartai!

797
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:40,675
Korlan!

798
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:46,088
My dearest brother!
You're still alive, Sartai!

799
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:51,007
- We thought you were dead
- Allah had an eye on me.

800
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:51,673
Sartai!

801
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:54,757
We have cried so much about you,
it was bad.

802
01:20:56,417 --> 01:20:58,048
Korlan has been right.

803
01:20:58,083 --> 01:21:01,633
- Our enemies are looking for you everywhere.
- Sartai, you're alive!

804
01:21:01,668 --> 01:21:04,128
I wanted to ride tonight.

805
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:05,589
Uncle Nazar!

806
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:09,918
My boy, you're alive! Thanks be to Allah!

807
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:12,670
Your hero is in good shape.

808
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:16,541
- His wounds have healed very well.
- Thanks be to Allah.

809
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:19,594
Thanks be to Allah!
Main thing is that he is healthy and alive.

810
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:22,965
I have done everything I could.

811
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,425
Nazar is here, so there is no need to worry
.

812
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:31,461
May Allah bless you. I thank you with all my heart
, Rakhimzhan.

813
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:37,010
Sartai
and I will return again to the mountains.

814
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:41,292
The other guide you safely on your
dangerous path.

815
01:21:41,327 --> 01:21:43,670
Thank you, Nazar!

816
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:47,838
- My boy.
- Stay healthy and take care of yourself.

817
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:51,132
Good luck to you.

818
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:54,671
I am Zere very grateful for their care and assistance.

819
01:21:54,706 --> 01:21:57,546
And I hope there are better times
for us.

820
01:21:57,581 --> 01:21:58,632
May you keep quite.

821
01:21:58,667 --> 01:22:01,170
It is good to know that my son...

822
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:05,297
... And my daughter a friend like you have.

823
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,594
Have a good trip home!

824
01:22:08,792 --> 01:22:10,840
Do good on you night, my friend.

825
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:13,845
Yes, we will.
We care of each other.

826
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,131
I know that. Allah be with you.

827
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:20,425
Allah be with you.
Until we meet again.

828
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:23,215
Where is Taimas ?

829
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:26,296
- He came with us,
- Sartai.

830
01:22:26,417 --> 01:22:30,217
-... but suddenly he was gone.
- Oh, what do you need it?

831
01:22:30,252 --> 01:22:33,712
Come on, guys,
Sartai help a bit.

832
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,007
For now, we go back to the village...

833
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:39,670
... And recover something of the excitement.

834
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:41,589
Come on, my brother.

835
01:23:08,042 --> 01:23:11,216
- God willing, we shall meet again!
- Good luck!

836
01:23:11,251 --> 01:23:13,085
Take good care of yourselves!

837
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,968
I'll stay here.

838
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:30,171
You go go and inform the commander.

839
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:31,676
Alright.

840
01:24:04,042 --> 01:24:05,339
Woes Wilde.

841
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:12,797
Skin off!

842
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,002
Out of the way!

843
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:38,545
Way there! Make way!

844
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:19,052
Come in, but places the weapons.

845
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:34,593
I greet you!

846
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,344
Good to see you. Sit down.

847
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:42,801
If I may speak, we count
approximately 2,000 soldiers in Anyrakai.

848
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:47,504
And  10000 stand ready in the east.

849
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:51,463
Kazakhs We monitor every step.

850
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,300
What do we know about the exact plans of their leaders?

851
01:25:57,792 --> 01:26:02,628
Currently gather your armies in two ravines Anyrakai.

852
01:26:02,663 --> 01:26:05,465
In a few days they will be
far...

853
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:09,004
... And certainly do not feel it, then
attack us.

854
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:14,340
The 20,000 warriors of Luvsan-Daichin...

855
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:18,334
... Travel approach from the west and
combine to form a single unit.

856
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:25,005
What do you think, how much have the warrior
Kazakhs?

857
01:26:25,167 --> 01:26:29,297
Less than 15,000.
They are also very poorly organized.

858
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:33,673
There is disagreement among their leaders.

859
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:37,838
Not all Sultans have agreed to draw with
in the war.

860
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:43,255
If that is so, we have
a good chance to beat them.

861
01:26:45,042 --> 01:26:47,170
We are well equipped.

862
01:26:47,417 --> 01:26:49,260
But we must not...

863
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,803
... Our troops thin out,
which are on the eastern flank.

864
01:26:58,458 --> 01:27:02,793
Luvsan-Daichin executes the command.
Follow his orders!

865
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:18,089
Zhonon.

866
01:27:24,542 --> 01:27:27,386
I would like to express you my condolences.

867
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,253
I thank you, sir.

868
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:36,047
Will not return without a victory.
I will not tolerate defeat.

869
01:27:36,082 --> 01:27:37,544
This is our country.

870
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:06,714
Enough!

871
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,300
Stop it!

872
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:28,507
The victory will soon be ours.

873
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:33,756
The Kazakhs are miserably perish
and beg for mercy.

874
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:37,300
But we will flay alive!

875
01:28:37,667 --> 01:28:42,127
Let's drink to Luvsan-Daichin!
Drain your mug! We drink!

876
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:52,677
Hey! Bring us wine!

877
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:54,335
Yes, yes!

878
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:56,756
Go get wine!

879
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:09,964
Bring me Sartais head.
And I want you Rakhimzhan kills.

880
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:11,876
To command.

881
01:29:14,625 --> 01:29:18,050
Get out of here!
Skin off! Clear the way!

882
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:17,587
Rakhimzhan,
we are now back riding again.

883
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:19,632
You are now almost safe.

884
01:30:19,667 --> 01:30:23,717
Just go, dear. Says Nazar,
that we will soon be on target.

885
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,252
A good trip.

886
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:26,752
Allah protect you.

887
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:41,176
What should we do?

888
01:30:42,542 --> 01:30:45,341
I do not know. My head smokes.

889
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:53,835
I always wanted revenge,
but it has never been what.

890
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:57,878
There is always a way out.

891
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:06,130
I've heard that the battle will start tomorrow
.

892
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:13,177
The large Kazakh warriors will fight the
Dsungars.

893
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:17,297
Is that true? '

894
01:31:59,042 --> 01:32:03,001
I would not have thought of Taimas.
He ​​has deceived us all.

895
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:08,505
If we get him,
I will kill this traitor.

896
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:09,092
Wait!

897
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,377
, Stand still!

898
01:32:12,042 --> 01:32:14,591
- Who's that?
- This is Zere!

899
01:32:16,042 --> 01:32:17,919
Please wait!

900
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:25,504
Take me with you.
I will come in to Sartai.

901
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:29,129
- Go back where you came from.
- Never!

902
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:31,927
Not even if you kill me.

903
01:32:32,167 --> 01:32:34,044
I'll come with you. Return
go back home and keep us no longer to

904
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:38,258
!

905
01:32:38,293 --> 01:32:39,797
We have no time for this.

906
01:32:41,292 --> 01:32:44,011
No one will miss me with the whole
turmoil.

907
01:32:44,046 --> 01:32:46,423
Please understand, I need to urgently
Sartai.

908
01:32:48,042 --> 01:32:51,216
If there is no love
Sartai will be pleased.

909
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:54,548
Suppose they do with us.

910
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:57,917
It keeps us not already on.
What do you think?

911
01:33:14,917 --> 01:33:16,419
Rakhimzhan!

912
01:33:18,167 --> 01:33:22,468
Rakhimzhan! Zere is gone.
We can not find them.

913
01:33:22,583 --> 01:33:28,010
Disappeared? Where should they go?
Addiction to her! Hurry up!

914
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:30,048
But what she up to?

915
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:33,383
Sure they will be followed
the other.

916
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:38,334
Two are with me riding and looking.

917
01:33:38,369 --> 01:33:41,792
Manarbek! Take care of the people.

918
01:33:49,167 --> 01:33:55,095
Why are you so desperate?
Is it just because Sartai?

919
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:57,131
On Listen to mock me.

920
01:33:57,708 --> 01:34:02,043
My father would never let me go.
Do you think it was easy for me?

921
01:34:04,042 --> 01:34:06,591
Or are you just jealous?

922
01:34:07,792 --> 01:34:12,377
Do not be silly.
He ​​is like a brother to me.

923
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:21,966
Korlan. There is Rakhimzhan.

924
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:27,593
Stop immediately!

925
01:34:32,042 --> 01:34:33,760
What are you thinking? '

926
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:37,922
Easy to disappear?
You bring us shame!

927
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:42,050
I knew you and
Kassym other hand would be.

928
01:34:42,085 --> 01:34:43,760
But I could not help it.

929
01:34:44,417 --> 01:34:47,318
Rakhimzhan, they would not listen to us.

930
01:34:47,353 --> 01:34:50,493
We told her,
they repent.

931
01:34:50,528 --> 01:34:53,633
Zere, you'll come back to us now with
.

932
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,594
We'll talk more about that later
.

933
01:34:56,792 --> 01:35:00,501
Now we should turn back, the
Dsungars getting closer.

934
01:35:00,536 --> 01:35:03,674
I beg you!
Not make me unhappy. - Enough!

935
01:35:03,875 --> 01:35:06,549
Bring not more shame on us.

936
01:35:27,125 --> 01:35:29,423
Kassym, Kassym!
Amantay is there.

937
01:35:36,042 --> 01:35:38,090
- Salam aleikum!
- ALEIKUM salam!

938
01:35:38,125 --> 01:35:39,632
We have been waiting for you.

939
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:41,260
- Where is Rakhimzhan?
- Gone away.

940
01:35:41,295 --> 01:35:43,173
I will wait for you here.

941
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:46,963
Then we ride out!
We must lose no time! - Got it!

942
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:50,882
My two rides back to
caravan and tells them

943
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:54,797
... that I've taken with me as agreed
Amantay.

944
01:36:06,792 --> 01:36:08,840
Father, what shall we do?

945
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:11,754
Stay calm.
I have gone on with them.

946
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:41,259
Zhonons permission.
Do not hold on us.

947
01:36:42,042 --> 01:36:43,794
Let us pass.

948
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:48,005
After you we were looking for. Attacks!

949
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:51,337
Kill them! Kill them!

950
01:36:56,417 --> 01:36:57,259
Father!

951
01:36:57,417 --> 01:36:59,511
Do not come near me, bastards!

952
01:37:01,583 --> 01:37:03,802
Father! Forgive me.

953
01:37:06,292 --> 01:37:07,760
Father! Forgive me!

954
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:11,462
- Zere! Racing, my child!
- Father!

955
01:37:11,497 --> 01:37:12,710
Save yourself!

956
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:18,380
Her killer!

957
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:22,379
I want you to go to Sartai!
Will happily!

958
01:37:22,414 --> 01:37:24,093
Go to Sartai!

959
01:37:25,167 --> 01:37:25,963
Father!

960
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,967
Father!

961
01:37:36,292 --> 01:37:37,418
Kill them!

962
01:37:53,333 --> 01:37:56,007
Zere! Get on a horse, quick!

963
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:57,585
Father!

964
01:38:06,417 --> 01:38:07,464
Usen!

965
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:11,834
Usen!

966
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:12,967
Usen!

967
01:38:15,708 --> 01:38:19,167
- Korlan, Zere created out of here!
- Come on!

968
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:41,710
Do not let them escape!

969
01:38:49,042 --> 01:38:49,838
Korlan!

970
01:39:07,292 --> 01:39:08,464
Korlan!

971
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:13,595
I'll hold back!

972
01:39:14,292 --> 01:39:15,589
Disappears!

973
01:40:19,083 --> 01:40:22,292
You  Grab the girls! Go!

974
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:57,839
Come on, quickly!

975
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:06,959
USER the whip, or you get nowhere more
.

976
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:10,800
It goes no further.
The horse is exhausted.

977
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,585
Take mine!

978
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:28,754
Hold on.
The horse finds his way alone.

979
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,549
- I thank you.
- Farewell!

980
01:41:32,542 --> 01:41:34,465
Bring Zere home.

981
01:41:36,542 --> 01:41:39,045
Zere!

982
01:41:40,667 --> 01:41:46,128
Sartai please tell that his father would have been proud of him
!

983
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:51,217
He ​​is the Kazakhs lead to freedom!

984
01:42:36,042 --> 01:42:37,464
Kill them, soldier!

985
01:43:32,167 --> 01:43:33,214
Mother.

986
01:43:34,667 --> 01:43:36,715
Mother, please stand up.

987
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:38,923
Taimas, where have you been?

988
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:43,088
- I'll tell you later.
- We have taken care of us so!

989
01:43:43,123 --> 01:43:45,836
- We have to go now.
- You're back!

990
01:43:46,333 --> 01:43:49,212
- Why must we go?
- Mother, please, quickly.

991
01:43:51,417 --> 01:43:54,921
Taimas  what's happening here? What's going on?

992
01:43:54,956 --> 01:43:56,669
Introduce yourself rather immediately.

993
01:43:58,792 --> 01:44:00,465
- Nazar?
- Get him out.

994
01:44:02,167 --> 01:44:05,341
Nazar? What is going on here?

995
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:11,802
My son! Tatmast
What do you do with it?

996
01:44:13,125 --> 01:44:14,672
Taimas!

997
01:44:15,292 --> 01:44:16,214
Mother!

998
01:44:21,917 --> 01:44:26,172
There is no mercy for those who wear
evil in their hearts.

999
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,470
What does not matter?

1000
01:44:31,667 --> 01:44:35,717
Your mother will not know what you've done
.

1001
01:44:35,752 --> 01:44:40,088
What do you know already?
Bring it On! Kill me!

1002
01:44:42,375 --> 01:44:46,130
We will determine his punishment later.

1003
01:45:18,833 --> 01:45:19,459
Zere!

1004
01:45:21,958 --> 01:45:24,586
What is it? Where is Korlan?

1005
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:29,969
Korlan and the other...

1006
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:33,942
-... were killed.
- Never!

1007
01:45:33,977 --> 01:45:36,301
Tell me that's not true.

1008
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:39,376
Yet.

1009
01:45:41,542 --> 01:45:43,886
I saw my father die.

1010
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:48,959
Korlan and the other could not save us
.

1011
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:55,251
They were all killed.

1012
01:45:59,583 --> 01:46:00,880
I ran away,

1013
01:46:03,167 --> 01:46:05,670
... to come to you.

1014
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:10,209
- This is all my fault.
- No, it's my fault.

1015
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,504
It's my fault.

1016
01:46:14,292 --> 01:46:15,088
Nazar!

1017
01:46:16,167 --> 01:46:19,171
Calm down. This is Allah's will.

1018
01:46:19,667 --> 01:46:23,877
He has brought in the prime of their lives to be
Korlan.

1019
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:29,423
Calm yourself, my dear.

1020
01:46:31,208 --> 01:46:31,879
Nazar.

1021
01:46:34,417 --> 01:46:35,088
Nazar?

1022
01:46:37,667 --> 01:46:39,340
- Sabitzhan...
- Be strong.

1023
01:46:42,167 --> 01:46:43,134
By Allah!

1024
01:46:44,167 --> 01:46:45,293
Please do not!

1025
01:46:45,667 --> 01:46:47,089
Please do not!

1026
01:46:47,417 --> 01:46:48,964
Please do not!

1027
01:46:59,208 --> 01:47:00,960
Korlan is dead

1028
01:47:06,042 --> 01:47:09,421
You've killed so many people,

1029
01:47:11,042 --> 01:47:13,522
... but your vest is whiter than white!

1030
01:47:13,557 --> 01:47:16,002
You go out as innocent, right?

1031
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:18,965
You have everything you've dreamed of you!

1032
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:23,257
You have the fame and the
girl by your side!

1033
01:47:23,292 --> 01:47:27,627
And I am a traitor!
Bring it On! Kill me already!

1034
01:47:28,417 --> 01:47:29,760
No, Taimas.

1035
01:47:30,375 --> 01:47:32,377
I forgive you.

1036
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:40,173
Then let me go!

1037
01:47:40,542 --> 01:47:43,751
I need to find Korlan and bury them.

1038
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:28,669
No one is against our warriors.

1039
01:48:28,792 --> 01:48:32,842
With God on our side we will defeat the Dsungars tomorrow.

1040
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,842
Very good!

1041
01:48:55,917 --> 01:48:57,257
A salaam aleikum!

1042
01:48:57,292 --> 01:48:59,795
ALEIKUM salam, sit down with us.

1043
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:03,922
I greet you.

1044
01:49:05,583 --> 01:49:07,460
Take a seat, Abulkhair.

1045
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:11,588
This here is the young Sultan Abilmansur.

1046
01:49:12,458 --> 01:49:16,173
I knew your father and
have already heard a lot about you.

1047
01:49:16,208 --> 01:49:21,214
Greetings. It is my honor to
get to know you, Abulkhair.

1048
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:25,050
He ​​takes after his father, that's good.

1049
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:29,504
Unfortunately, the two could never meet.

1050
01:49:29,917 --> 01:49:32,887
Now it is as hard as a stone.

1051
01:49:33,292 --> 01:49:38,970
I already see him fight.
He ​​is wild as an untamed horse.

1052
01:49:41,333 --> 01:49:43,381
My Lord. Amantay is there.

1053
01:49:43,625 --> 01:49:44,751
Let him come.

1054
01:49:46,667 --> 01:49:48,590
Amantay? Who is that?

1055
01:49:48,625 --> 01:49:52,050
One of us.
He ​​will bring us important news.

1056
01:49:53,125 --> 01:49:55,594
- A salaam aleikum!
- ALEIKUM salam!

1057
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:57,718
Tell us what you know.

1058
01:49:58,333 --> 01:50:00,210
Luvsan-Daichin.

1059
01:50:00,917 --> 01:50:04,217
He has an army of 20,000 men ..

1060
01:50:04,458 --> 01:50:07,337
... And marched with this in our country.

1061
01:50:10,125 --> 01:50:15,177
That is, there are at least 30,000
together. What do you think?

1062
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:17,218
It would not be our first battle.

1063
01:50:17,375 --> 01:50:19,753
We fight every day against them.

1064
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,757
We have no choice but to win.

1065
01:50:22,792 --> 01:50:25,591
Let us not put off their number of
.

1066
01:50:25,917 --> 01:50:27,134
True words!

1067
01:50:27,333 --> 01:50:32,590
This battle is crucial for the future of all Kazakhs
.

1068
01:50:33,875 --> 01:50:38,301
If we lose this war,
then we lose everything.

1069
01:50:41,083 --> 01:50:45,088
So we have to win.
Taste it what it may.

1070
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:05,126
Korlan!

1071
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:06,671
Korlan!

1072
01:51:07,167 --> 01:51:07,884
Korlan!

1073
01:51:08,375 --> 01:51:09,126
Korlan!

1074
01:51:11,333 --> 01:51:12,425
Korlan!

1075
01:51:12,667 --> 01:51:13,884
Korlan!

1076
01:51:17,333 --> 01:51:18,550
Korlan!

1077
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:40,710
Forgive me that I thought
bad about your father.

1078
01:51:43,583 --> 01:51:48,885
My father gave us before he died
, given his marriage blessing.

1079
01:51:50,375 --> 01:51:55,085
It is certainly not the right time, but...

1080
01:51:57,208 --> 01:51:59,006
... Think about it.

1081
01:52:00,417 --> 01:52:03,091
I have to make up for past
.

1082
01:52:04,708 --> 01:52:07,757
You have to go back to your family.

1083
01:52:09,042 --> 01:52:09,918
Sartai.

1084
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:13,800
No matter what happens,
I'll stay with you.

1085
01:52:15,208 --> 01:52:16,084
Zere.

1086
01:52:17,958 --> 01:52:22,338
Do not be angry, but it's not a good time
it.

1087
01:52:22,542 --> 01:52:25,173
Sartai! The Dsungars are coming!

1088
01:52:25,208 --> 01:52:29,008
Aibek, go and hide with
cere and the other in the forest.

1089
01:52:30,833 --> 01:52:34,463
Preserves peace! Goes into the mountains!
If all the mountains!

1090
01:52:35,083 --> 01:52:36,460
Where is Sartai?

1091
01:52:38,417 --> 01:52:40,385
Zere, come here.

1092
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,718
There are Kazakhs!

1093
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:09,837
- Salam aleikum, Kassym.
- ALEIKUM salam.

1094
01:53:12,667 --> 01:53:13,884
Where is Zere?

1095
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:16,719
In safety. She hides.

1096
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:20,753
I'm sorry about your father.

1097
01:53:21,083 --> 01:53:23,177
You know so already.

1098
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:27,675
I do not want to lose my only sister
. Get them here.

1099
01:53:35,042 --> 01:53:38,717
I offer you my head

1100
01:53:41,625 --> 01:53:44,094
... if I'm guilty in your eyes.

1101
01:53:45,583 --> 01:53:47,881
We ask for your blessing.

1102
01:53:53,542 --> 01:53:59,174
Morning already we are moving into a big battle
, in honor of our nation.

1103
01:54:03,042 --> 01:54:05,136
I have only one concern.

1104
01:54:07,125 --> 01:54:11,505
If I should die there,
who cares about my sister?

1105
01:54:17,917 --> 01:54:21,000
We should honor Rakhimzhans
last words.

1106
01:54:21,333 --> 01:54:23,176
Accordingly, I am ...

1107
01:54:25,042 --> 01:54:28,717
... Zeres responsible for welfare.

1108
01:54:35,417 --> 01:54:38,011
This should lead us his last will.

1109
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:43,381
You have my blessing.

1110
01:54:46,125 --> 01:54:50,676
Tomorrow's battle will decide on
all our lives.

1111
01:54:52,542 --> 01:54:56,467
We stand side by side until the end.

1112
01:54:59,917 --> 01:55:01,840
So be it, brother.

1113
01:55:02,958 --> 01:55:06,667
A long time ago I took
big responsibility for you.

1114
01:55:07,708 --> 01:55:11,918
I do not know how long
I prayed to Allah.

1115
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:16,298
And now I see

1116
01:55:18,792 --> 01:55:23,298
what 've become a strong man you are.
Therefore I will give thanks to Allah.

1117
01:55:25,917 --> 01:55:27,635
Allah hear us.

1118
01:55:30,292 --> 01:55:36,007
May you be free from the enemy our peaceful country
,

1119
01:55:36,042 --> 01:55:40,218
... so that they can rise
Kazakh tents everywhere.

1120
01:55:42,542 --> 01:55:45,045
Be the luck on our side.

1121
01:56:31,125 --> 01:56:31,876
Sartai.

1122
01:56:34,458 --> 01:56:36,460
We might never meet again.

1123
01:56:36,875 --> 01:56:41,130
But in my heart you'll be forever.

1124
01:56:41,625 --> 01:56:48,008
I want you to remember,
when you pull into battle tomorrow.

1125
01:56:50,375 --> 01:56:55,085
Zere, I love you from the very first day.

1126
01:56:56,167 --> 01:57:00,673
But I did not know about the price,
the cost to us.

1127
01:57:01,708 --> 01:57:05,042
Whatever happens, one thing you should know
:

1128
01:57:05,458 --> 01:57:08,837
I'll hold you forever in my heart
.

1129
01:57:29,875 --> 01:57:31,627
Allah!

1130
01:57:33,333 --> 01:57:36,052
- Advances closer together!
- Allah!

1131
01:57:37,625 --> 01:57:39,673
Forward, Kazakhs!

1132
01:57:50,542 --> 01:57:52,419
Allah!

1133
01:57:52,708 --> 01:57:54,051
Attack!

1134
01:57:54,333 --> 01:57:56,131
Allah!

1135
01:58:03,042 --> 01:58:05,295
Sartai. Look, over there!

1136
01:58:06,583 --> 01:58:08,585
Pans to the right!

1137
01:58:42,708 --> 01:58:44,381
The battle has begun.

1138
01:58:46,958 --> 01:58:51,043
The Dsungars are superior.
You are in the majority.

1139
01:58:53,625 --> 01:58:56,799
You have their full combat power together down there.

1140
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,379
We do not have time
to let our troops.

1141
01:59:01,250 --> 01:59:03,503
- How many are we?
- Seven of Turkestan.

1142
01:59:03,708 --> 01:59:06,211
- Thirteen of Oiyl.
- Eight of Bayanaul.

1143
01:59:06,246 --> 01:59:08,927
- Five of Torgay.
- Ten of the Urals.

1144
01:59:08,962 --> 01:59:10,382
Nine out Shalkar!

1145
01:59:10,417 --> 01:59:12,090
Sartai, we are about one hundred.

1146
01:59:12,125 --> 01:59:15,800
No, we are not.
My brothers and sisters!

1147
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,709
In our hearts we are strong as a thousand fighters.

1148
01:59:19,792 --> 01:59:21,465
Feel the force!

1149
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:24,504
Today we will take revenge!
For the shed blood of our fathers,

1150
01:59:24,539 --> 01:59:26,423
... sisters and brothers and for those in. ..

1151
01:59:26,458 --> 01:59:30,383
... Need to wander around their own country as
orphans.

1152
01:59:30,418 --> 01:59:33,548
Many of us will fall today.

1153
01:59:33,583 --> 01:59:36,792
But our courage will make us immortal
!

1154
01:59:36,827 --> 01:59:39,667
And the hand of Allah will show us the way!

1155
01:59:39,702 --> 01:59:42,465
We shall certainly make the Dsungars!

1156
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:44,298
- Let's send them to hell!
- Down with them!

1157
01:59:44,333 --> 01:59:47,671
This is the all-
decisive battle!

1158
01:59:47,706 --> 01:59:49,673
We will carry the day!

1159
01:59:49,708 --> 01:59:53,545
And we should never meet again on this earth
,

1160
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:57,383
... I promise you will
we meet again in heaven!

1161
01:59:57,418 --> 01:59:59,218
Let's get our freedom! Allah!

1162
02:00:08,125 --> 02:00:09,377
Stand by!

1163
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,297
Sets!

1164
02:00:17,292 --> 02:00:19,294
Wait for my command!

1165
02:00:29,708 --> 02:00:30,755
Shoot!

1166
02:00:37,292 --> 02:00:40,091
Archers! Shoots

1167
02:01:00,833 --> 02:01:01,629
Korlan!

1168
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,968
Shows no mercy!

1169
02:02:31,167 --> 02:02:32,669
Destroy them!

1170
02:02:33,125 --> 02:02:34,877
Power it down!

1171
02:03:01,958 --> 02:03:06,759
Tell everyone that we will fight to the last man!
Brings you victory!

1172
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,423
Spared no!
Have you no compassion!

1173
02:04:04,375 --> 02:04:07,754
My Lord, Tomor Batyr, he has fallen.

1174
02:04:09,958 --> 02:04:10,550
Go.

1175
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:11,592
Yes.

1176
02:04:14,708 --> 02:04:18,463
Whose  troop is it? You have entered the edge of the
Dsungars.

1177
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,628
Sartai, as is the banner of Dsungars!

1178
02:04:31,542 --> 02:04:34,921
Just a little piece!
We will bring it to us.

1179
02:04:35,125 --> 02:04:38,004
Let them feel our wrath! Allah!

1180
02:04:45,292 --> 02:04:47,545
Where did they come?

1181
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:49,093
Who is that?

1182
02:04:52,958 --> 02:04:55,302
Why do not they kill these savages?

1183
02:04:56,208 --> 02:04:59,382
My Lord, we have lost two generals.

1184
02:05:03,042 --> 02:05:04,043
Get out!

1185
02:05:08,708 --> 02:05:10,802
This cursed peasant pack!

1186
02:05:17,583 --> 02:05:19,426
Signals the retreat.

1187
02:05:23,833 --> 02:05:25,050
It's over.

1188
02:05:40,417 --> 02:05:42,795
Retreat! Withdraw!

1189
02:06:53,125 --> 02:06:54,001
Iliyas!

1190
02:06:54,417 --> 02:06:55,589
Iliyas!

1191
02:07:14,125 --> 02:07:15,251
What should we do?

1192
02:07:27,708 --> 02:07:28,800
There is Sartai.

1193
02:07:31,625 --> 02:07:32,342
Asan!

1194
02:07:33,583 --> 02:07:34,298
Asan!

1195
02:07:34,333 --> 02:07:35,425
My spear!

1196
02:08:15,583 --> 02:08:16,379
Taimas.

1197
02:08:16,958 --> 02:08:19,006
I got my revenge.

1198
02:08:19,458 --> 02:08:21,802
We have kept our promise.

1199
02:08:30,125 --> 02:08:32,757
Comrades!

1200
02:08:32,792 --> 02:08:35,295
We won!

1201
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:04,879
Sir, the enemy has surrendered!

1202
02:09:04,914 --> 02:09:06,718
The victory is ours!

1203
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:08,923
The victory is ours!

1204
02:09:09,125 --> 02:09:12,095
The Siegt is ours! Forward!

1205
02:09:12,875 --> 02:09:14,752
Forward!

1206
02:09:16,708 --> 02:09:19,382
The Dsungars are beaten.

1207
02:09:22,167 --> 02:09:26,172
This day belongs to you, children of Alash!

1208
02:09:29,792 --> 02:09:33,968
I told you, this is not a Dsungar
far and wide.

1209
02:09:35,917 --> 02:09:38,966
Come on! Who catches me has won!

1210
02:09:54,875 --> 02:09:59,836
Where you lead your way also,
in my heart you'll always be.

1211
02:10:18,375 --> 02:10:19,627
Next!

1212
02:10:20,542 --> 02:10:24,126
Aligns the dome for Sartaizhan
to as high as possible.

1213
02:10:25,833 --> 02:10:30,634
Zerezhan, take the two rods
and keep the tent roof. - Yes.

1214
02:10:30,875 --> 02:10:31,546
Thank you.

1215
02:10:31,875 --> 02:10:34,173
So, it depends on!

1216
02:10:35,125 --> 02:10:36,468
Nazar.

1217
02:10:38,958 --> 02:10:42,542
Nazar. We name the child after
Sartai?

1218
02:10:42,875 --> 02:10:45,628
But it is his father!

1219
02:10:45,833 --> 02:10:49,667
And how about if we rename it to
Alpamys?

1220
02:10:49,702 --> 02:10:52,173
No one will dare attack us.

1221
02:10:52,208 --> 02:10:56,714
Allah himself must have put in your mouth
those words. So be it!

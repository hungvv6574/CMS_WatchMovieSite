1
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:45,190
A long time ago, when mankind
was still in its cradle,

2
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:51,190
visitors came from the sky.
They were called the Osiris.

3
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:54,090
These gods gave us
unimaginable gifts.

4
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:58,189
The lights of which we had
never dreamed of before.

5
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,190
Astronomy, architecture, culture.

6
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,189
But all these came at a price.

7
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:12,788
The Osiris wanted earth
for themselves.

8
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:17,885
The Pharaoh, the greatest man of all,
together with the God of Sunlight Ra

9
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:21,187
opposed this threat
to their people.

10
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:25,786
Just when the visitors prepared to
summon their kin to come to Earth

11
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:30,186
an opportunity arising only
once every 5000 years,

12
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:33,085
when the stars align
in the right order

13
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:37,885
the Pharaoh stole the light from the
Osiris, blinding them with its brilliance,

14
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:40,184
leaving them in prison,
in a dungeon

15
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:44,183
hidden in the labyrinth
below his pyramid.

16
00:01:46,783 --> 00:01:49,380
But some still believed
in the visitors way

17
00:01:49,383 --> 00:01:54,383
and prepared for the time of their return.
So did the Princess Amanphur.

18
00:01:58,782 --> 00:02:04,783
Take the baby and run from here.
He is the last of the bloodline.

19
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:09,034
Give thanks to the Gods.

20
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:12,467
The worship of Osiris
will be buried with her.

21
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:14,981
Praise for her journey
to the next world.

22
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:19,861
She will be laid to rest
in the glory of Ra.

23
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:25,770
Without the Pharaoh's knowledge,
very deep below the princess's

24
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,068
pyramid grave,
a gate was constructed...

25
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,582
When the stars align once more...

26
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:37,114
the visitors would again be welcomed by
a descendant of the Princess's bloodline...

27
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:43,003
But the Pharaoh mistrusted
his princess even in death.

28
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:46,062
So he made a key.
The Key of Heaven

29
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:49,827
to lock in tightly whatever secrets
she may have kept from him.

30
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:54,779
A guardian was created
to protect the tomb.

31
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:02,778
And he made sure that no one would
tell the secrets of the tomb buildings

32
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:06,379
so that Osiris could never return.

33
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,278
But if they did, their
revenge would be terrible.

34
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:16,775
A rain of fire would scorch the Earth and
every man, woman and child would die.

35
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:23,777
Only loyal servants of the Osiris would be
rewarded and turned into Gods themselves.

36
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:28,477
The stars are approaching
their alignment.

37
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:33,776
But the Key of Heaven has been lost,
the bloodline seems to have vanished,

38
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:37,776
until now.

39
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:12,500
You're late.
It is the traffic again, huh?

40
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,569
Oh, what can I say,
it was horrible.

41
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:17,423
But you look beautiful!

42
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,063
I'm sweating and I'm dusty. Too many
hours playing Tomb Raider, Mr. Adler...

43
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:23,940
- Where is he?
- In the tent.

44
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,919
Take a look at this
before you go see him...

45
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:32,326
Beautiful!

46
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,574
You are amazing!

47
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,182
Against the risks...

48
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:49,155
7 days.

49
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:55,735
They built these pyramids to mirror
exactly what they saw in the heavens...

50
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:59,262
That mirror image only reappeared
once every 5000 years...

51
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:05,671
In seven days time,
the image will be complete again.

52
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:09,831
I checked again last night with
Mendella. They found nothing.

53
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,106
Tell him to widen the search area.

54
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,802
Tell him money is now no object.

55
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:14,988
We're running out of time.

56
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,370
We're late for Khalfani.

57
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:19,352
Oh, got to get on dealing
with that thieving goat...

58
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,365
Get the driver.

59
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,769
Yep, Masterton here.
No, that's not what I wanted.

60
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:33,617
I want it tomorrow. Not to next
week not next month. Tomorrow!

61
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:38,232
Masterton has confirmed the date.
Exactly in one week.

62
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:44,068
We have to find the entrance.

63
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:48,169
You know the tombs, right? I do not
understand why we can't locate it.

64
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:51,168
It's here.
It has to be.

65
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:57,968
We need to extend the dig. You organise the
lights so we can work through the night.

66
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:03,968
They're being delivered today. The bad
news is, there is a storm coming in.

67
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:07,567
- Oh great.
- Let's go inside.

68
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:24,767
You look tired, Professor.
Have you eaten today?

69
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:29,766
Too hot.

70
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:40,565
- You got it...
- You do not want to know how.

71
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:44,765
Why are museum staff
so damn stuffy?

72
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:49,797
Living with relics. Our people
will start looking like their dogs...

73
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:55,163
This is strange.

74
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:58,664
Now you tell me that is not
a visiting ship of some kind?

75
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:04,764
It could be the symbol of a flying god.

76
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:08,400
You know, Egypt changed
so fast at this time that

77
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:11,160
no man's aware that is
a great civilization.

78
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,563
No chance for us alright...

79
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:20,763
Like today. Just like today, cynics
will regard you as a bit of a crank.

80
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:26,763
Why, I'm as cynical as the best of them. I'm
telling you something strange went on here.

81
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,659
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

82
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,460
The Key of Heaven.

83
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,759
That's very particular.

84
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,758
You have it, I want it.
We do business?

85
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:46,458
You understand however, another interested
party willing to pay handsomely.

86
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:50,457
So tonight, the item would
want the most serious offer...

87
00:08:50,557 --> 00:08:52,858
I am a most serious man.

88
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,257
And you would be?

89
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:14,244
Mr. Levitz, come with me.
I trust no one followed you here.

90
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:16,525
Nobody got anywhere near me.

91
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:20,754
Do you know the legend
of the Key of Heaven?

92
00:09:20,755 --> 00:09:25,855
Yes, it was handed down since Egyptian times
by a sect of priests, until it went missing.

93
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:30,955
Lost. Lost, Mr. Levitz
in the midst of time.

94
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:34,555
Rumoured to be linked to the
mysterious Princess Amanphur.

95
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:37,454
How do I know it's genuine?

96
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:41,755
How do I know you can
afford such a treasure?

97
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:12,752
Ah, masterpieces, sculpture.
A miracle of survival.

98
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:16,753
You know that Hitler once sent
archaeologists here to search it,

99
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:20,052
but it remained hidden until now.

100
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:23,719
These are the Carbon testing results.

101
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:27,440
That he invite you,
it is priceless, Mr. Levitz?

102
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:32,851
- What about you?
- Let me see it first.

103
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:47,750
Well worth double the price.
I'm sure you'll agree.

104
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,550
I had in mind a trade.

105
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,850
This fine stick... 19th century.

106
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:04,750
You must be joking.

107
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:12,749
I rarely joke.
I am a most serious man.

108
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:49,431
Mr Khalfani?

109
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:02,746
Oh, Jesus!

110
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:08,733
Masterton

111
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:11,645
- I understand you seek a certain key.
- Levitz?

112
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:15,445
- Well, it just changed hands.
- You murdering bastard.

113
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:18,845
Do tell me where you are. I'm not going
to call the police and have you arrested.

114
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:22,444
On the way.
Should be with you any minute.

115
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:24,583
That beautiful walking stick
that killed him is yours.

116
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,645
It has your fingerprints
all over it.

117
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:30,945
Well, motivation is
clearly proven, Professor.

118
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:34,425
Fine. What do you want?
Money?

119
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:41,466
Money? How undignified.
I want participation.

120
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:45,643
Or your walking stick goes
to the police with a witness.

121
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:47,744
You won't get away with this.

122
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:55,275
What do we do?

123
00:12:56,544 --> 00:13:00,545
Claire, I need your advice.

124
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,422
You're gonna have to leave.
The storm is coming.

125
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:21,003
Well, keep going!

126
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:26,740
We can predict a storm. No, not this one.
The big one is coming. Look for yourself!

127
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:31,450
We'll take everything down.
I'll give you a hand!

128
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,021
OK, let's go!

129
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:37,444
Oh, for God's sake!

130
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:01,244
Stay in the car.

131
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:20,644
Someone around you just died?

132
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:25,143
This follow the things
I came to talk to you about.

133
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:29,644
This storm is not an accident.

134
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:35,944
The secret is revealed.

135
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:43,543
You were given something.

136
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:45,943
A key.

137
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:52,543
You will complete your
mission in the next days.

138
00:14:56,244 --> 00:15:01,443
A great bird Sophus...
Swimmer in the blood of men...

139
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:03,743
There's fire.

140
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:07,943
- There's fire. It will be again.
- What is it, Claire?

141
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:12,443
The signs of Osiris risen...
The signs of Osiris dead...

142
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:15,543
- I must know.
- No!

143
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:27,542
Claire, what is it?
I need to know.

144
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:33,543
Nothing.
Just a bad dream.

145
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:39,443
I leave you now.
You've been very helpful.

146
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:56,543
Yes, of course, I told him.
On his way now. Yes.

147
00:15:57,143 --> 00:15:58,442
What does he mean?

148
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:00,543
Professor Mendella insists
you see for yourself.

149
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,697
Very well then.
Let us see for ourselves.

150
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:21,542
- What is it this time?
- Not expect you to believe?

151
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:24,242
What have you got for me?

152
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,943
Look what the storm uncovered.

153
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:35,642
We thought it was all over.

154
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:45,942
I knew it.

155
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:54,543
Old friend, can you find
the entrance for me?

156
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:57,942
My dear man, we
have already started.

157
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:03,541
Assemble the rest of the team.
Call Sarah, in London.

158
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:06,642
Tell her, her father needs her.

159
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:16,516
Masterton! Professor Mendella is
exhausted. You can see for yourself.

160
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:19,057
He hasn't slept in weeks.

161
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,775
Can we delay it?
He needs to rest.

162
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:28,780
Dr. Adler! That pyramid is
an Astronomical Observatory

163
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:34,542
dedicated to a celestial event
that occurs once every 5000 years.

164
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:40,542
The next occurrence is at 12:37,
on Thursday, the 12th of this month.

165
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:44,641
Three days. Three days Dr. Adler.

166
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:49,242
I will be inside that
pyramid in three days!

167
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:19,441
Have a look at it.
I've deciphered what I can.

168
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,240
Some panels damaged, some missing.

169
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,841
Are you alright?
Time to get you home.

170
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:34,967
- Got to prepare for tomorrow
- We'll pack it in for tonight.

171
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,868
I really do not feel so good.

172
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:03,859
Maybe I can persuade
Masterton to delay a few days...

173
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:12,011
It would be preferable, but he's calculated
his timing from his astrological studies.

174
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:15,352
He won't change.

175
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,870
All right.

176
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,540
- Good night.
- Good night.

177
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,340
Your client is here.

178
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,539
Went to see the new pyramid?

179
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,641
Amazing, isn't it?

180
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,613
Do you watch me clap as well?

181
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,354
Ah my friend, this is a mysterious
country. Oh, you should know that...

182
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:25,440
You married a beautiful Egyptian woman.
People have a habit of disappearing.

183
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:31,328
- I'm just protecting my investment.
- And what would that investment be?

184
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,540
Ici...

185
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,540
Au revoir.

186
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,538
The Key of Heaven.
Without it, you can't enter the tomb.

187
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:49,139
I too have been researching the legend
of the Sun God for some years now...

188
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,940
I will buy it off.
You name your price.

189
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:53,341
<i>I have money up front.
I don't need that Masterton.</i>

190
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,540
If the legend is true, this pyramid being
exposed would seem to confirm things.

191
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,441
There are riches beyond
belief buried in there.

192
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,439
This is my mission.

193
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,940
Well, I'm coming with you,
whether you like it or not.

194
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:08,239
I am following an
explicit set of instructions

195
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,440
that were laid down
over 5000 years ago.

196
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:15,039
- There is no place for you in...
- There is now.

197
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,439
The walking stick with
your fingerprints all over it

198
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
is approaching the
police station as we speak.

199
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:26,538
Now, if I don't call my man in a...
let's see.. three minutes...

200
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:29,438
The delivery takes place
and bye-bye pyramid.

201
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:30,439
You're bluffing.

202
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:32,949
Khalfani didn't think so.

203
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,054
Only tomb you're likely to visit is
your own in a Cairo prison cell.

204
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:43,538
Not a good place to be.

205
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:50,538
Bring the key and my stick to my
office tomorrow and you can come...

206
00:21:50,638 --> 00:21:56,338
Yah and the key over inside
when we enter together.

207
00:21:56,438 --> 00:22:00,945
Stick stays with me.
Stop the delivery.

208
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,424
Professor?

209
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:27,679
Professor?

210
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,458
Professor!

211
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:41,575
Professor.

212
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:53,538
- Come on.
- Oh. It's all right.

213
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:56,539
It's all right.

214
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:04,900
- I'm okay.
- You're not okay.

215
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:11,538
Look Doug. You've studied
with me for over 4 years now.

216
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:13,378
<i>You will have to go.</i>

217
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:15,879
I don't have a millionth of
your experience, you know.

218
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,980
<i>How can I go?</i>

219
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,138
You belittle yourself. You've got a
very strong instinct for this field.

220
00:23:23,538 --> 00:23:30,759
Let's go back to your basic knowledge. You
can decipher this, you've done it before.

221
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,438
- I'm calling it off.
- It has to be tomorrow.

222
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:41,237
You know what Masterton said
about the position of Earth...

223
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:44,538
There is more to this
pyramid than meets the eye.

224
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:48,137
It's not just the burial place
of princess Amanphur.

225
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:50,838
That is a cloak.
It is part of the mystery.

226
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:54,538
Look.

227
00:23:55,438 --> 00:23:59,337
The symbols suggest Osiris.

228
00:24:00,537 --> 00:24:03,535
You have to go.

229
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,178
Don't worry... I'll survive.
I promise.

230
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:14,537
You'd better.

231
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:19,350
- You must be Sarah?
- Yes

232
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,723
I'm Ahmed. Your father sent me.
He's looking for you at the office.

233
00:24:22,823 --> 00:24:25,621
- Is the rest of the team here?
- The rest coming tonight.

234
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:41,913
Sarah...

235
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:49,458
- It's been too long.
- You knew where I was.

236
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:55,537
Yes. Since your mother died, things
been a little frantic around here.

237
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:01,536
I'd to visit her grave
before we begin.

238
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,037
Welcome.

239
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:37,536
Mama, I'm here.

240
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:44,236
You always sang a song for me
when I couldn't sleep.

241
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:46,336
Do you remember?

242
00:25:49,535 --> 00:25:55,337
That the great Princess Amanphur
and her fantastic kingdom.

243
00:25:55,537 --> 00:26:00,436
And the one day, when
the rain turned into fire.

244
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:08,336
But the Princess's children
wouldn't have to fear a thing.

245
00:26:08,536 --> 00:26:13,535
And you called me little princess.
I liked that.

246
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:19,536
Now I'll find what happened to you.
I promise.

247
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:34,453
Hi, can you tell me where
the conference room is, please?

248
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:36,662
- Yes, I'll check for you, sir.
- Thank you.

249
00:26:51,355 --> 00:26:52,453
Dr. Adler...

250
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:56,436
This is Miss Masterton.
I cannot seem to find Professor Mendella.

251
00:26:56,536 --> 00:26:59,335
My father arranged for him
meet up for a drink at his villa.

252
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:01,336
You think you could
get him there now?

253
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:05,531
Oh, he is rather tired. Is there anyway
we can delay the meeting a few hours?

254
00:27:05,535 --> 00:27:09,534
My father didn't fly me halfway across
the world, for me to wait one's sleep.

255
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:11,534
The villa in half an hour.

256
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:25,546
Dr. Adler.

257
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:28,976
- Hi.

258
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:31,170
I thought I was a little sort
with you on the phone earlier

259
00:27:31,176 --> 00:27:36,144
So I called to apologize and I
saw you answer. Where is Mendella?

260
00:27:36,836 --> 00:27:39,035
Can we talk for a moment?

261
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:41,476
I don't have much time.
My father expects me in a few minutes.

262
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:46,534
Professor Mendella is in the hospital.
He is critical.

263
00:27:47,344 --> 00:27:50,405
He had a heart attack, and he
asked me to come in his place.

264
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:56,030
With all due respect, Dr. Adler,
you hardly qualify.

265
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:58,935
Mendella's been working
with my father for years.

266
00:27:59,035 --> 00:28:04,509
Plus, he is unique in his field.
You, what are you?

267
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:09,534
I guess you'll never know, will you?

268
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,860
Sarah, this is Adam.
He'll be working with us.

269
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,534
He helped to set this up.

270
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:35,334
I've heard so much about you.
And of course, your mother.

271
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:41,169
- Really?
- I must go to the hotel, meet the others.

272
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:48,334
- Who is he?
- I'll fill you in later.

273
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:52,207
- Did you find Mendella?
- He is not coming.

274
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:55,701
He had a heart attack.
He is in intensive care.

275
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:59,202
Look, he did send his assistant along.
A Dr. Adler.

276
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:02,793
- Where is he?
- I was of sorts, I think I upset him.

277
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:03,594
He left.

278
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:06,568
Does this Dr. Adler know anything?

279
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:10,343
He has worked closely with Professor
Mendella for the last 4 years...

280
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:14,520
True and Professor Mendella
doesn't suffer fools.

281
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:18,534
This could be a disaster.

282
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:26,933
I was a little rude back there.

283
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:30,134
Look Ms Masterton, I don't want view
this anymore than you want me to view.

284
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:33,307
- That's not the point, Mr. Adler.
- It's Doctor.

285
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:37,533
Doctor can you come and join us at
the private bar at the Sphinx Hotel?

286
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:41,401
I'm really sorry I was rude,
I had no place to be.

287
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,096
Well I'm a...

288
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:55,872
- I'll be there
- Accepted.

289
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:13,478
A very beautiful sky this morning,
and yet you all look at me.

290
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:20,415
I am Professor Rohit Singh,
from India.

291
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,097
- And you must be...
- Doug Adler.

292
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:26,398
You must be the antiquities expert.

293
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:31,213
Antiquities and future.
Where is Professor Mendella?

294
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:36,033
Every piece of the jigsaw
puzzle is now on board.

295
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:39,533
- Rohit
- Professor Masterton.

296
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:41,046
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

297
00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:42,797
All present and correct.

298
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:48,533
With the exception of Professor Mendella
who sadly cannot be with us today.

299
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:52,332
- Professor Masterton... I'm sorry...
- Where is Mendella?

300
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:55,835
Mendella suffered a heart attack
in the early hour of the morning.

301
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:57,436
Oh my God.

302
00:30:57,732 --> 00:31:03,433
His ability to decipher the indecipherable
has been of immense value to my studies.

303
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:09,332
However, Dr. Adler here
has been Mendella's assistant

304
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,433
and he has volunteered
to take his place.

305
00:31:11,532 --> 00:31:15,132
Excuse me, Professor Masterton.

306
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:18,433
Professor Mendella is the
foremost authority in his field.

307
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:23,542
And for this journey
we need an expert.

308
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:26,532
Yes. Well we shall just have to
make do with what we have.

309
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:31,532
Dr. Adler has worked with Professor
Mendella for the past 4 years...

310
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:36,513
He is far better qualified than some crusty
historian we dig up at the last minute.

311
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:37,949
Hear. Hear.

312
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:42,533
It must be wonderful to carry
all your knowledge in your head.

313
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:48,432
Some must be surprised not to see you
weighed down with research material.

314
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:53,532
I don't see your back bent on the terrible
strain of credentials, Mr Levitz..

315
00:31:53,533 --> 00:32:00,432
If I may be so bold as to ask you what
bought you your passage on this journey?

316
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:04,132
Well it takes more than
knowledge to violate history.

317
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:05,132
Violate.

318
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:08,433
If we were to dig up Queen Victoria,
it would be called violate, do we not?

319
00:32:08,532 --> 00:32:12,031
Well, it depends what
you plan on doing with her.

320
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:19,631
My friends, everyone of you
is necessary for this expedition.

321
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:23,332
Every single one.

322
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:27,532
Now today, we shall go
deeper into the history

323
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:30,333
of this mysterious land
than any has gone before.

324
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:35,531
I believe that what we will find
will change history.

325
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:40,532
- To Egypt
- Cheers.

326
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:09,172
- Something wrong?
- These soldiers.

327
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:12,048
They weren't here yesterday...

328
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:30,650
Magnificent, isn't it?

329
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,701
Shrouded in mystery.

330
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:36,511
My father set his whole life for this.

331
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:38,440
And with you to help him.

332
00:33:38,531 --> 00:33:42,431
No it's my first trip with him.
My mother brought me up alone.

333
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:48,587
- Yeah. You chose this profession.
- To look for things long lost?

334
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,921
Psychiatrists would have
field day with that, wouldn't they?

335
00:33:53,622 --> 00:33:54,522
Yeah.

336
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,131
Mr Sahid here is a representative
of the Egyptian Government.

337
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:04,031
He would like to address
you, hopefully briefly,

338
00:34:04,032 --> 00:34:07,332
on the miracle that has given
this mystery back to the world.

339
00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:12,330
Professor Masterton speaks of a miracle,
yet how close it was to a disaster.

340
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:17,430
Oh come now Sahid. You should have more
faith in the ancient Gods of Egypt.

341
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,573
This was intended.

342
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:27,331
The biggest sandstorm
in history uncovered

343
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:34,529
the resting of what we believe,
is the tomb of Princess Amanphur.

344
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:39,430
When the rest of the world
was huddling in caves, this stood.

345
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,530
When Christ was being crucified
it was already under the sand.

346
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:49,431
When Christopher Columbus was sailing
the oceans, it was hidden, waiting.

347
00:34:49,531 --> 00:34:53,430
Waiting for us.

348
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:58,529
We camp here tonight,
we enter the tomb at dawn.

349
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:24,108
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

350
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,431
Want some tea?

351
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:45,119
Here I am, and I don't
even know my own father.

352
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:49,930
Or maybe this is your chance.
I mean he asked you to come, didn't he?

353
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,529
Not because he wanted me,
because he needed me.

354
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:02,145
- I never liked him.
- We don't choose our parents, Sarah.

355
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,633
Sometimes we just find them.

356
00:36:06,145 --> 00:36:09,674
Professor Mendella is more like
a father to me than my own.

357
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:14,529
Where is your mother?

358
00:36:16,629 --> 00:36:23,530
She died here ten years ago.
She went out one night to the pyramids.

359
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,528
They found her body there
the next morning.

360
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:34,104
The Police said she was robbed and
killed for her money and jewellery.

361
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:36,929
You don't believe that?

362
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:42,527
I don't know what to believe.

363
00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:47,529
My mother was a very
strong and intuitive woman.

364
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:52,025
She might have driven out alone
but it just seems unlikely

365
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:55,728
that she get herself in a situation
where she'd be mugged.

366
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:01,528
I sense you are very much like her.

367
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:05,329
Thank you for saying so.

368
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:10,029
Well I am sorry, Sarah.
If there is anything that I can do.

369
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,528
You have by listening to me.

370
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:23,529
Don't worry about me, okay?
- Okay.

371
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:44,529
Be careful with that.

372
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:58,420
That is unacceptable.

373
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:05,527
Two soldiers, and Major and
myself go with you. Agree?

374
00:38:05,528 --> 00:38:07,743
Agreed.

375
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:08,930
What does it say?

376
00:38:08,965 --> 00:38:12,949
No one may enter this
tomb and return alive.

377
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:17,627
Only the ones chosen by
the Gods who will endure.

378
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:29,607
He's right.
That's what it says.

379
00:38:30,723 --> 00:38:32,833
Nothing like a good curse.

380
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:21,527
Break it down.

381
00:39:26,527 --> 00:39:29,528
Why are letting them
destroy the hieroglyphics.

382
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:35,227
Are you done?
Seal it!

383
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:38,526
Because they sealed the entrance,
and it's the only way in.

384
00:39:44,526 --> 00:39:46,527
This is enough.

385
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:33,526
Hornets.

386
00:40:41,626 --> 00:40:44,772
Just look.
We can't get through.

387
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:53,435
Alright everyone, move back

388
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:56,526
Calmly.

389
00:41:11,526 --> 00:41:13,525
Sarah...

390
00:41:14,526 --> 00:41:17,526
- Try not to move.
- I can't move.

391
00:41:59,525 --> 00:42:01,525
Oh, my God!

392
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:30,525
We have to help him!

393
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:37,525
It's too late.

394
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,524
Way clear!

395
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,525
Well done.

396
00:42:53,525 --> 00:42:55,525
Move!

397
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:57,226
Careful!

398
00:42:57,824 --> 00:42:59,625
I thought we'd find traps
not bloody hornets nests.

399
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:01,226
It is traps.

400
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:05,823
- There's a tray of food in the chambers.
- I have a feeling we should go back.

401
00:43:06,524 --> 00:43:09,024
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Come on.

402
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:26,424
This is the sort of area
where they like to set traps.

403
00:43:26,524 --> 00:43:29,521
- Will they work after all this time?
- Hardly likely.

404
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:34,284
We found the skeletons of many tomb
robbers who go just like you, Mr Levitz.

405
00:43:36,525 --> 00:43:39,770
Criminals who
couldn't resist the gold.

406
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:40,978
Levitz, stop!

407
00:43:44,076 --> 00:43:45,577
Levitz!

408
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,524
Nobody move.

409
00:43:52,524 --> 00:43:55,965
Everybody, stay exactly
where you are.

410
00:43:56,265 --> 00:43:58,430
Everybody stand
perfectly still.

411
00:43:59,524 --> 00:44:04,523
Mr Levitz, put the statue back.

412
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:26,523
Everyone, remain where you are.
The room is unfortunately now armed.

413
00:44:30,524 --> 00:44:33,424
Mr Singh, would you
cast your eyes up ahead.

414
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:36,524
Those tiles down there, I'm sure
they have some surprises in store for us.

415
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:40,623
- Try and see if there is a sequence.
- We have to get out of here.

416
00:44:40,723 --> 00:44:42,823
And how would you say we do that?

417
00:44:42,824 --> 00:44:45,524
Other than by going ahead
and following the prescribed path!

418
00:44:45,623 --> 00:44:48,924
- What do you mean?
- We are sealed in.

419
00:44:51,424 --> 00:44:53,524
There must be a way out.
We just have to find it.

420
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:56,425
Our mission is to find the tomb.

421
00:44:56,524 --> 00:45:02,323
And whatever lies beyond it.
Now take heart, everybody.

422
00:45:02,523 --> 00:45:08,523
We can still do this.
Claire knows, don't you Clair?

423
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:13,523
- We have no alternative but to go on...
- I think I have it.

424
00:45:14,523 --> 00:45:17,923
Provided that our friends
believed in symmetry.

425
00:45:18,523 --> 00:45:21,023
Two to the left.

426
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:30,924
Stop!

427
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:35,623
Take your weight off the tile.

428
00:45:37,523 --> 00:45:39,523
Take a bag.

429
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:59,423
- Rohit, the secret is at the tiles.
- Yes

430
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:03,222
You assumed the zero ten based?
- Right!

431
00:46:03,522 --> 00:46:06,579
Well, wasn't the concept of
zero invented much later.

432
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:08,623
Good point

433
00:46:09,822 --> 00:46:11,323
One up...

434
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:17,522
Two right. One forward,
two right.

435
00:46:18,423 --> 00:46:21,023
One forward, two right.

436
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:32,385
- Well done, Mr Rohit.
- Thank you. Be careful.

437
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:36,291
- Lead on.
- It's one forward, two right.

438
00:46:37,392 --> 00:46:40,492
One forward, two right.

439
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:47,622
One forward, two right. Careful,
slow. One forward, two right.

440
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,022
Thank you.

441
00:47:06,522 --> 00:47:10,522
Another dead end.

442
00:47:11,522 --> 00:47:13,822
There's another smaller shaft here.

443
00:47:13,823 --> 00:47:16,123
It's useless if it is sealed
from the other side.

444
00:47:16,222 --> 00:47:21,422
- Dr. Adler. I need your expertise.
- He doesn't know anything.

445
00:47:21,522 --> 00:47:24,021
What if he gets it wrong,
we're all dead.

446
00:47:24,022 --> 00:47:27,022
Shut up, Levitz.
Anyone knows nothing, it's you.

447
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:30,722
- I'll take the shaft.
- I'm going with him.

448
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:37,521
Go back the way we came.
See if we missed anything.

449
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:52,822
These symbols, this place...

450
00:47:53,722 --> 00:47:56,621
- You ever had..?
- Deja vu.

451
00:47:57,321 --> 00:48:02,421
Remember it daily,
hide inside since I was a child.

452
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:08,821
Something wanted you here?

453
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:12,322
Yeah, why don't you ask your
guys what it is, won't you?

454
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:14,722
I'd sure as hell
would like to know.

455
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:37,121
What do you know about
Masterton and my mom?

456
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,821
- We all have skeletons in our closet.
- Meaning what, exactly?

457
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:47,820
Wherever we're headed down here.
Nothing was gonna deter his plan.

458
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,021
And no one is gonna stop him
achieving it. Whatever the cost.

459
00:48:54,321 --> 00:48:57,621
- What do you mean?
- I can't say anything more than that.

460
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:22,520
This is strange - it's a man.
Maybe craft.

461
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,620
Too many coincidence to have
occurred not to take it seriously.

462
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,320
Here is a classic example. Look at
the way a man has been portrayed.

463
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,119
Egyptians mummified
their Gods and Pharaohs

464
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,720
believing that they had
the secret of eternal life.

465
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,220
Hmm, so requiring the
mummification process.

466
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,420
They didn't sow it.
It was brought to them.

467
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,421
Look.

468
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:54,820
It's a machine of some kind.

469
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:01,420
I've seen exactly the same in Peru and
Mexico. Even in India we have the same.

470
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,820
Now you tell me,
how they got there?

471
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,919
The sleeper shall awaken.

472
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:16,520
The sleeper shall awaken.
The earth will tremble at his feet.

473
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,219
- Claire?
- Swimmer in the blood of men.

474
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:28,519
The sign of Osiris risen.
The sign of Osiris dead.

475
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,520
And the way shall be opened to
the true rulers of the true Gods.

476
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:35,702
What have you found?

477
00:50:36,521 --> 00:50:38,021
My guess is that,
there's a door here

478
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,918
My guess is... My guess is
you're fucking with our lives!

479
00:50:43,419 --> 00:50:45,119
Give me a hand.

480
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:07,519
Ladies and gentlemen...
We are in business.

481
00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:11,819
- Well done, Doc.
- Well done.

482
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:22,319
I used to wonder whether any ancient
Egyptian was over 5 ft 2 height.

483
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:24,419
Just step here.

484
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:14,119
So beautiful!

485
00:52:33,218 --> 00:52:34,719
Princess Amanphur.

486
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:38,518
Masterton claims that my mother
was the direct bloodline of Osiris.

487
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:40,245
She was.

488
00:52:41,444 --> 00:52:44,316
The puzzle is revealing its secrets.

489
00:52:47,418 --> 00:52:49,564
Let's take this off.

490
00:52:59,502 --> 00:53:01,633
Lift up the coffin.
Let's get rid of that.

491
00:53:10,711 --> 00:53:14,818
Princess Amanphur,
Men have not seen her face

492
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:16,998
for 5000 years.

493
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:19,603
Princess Amanphur...

494
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,128
was a Pharaoh's whore!

495
00:53:25,618 --> 00:53:31,718
Buried out here was a red herring to
conceal the true nature of the place.

496
00:53:32,018 --> 00:53:37,418
- But the tomb, is history!
- History is written by kings.

497
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:40,752
- And by Gods.
- Mr Levitz.

498
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,656
The time has come.
The key!

499
00:53:56,446 --> 00:53:58,118
The Key of Heaven.

500
00:53:58,519 --> 00:53:59,953
The key?

501
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:06,718
For Mendella this
was the Holy Grail.

502
00:54:07,517 --> 00:54:11,817
We both knew it existed.
Some scholars said it was just a myth.

503
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:15,317
Hitler searched for this.

504
00:54:17,517 --> 00:54:21,517
It was destined to come to my hands.

505
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:50,316
We are not here for
mere gold or trinkets.

506
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:58,099
The real treasure lies hidden
deep below this glittering facade.

507
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:31,216
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

508
00:55:33,316 --> 00:55:34,712
There is something down here.

509
00:55:34,813 --> 00:55:38,342
He needs you to find
whatever that is.

510
00:55:38,516 --> 00:55:41,459
You need to be careful.

511
00:55:41,517 --> 00:55:44,516
- Okay?
- Okay.

512
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,515
This place is like a labyrinth.

513
00:55:57,716 --> 00:56:01,216
Precision of language, Adam,
not "like a labyrinth".

514
00:56:01,217 --> 00:56:04,415
- It is a labyrinth.
- A labyrinth of traps.

515
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:06,617
Yeah, but the treasure.
Do you know where it is located?

516
00:56:06,716 --> 00:56:09,104
I believe that we will
find the treasure in the

517
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:11,515
deepest and most dangerous
part of the labyrinth.

518
00:56:11,615 --> 00:56:14,303
A treasure lost for
more than 5,000 years.

519
00:56:14,316 --> 00:56:16,716
The lost temple of Osiris.

520
00:56:16,816 --> 00:56:21,516
- Like a myth.
- I don't like the look of this.

521
00:56:21,616 --> 00:56:25,415
I'll go first, you'll follow.
You, Levitz, will be last.

522
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,916
You've done enough damage today.

523
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:32,515
Now, very carefully.

524
00:56:51,515 --> 00:56:55,115
Masterton!
Stop treating me like a fool!

525
00:56:55,515 --> 00:56:57,116
Levitz!

526
00:57:03,316 --> 00:57:06,415
Now what!
We're sealed in.

527
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:10,415
- Doug! Can you hear us?
- Oh, my God!

528
00:57:10,515 --> 00:57:14,915
Everyone else I need.
You are dispensable!

529
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,986
Calm down, we'll find a way.

530
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:18,631
What are we looking for?

531
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:22,415
Symbols, hieroglyphs. Something
to lead us to the inner shaft.

532
00:57:22,615 --> 00:57:25,315
There's no going back.

533
00:57:30,415 --> 00:57:33,514
We'll back track.
Find another way.

534
00:57:35,814 --> 00:57:39,515
Here. Keep coming.

535
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:45,015
Here, hold this.
The slaves often built escape routes.

536
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:06,243
Masterton.

537
00:58:08,514 --> 00:58:11,215
We need to keep going down.

538
00:59:02,014 --> 00:59:06,366
- What happened?
- He fell down, broke his neck.

539
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,367
Oh no!

540
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:13,514
- Shall we go back up?
- We don't know what made him fall.

541
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,613
What is it?

542
00:59:18,813 --> 00:59:20,614
Who's there?

543
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:27,814
- Get a grip.
- I have to find the way.

544
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:32,614
Come on.

545
00:59:34,714 --> 00:59:36,513
Slowly.

546
00:59:39,714 --> 00:59:43,613
- Grab on to the handles.
- Come on.

547
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:47,214
- Careful.
- Don't worry.

548
00:59:49,513 --> 00:59:52,613
Like sort of an elevator.

549
00:59:54,413 --> 00:59:56,313
- You alright?
- Yeah.

550
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:21,414
- Doug!
- What is it?

551
01:00:24,013 --> 01:00:26,513
The soldier...

552
01:00:43,114 --> 01:00:46,413
Now listen to me, Levitz,
you corrupt and evil little man.

553
01:00:46,613 --> 01:00:51,412
One of the big mysteries of history
is how Egyptian civilization began.

554
01:00:51,612 --> 01:00:54,512
How it sprang up fully clothed
on the banks of the Nile.

555
01:00:54,712 --> 01:00:58,312
Well perhaps its
origin were elsewhere.

556
01:00:58,512 --> 01:01:02,313
The answer to that is
the treasure that we seek.

557
01:01:14,912 --> 01:01:17,211
I don't like it here.

558
01:01:18,511 --> 01:01:20,113
The "sleepers shall awaken".

559
01:01:21,713 --> 01:01:24,609
- What?
- Somewhere in the blood of man.

560
01:01:25,209 --> 01:01:27,222
- What's the deal?
- I don't know.

561
01:01:27,223 --> 01:01:30,655
Well he is an expert in antiquities.
Levitz has his key.

562
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:32,915
Adam kisses ass.

563
01:01:33,763 --> 01:01:35,277
What about you?

564
01:01:40,315 --> 01:01:41,412
I'm just a channel...

565
01:01:41,612 --> 01:01:48,512
I channel messages from out there.

566
01:01:49,712 --> 01:01:52,811
Something's wrong!
Something is really wrong!

567
01:02:00,511 --> 01:02:04,510
- Doug, it's you?
- What the hell are you doing?

568
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:08,512
I'm sorry. I'm spooked.
There's something after us.

569
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:12,012
We found a soldier.
He fell.

570
01:02:18,512 --> 01:02:23,012
You're still alive.
This way.

571
01:03:06,512 --> 01:03:10,111
So many dead...
Blinded by the light.

572
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:14,212
- What did they see?
- Victims of the Sun.

573
01:03:16,511 --> 01:03:19,511
They are not human.

574
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,210
Oh my God!

575
01:03:46,911 --> 01:03:49,010
- What's up?
- I heard something.

576
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:03,111
- What the fuck is that?
- A rat.

577
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:06,111
Mr Levitz, do try
not to be hysterical.

578
01:04:06,811 --> 01:04:08,410
Just a rat.

579
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:26,511
Look at you. Like a bunch of
scared schoolboys in a graveyard.

580
01:04:26,611 --> 01:04:29,111
A little nervousness
is hardly surprising.

581
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:32,296
Some of our party
are dead, Levitz.

582
01:04:32,932 --> 01:04:34,706
Must be because of you.

583
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:39,010
Because you're jinxed.

584
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:04,110
She's getting attacked.

585
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,009
What is it?

586
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,409
What the hell is it?

587
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,605
I need you to find an exit.

588
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:53,209
No ..shh... I need to find the others.
You'll be okay. Go!

589
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:30,909
It's you!
Follow me!

590
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:41,908
Over here.
I found the door!

591
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,509
Come on!

592
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:51,509
No! No!

593
01:07:14,508 --> 01:07:16,508
Come on!

594
01:07:52,608 --> 01:07:54,207
Sahid is dead.

595
01:07:57,408 --> 01:07:59,008
Fascinating.

596
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:06,008
Fascinating? Sahid just got killed, and
you wanted Levitz to die... didn't you?

597
01:08:06,808 --> 01:08:08,608
You're not listening to me!

598
01:08:10,508 --> 01:08:12,608
- Bastard!
- Now you listen to me!

599
01:08:12,609 --> 01:08:14,409
You and your precious Levitz.

600
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:17,208
How the hell do you think
he got the Key of Heaven.

601
01:08:17,209 --> 01:08:20,409
He killed Khalfani.
He murdered him!

602
01:08:20,508 --> 01:08:21,608
The Police got the murder weapon.

603
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:25,709
Your sword stick with
your fingerprints all over it!

604
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:30,808
What was that thing over there?

605
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:32,530
What was it?

606
01:08:32,634 --> 01:08:33,973
That thing...

607
01:08:34,373 --> 01:08:38,236
Some of the ancient text
allude to a guardian who

608
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:42,123
was hidden in the pyramid
by the followers of Ra.

609
01:08:42,124 --> 01:08:44,924
It was designed to be triggered
whenever an intruder entered the tomb.

610
01:08:45,358 --> 01:08:49,508
But that will not stop me!

611
01:08:50,507 --> 01:08:57,008
- It will not stop me!
- He'll kill it like you killed my mother?

612
01:09:15,307 --> 01:09:16,306
Look.

613
01:09:21,207 --> 01:09:22,107
Look!

614
01:09:29,107 --> 01:09:30,907
It's not from here.

615
01:09:33,507 --> 01:09:37,207
And all those years my theory
has been rejected and laughed at.

616
01:09:38,106 --> 01:09:39,106
Look!

617
01:09:42,507 --> 01:09:45,400
Doug. Find me a way in.

618
01:09:47,407 --> 01:09:50,007
It's your only chance of
getting Sarah out of here.

619
01:10:00,706 --> 01:10:03,106
Do not look for the obvious.

620
01:10:05,706 --> 01:10:08,707
This inscription... Osiris.

621
01:10:08,807 --> 01:10:12,203
Sign of Osiris risen.
The sign of Osiris dead.

622
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:17,107
Right. The oldest form of the name was
written by mean of two hieroglyphics.

623
01:10:19,706 --> 01:10:23,706
One which represents the
throne and the other the eye.

624
01:10:23,906 --> 01:10:27,800
The way shall be opened
and the brow of the God

625
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,205
the great bird, Sothis.

626
01:10:29,207 --> 01:10:33,406
Sothis, was sometimes
called Sirius, the dog star.

627
01:10:33,506 --> 01:10:38,805
Sirius was the pole star seen on
the sky when the pyramids were built.

628
01:10:41,406 --> 01:10:43,506
That's it.

629
01:10:49,906 --> 01:10:51,607
Doug, hurry, please.

630
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:06,340
Sarah! Walk through the membrane.
You are the key!

631
01:11:42,505 --> 01:11:43,805
Hurry!

632
01:11:45,105 --> 01:11:47,505
Run right through the door!
Come on.

633
01:12:52,105 --> 01:12:53,405
Adam!

634
01:12:56,504 --> 01:12:59,905
This is some kind of ancient
power generator here.

635
01:13:01,903 --> 01:13:02,803
Hey!

636
01:13:04,504 --> 01:13:07,200
Back up, cowboy.
We don't need you anymore.

637
01:13:07,204 --> 01:13:09,005
No, damn it. Damn it.

638
01:13:10,704 --> 01:13:12,105
What are you doing?

639
01:13:15,205 --> 01:13:18,204
The genetic signature
of the princess Amanphur

640
01:13:18,205 --> 01:13:22,205
is preserved intact only
in the direct female bloodline.

641
01:13:22,504 --> 01:13:26,704
You are a directly descended
from Princess Amanphur.

642
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:31,504
- We need your blood
- Let her go!

643
01:13:41,304 --> 01:13:45,103
I'm okay.
I'm alright.

644
01:13:49,405 --> 01:13:50,804
Rohit...

645
01:14:03,504 --> 01:14:08,500
If your mother had cooperated,
she would have been here

646
01:14:08,503 --> 01:14:11,304
to witnessed the resurrection.

647
01:14:11,504 --> 01:14:13,404
If she had cooperated?

648
01:14:13,405 --> 01:14:15,605
She would have sat
beside me upon this throne

649
01:14:15,704 --> 01:14:20,503
to inaugurate a new era of
human history. But she refused me.

650
01:14:23,504 --> 01:14:28,603
Let the sleepless awake.

651
01:15:20,203 --> 01:15:26,303
Our knowledge of this has come down
to me through countless generations.

652
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:31,603
- For me you're going to stop this.
- No, Rohit. Come on.

653
01:15:32,204 --> 01:15:34,303
We welcome them back...

654
01:15:34,403 --> 01:15:36,603
Come on, stay with me.

655
01:15:39,503 --> 01:15:43,402
And made us in their image.

656
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:51,003
At last, mankind will
receive its full potential!

657
01:16:33,503 --> 01:16:36,102
Behold the Sun!

658
01:16:39,502 --> 01:16:45,502
Your blood unites us all.
Too late! Too late.

659
01:17:34,402 --> 01:17:36,301
Give me.

660
01:17:43,702 --> 01:17:45,401
We need to go!

661
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:42,501
Oh, my God!

662
01:19:17,201 --> 01:19:19,501
It is here.

663
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,300
You were pretty
brave back there.

664
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,800
You saved my life, thank you.

665
01:19:28,747 --> 01:19:30,465
No, thank you

666
01:19:40,201 --> 01:19:42,500
They're out there

667
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:46,500
waiting to return.

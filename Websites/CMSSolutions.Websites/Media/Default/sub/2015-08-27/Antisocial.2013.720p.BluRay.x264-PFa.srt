00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:26,081
So, first off, thanks for
stopping by my blog...

2
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:30,647
today, I'm with Tara Reiner.

3
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:31,881
Hi everyone!

4
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:36,880
She's just bought some
new clothes from the mall,

5
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,380
and we're going to go
through each of them,

6
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:39,547
and talk about them.

7
00:00:42,148 --> 00:00:45,449
This is my second favorite shirt...

8
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,481
Are you okay?

9
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:49,819
I just want to go home!

10
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:55,415
If anyone is watching this, please!

11
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:39,847
<i>Hey, you've reached Dan.</i>

12
00:02:39,848 --> 00:02:41,613
<i>Leave a message...</i>

13
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:44,546
Dan, hey.
Where are you?

14
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:46,014
I'm here.

15
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:48,447
So when you get this,
give me a call back.

16
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,746
Hey.

17
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,613
<i>Hey.</i>

18
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,546
Where are you?

19
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:38,413
Um, I'm just at Rob's.

20
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,513
Who's Rob?

21
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:41,980
You actually don't know him.

22
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,146
So, are you not coming to meet me?

23
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:48,579
Uh, I'm gonna try a little
bit later, actually.

24
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,645
<i>Who's that?</i>

25
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:53,150
Uh, she's a friend of Rob's.

26
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:57,814
Who's that girl that
posted on your page?

27
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,814
What are you talking about?

28
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:01,046
Why didn't you come
over last night?

29
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,947
I need to talk to you in person.

30
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:08,680
Um, I'm gonna try and come
over a little bit later, okay?

31
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,579
<i>Can you please get off your phone?</i>

32
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,778
Uh, one second...

33
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:14,547
Dan, are you serious?

34
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:17,378
<i>I have to tell you something.</i>

35
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:18,713
It's cool.

36
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:20,579
I'm sorry, what's cool?

37
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,946
I feel like you want
to take a break.

38
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:24,146
Okay, I get it.
I'm down with that.

39
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:26,813
<i>I was actually thinking
about the same thing.</i>

40
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:28,879
<i>It might do us both some good.</i>

41
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,378
Look, I'll call you later.

42
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,094
<i>Dan...</i>

43
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:36,947
Happy New Year's Eve, everybody.

44
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:39,346
I'm assuming that if you're here

45
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:42,547
because you didn't do
very well on your finals.

46
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:44,380
I don't want to be here either,

47
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:46,913
but we've got to do this, okay?

48
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,445
<i>So the first set of slides</i>

49
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:50,612
<i>that we're going to
go right into now</i>

50
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,180
is the Darrison Hotel crime scene.

51
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:56,354
And this time, I suggest
everybody take some notes.

52
00:06:52,214 --> 00:06:53,716
<i>Sam, are you still there?</i>

53
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:56,947
<i>Hello?</i>

54
00:06:56,948 --> 00:07:01,146
Hey, yeah. Sorry.
This kid just...

55
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:03,680
<i>How's criminology?</i>

56
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,559
I can't believe you had
class on New Year's Eve.

57
00:07:07,214 --> 00:07:09,480
Yeah, I don't know.
It was all right.

58
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:12,179
Everyone I know
has two weeks off.

59
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,545
All us medical undergrads are
working hard saving lives, okay?

60
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:15,913
We deserve our time off.

61
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:18,146
So you're coming tonight, right?

62
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:20,146
<i>Be one to remember, I promise.</i>

63
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:22,447
I don't know, Mark.

64
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:23,812
I think I'm just gonna stay in.

65
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:25,114
<i>I've had a rough day, so...</i>

66
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,846
I know, I saw.

67
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,606
<i>Of course you did.</i>

68
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:31,850
Private life is public knowledge.

69
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:35,513
I'll try to swing
by on my way home,

70
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:38,115
but I can't stay all night.

71
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,013
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

72
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,146
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

73
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,921
Hello?

74
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:43,089
Guys...

75
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,881
Ahh!

76
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:54,713
Fuck!

77
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:57,946
Oh, shit!

78
00:08:57,947 --> 00:09:00,379
Ah...

79
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,580
Yup, m-hm.

80
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:04,679
Yeah, you definitely broke my nose.

81
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,559
Serves you right, Jed.

82
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,445
All his idea.

83
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:11,447
Glad you came, Sam.

84
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,178
Sam...

85
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:26,499
I hear you're back on the market.

86
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,583
- I think you've had too much, baby.
- Shh...

87
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,213
Hi, Sam!

88
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:45,447
I don't think we've met.
I'm Kaitlin.

89
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,814
Yeah, that really backfired.

90
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:02,613
So... really single now?

91
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:10,812
Anyways, I got 300
babe tickets here,

92
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:12,414
fresh off the press.

93
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:23,846
I'm gonna go hand these
out, you comin'?

94
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:24,978
- Probably not.
- What?

95
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:27,248
Fine then.
Anyone?

96
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:31,415
Wait! Quick photo before
we're all hammered?

97
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:33,616
I'm out.

98
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:38,149
Yeah,
yeah... whoa.

99
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:44,713
Cool, I'll link everyone.

100
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:45,914
Uh, Sam...
I need to add you.

101
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,347
- What's your last name?
- I deleted my account.

102
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,181
Nice!

103
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,647
Huh?

104
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:55,713
Oh, so... how do you keep
in touch with people?

105
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:58,912
I see them in person?

106
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:00,445
Whatever, I'll link you anyway.

107
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:02,582
Okay, say cheese.

108
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,878
Your dad's in Spain?
I thought he was in Mexico.

109
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,479
I don't know anymore.

110
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,549
It's the last I heard from him.

111
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:22,348
Same old, same old.

112
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:24,480
So what happened with you and Dan?

113
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:27,415
We broke up.
Guys suck.

114
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,850
Just the ones you date.

115
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:34,278
What sucks even more

116
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,646
is that I feel like
everyone knew before me.

117
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:38,145
People posting comments,

118
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:40,246
judging me on the Social Redroom.

119
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:42,612
Things no one would ever
say that to my face,

120
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:45,045
but online it's so easy.

121
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:47,712
Whatever.

122
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:50,551
Sorry, I think I'm just tired.

123
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:57,148
Further notice, please keep
windows and doors lock...

124
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:00,812
And sites like MySocial,
and the Social Redroom

125
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,373
<i>give an unrealistic
view of the world!</i>

126
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:04,445
These are theories,
they're conspiracy theories.

127
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:05,679
I don't -
Where's the proof?

128
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,345
<i>Show me the proof.</i>

129
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:09,460
<i>It's social networking.
Eight billion pe...</i>

130
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,580
What, are you filming this?

131
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:29,179
Well, I figure one
day you'll be famous

132
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,113
and we can release a sex tape.

133
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,580
Make millions.

134
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,112
And I can just, you know,

135
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,212
live in a big house

136
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:38,579
drinking champagne for breakfast.

137
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,513
Right, right.

138
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:43,113
Oh!
Not so fast.

139
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:48,813
Well, you know,
I don't mind the teasing, but, um...

140
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:51,911
I think we'll make
more millions if, uh...

141
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:53,848
you're on the camera!

142
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:58,347
What do you want me to do?

143
00:13:58,348 --> 00:13:59,715
What are you willing to do?

144
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:03,145
I need some music.

145
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:06,182
Okay.

146
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,481

150
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,347

153
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:40,345
Today's incident has stirred
many painful memories

154
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,266
of last month's suicide

155
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,580
of 22-year old Cal Spencer

156
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:45,546
who took his life
after bullying messages

157
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:47,745
were posted on the
popular media site,

158
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:49,580
the Social Redroom Inc.

159
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:52,745
This leaves two more students
dead after today's events.

160
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:55,012
Mark...

161
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:56,449
Mark!

162
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,179
I don't know,

163
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,346
I feel like I just want to get
away for a while, you know?

164
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:02,147
Maybe just transfer.

165
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:04,445
Seriously?
Because of Dan?

166
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,413
It's not just because of Dan.

167
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:07,845
<i>Mark!</i>

168
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:09,045
I don't get you sometimes.

169
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:10,979
You're always takin' off.

170
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,146
Why don't you just
stop for a second

171
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:16,346
and try and sort it out?

172
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,112
I could help you.

173
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:20,380
<i>Yo, Marky!</i>

174
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:22,882
Would you just go see
what he's yelling about?

175
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,587
Yeah.

176
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,179
- What do you want, Jed?
- Look...

177
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,213
At approximately 4pm today,

178
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:39,112
police shot and killed
Jeremy Dubrowsky,

179
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:41,911
a two-year computer science
student at Kindred College.

180
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:44,112
This occurred immediately
following at attack by Dubrowsky

181
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:44,912
on another student,

182
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:46,480
yet to be identified.

183
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:49,145
Both students were pronounced
dead at the scene.

184
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:50,613
Police have yet to determine
Dubrowsky's motive

185
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:51,927
for attacking his fellow student,

186
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:56,046
however, early reports say
Dubrowsky was a recent target

187
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:57,345
of cyberbullying.

188
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:58,779
I saw that guy today.

189
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,146
This is just one of
four similar incidents

190
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,879
that have happened in the area
in the last few hours.

191
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,912
Although the official
causes are yet unknown,

192
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:08,380
police say the recent
increase of cyberbullying

193
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:09,957
may have played a role.

194
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,812
Ugh, come on, dude,
you're still in your dorm?

195
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:25,012
Have you seen what's going on?

196
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:26,952
About the student?
Yeah, it's brutal.

197
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:29,048
Yeah, well, that's not the
only thing that's happening.

198
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:30,978
<i>There's cops everywhere,</i>

199
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:32,313
<i>and the entire residence
is on lock-down.</i>

200
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:34,412
<i>Okay, answer this.</i>

201
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:37,454
There's something you gotta hear.

202
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:47,380
Listen...

203
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:53,382
Dude... dude,
what was that?

204
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:58,812
I've been hearing
that for the last hour.

205
00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:01,246
It's creepy as hell.

206
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:02,913
They're telling us to
keep our doors locked.

207
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:04,246
I'm gonna send you some footage...

208
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:05,945
stuff that they're
not showing on TV.

209
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:06,980
All right, well,
just get over here quick, man,

210
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:08,922
where it's safe.

211
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,446
Reports are coming in from
all across the country.

212
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:23,846
We urge people to stay indoors,
and not let anyone in.

213
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,246
Following the violent deaths

214
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:27,812
of three students
at Kindred College,

215
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,246
more details are coming

216
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:30,911
of similar incidents
across the country.

217
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:32,347
Various student suicides
and physical attacks

218
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:34,979
in Burbank, Washington
have now been reported.

219
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,845
Authorities are now urging
people to stay indoors

220
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:41,347
and to not let any strangers
inside their homes.

221
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:43,312
As more reports flood in
from around the world,

222
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,711
we at CCAC News will
continue our coverage.

223

226
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:55,813
The lights were flickering,

227
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:57,545
and I think that it's
whenever they come near,

228
00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:59,345
like, they do something weird
to the electricity or something.

We're throwing a kick-ass
New Year's party here tonight.

245
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:57,579
Anyone see the problem
with not letting people in?

246
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,012
I mean,

247
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,145
what if the world really
is ending at 12:01?

248
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:05,579
What if this the year it
finally all just... stops?

249
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,146
Don't you want to go
out with some style?

250
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,380
The world isn't ending, Jed.

All right, well, what

253
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:16,790
Jed, it's not terrorists.

254
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,651
I don't see anything.

00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:35,881

What the fuck?

261
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,080
Hey!

262
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,198
You've got two seconds
to get out, man!

263
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:21,612
Steve!

264
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:24,080
I said get out!

265
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:40,388
Steve?

266
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:57,548
Steve...

267
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:01,431
What was he doing?

268
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,921
He attacked me.

269
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,528
He didn't mean to do it.

270
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:48,911
Did you do that?

271
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:50,913
It was an accident, okay?

272
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:52,578
He smashed through the door,

273
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,078
and then Steve had to push him out,

274
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,378
and he tripped and he
fell off the balcony.

275
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:56,644
Is he dead?

276
00:21:56,645 --> 00:21:59,378
He looks pretty fucking dead.

277
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:01,611
Oh my god.

278
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,113
I barely touched him.

279
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:06,245
I told him to leave!

280
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:09,146
It looks like they're
calling the cops, now...

281
00:22:09,147 --> 00:22:11,378
- I think we call 9-1-1 right now!
- No!

282
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:14,948
It will look better if it
comes from us, all right?

283
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:18,911
Someone tried to get
in downstairs too.

284
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:21,345
Something's go on, Steve!

285
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:23,845
Yeah, they've been telling
us not to let anyone in.

286
00:22:23,846 --> 00:22:25,944
- He's dead!
- Someone tried to grab Sam!

287
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,816
And the news was saying
that we can't let anyone in!

288
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:37,180
Guys...
Listen.

289
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:39,911
<i>Due to the high volume,</i>

290
00:22:39,912 --> 00:22:41,678

<i>in or out of your homes.</i>

294
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:51,180
I've never heard a message
like that before.

295
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:54,747
9-1-1 isn't supposed to
have an answering machine!

296
00:22:55,746 --> 00:22:57,712
We've got to go down.

297
00:22:57,713 --> 00:22:59,349
It'll be okay.

298
00:23:11,578 --> 00:23:13,949
Get the lights!

299
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:18,581
Mark, what are you doing?

300
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,048
What the fuck are they shooting at?

301
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,513
Quiet!

302
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:32,578
No one gets in, right?

303
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,845
Yeah, well, that's what they said.

304
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:39,212
Mark, man...

305
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:40,511
There's a lot of people outside.

306
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:42,480
Jed, the lights!

307
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,779
Steve, you sure
picked the right night

308
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,611
to throw a dude out the window.

309
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:49,578
Okay, okay, just
keep the lights off

310
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:52,948
and try to be quiet.

311
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:55,046
Shit!

312
00:24:01,613 --> 00:24:03,679
This is gonna keep happening!

313
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,911
We've got to barricade this place!

314
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:06,112
Windows, doors, everything!

315
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:08,845
It's okay.

316
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:10,582
We need to do it now!

317
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:16,177

It's disturbing, but it's a list.

the post was sent,

on the Bloggernaut,
and the Social Redroom.

360
00:28:51,912 --> 00:28:53,712
Today I'm with Tara Reiner.

361
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:54,910
<i>Hey, everyone!</i>

362
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:57,212
Why are we watching this?

363
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:58,955
Just keep skipping
through it, okay?

364
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:12,679
Oh my god!

365
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,178
<i>Now go to when she's sitting back</i>

366
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,149
<i>in front of the web cam...</i>

367
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:35,679
<i>Her ears and her
nose started bleeding.</i>

368
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,378
She said she was seeing things,

369
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:40,348
and she was crying.

370
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:44,978
I'm too scared to leave.

371
00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:49,211
<i>I'm trying to be as
quiet as possible</i>

372
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:51,912
<i>because I hear people outside</i>

373
00:29:51,913 --> 00:29:55,612
and they sound like her.

374
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:57,878
Whatever she had,

375
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,945
I think it's happening to me.

376
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:07,378
I'm seeing things too
and they're so real...

377
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:09,777
Is there anyone watching?

378
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:12,345
Anyone, please!

379
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:13,849
<i>Help me!</i>

380
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:20,379
I can't go any further.

381
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,619
That's 'cause you're caught up.

382
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:23,145
What you're watching now is live.

383
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:24,912
I've watched this
a couple times now.

384
00:30:24,913 --> 00:30:26,991
Ears and nose bleeding seems
to be the first symptom.

385
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:31,446
Shit, I gotta go.
I'll call you right back.

386
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:34,077
Can we message her?

387
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:37,446
Yeah, we can send her a
video chat request, I guess.

388
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:41,412
Mark, get over here.

389
00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:43,462
Quick! Quick!

390
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:00,477
- Tara?
- Hello?

391
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:03,547
My name is Sam.
Are you okay?

392
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:07,811
No, I don't think so.

393
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:09,911
<i>Can you help me?</i>

394
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:12,913
Where are you?
What's your address?

395
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:17,110
I...

396
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:18,177
I don't...

397
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:21,045
I don't know.

398
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:21,810
It's not my home.

399
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:24,944
Do you have a phone?

400
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:26,178
Tara?

401
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,587
What's happening?

402
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:43,479
Yeah, there's definitely
someone outside.

403
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:51,646
- Hello?
- Chad?

404
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:53,878
The door's locked,
give me a second!

405
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:54,612
Mark! Mark!
Wait!

406
00:31:55,611 --> 00:31:57,445
Stop! Stop!

407
00:31:57,446 --> 00:31:59,112
Okay, look!
Look!

408
00:31:59,113 --> 00:32:00,580
Please look...

409
00:32:02,578 --> 00:32:04,745
Guys, it's Chad.

410
00:32:04,746 --> 00:32:06,845
<i>You've got to let me in.</i>

411
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:09,778
<i>Quick, there's nobody
out here right now.</i>

412
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,114
<i>Look, you've got to
let me in now, please.</i>

413
00:32:13,113 --> 00:32:14,512
Please let me in.

414
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:15,177
Is that Chad?

415
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:17,444
Yes.

416
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:18,177
Are you gonna let him in?

417
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:20,144
No.

418
00:32:20,145 --> 00:32:22,580
He has the symptom, man.

419
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:25,711
Okay?

420
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,512
We just watched a video.

421
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,743
First symptom,
you start seeing shit.

422
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:31,211
Hallucinations, I guess.

423
00:32:31,212 --> 00:32:33,710
Then your nose and your
ears start to bleed.

424
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:35,714
Just wait, wait!
Wait.

425
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:39,710
How do we know it's the
same thing as the video?

426
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,710
- I have to open the door.
- No.

427
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:44,411
Mark, I can hear you.

428
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:45,844
<i>You can't do this, man.</i>

429
00:32:45,845 --> 00:32:47,845
You don't know what
it's like out here.

430
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:51,378
We're not supposed to
let anyone in, remember?

431
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:52,846
Steve, a little help?

432
00:32:54,844 --> 00:32:56,479
How do you actually know
someone's sick, Jed?

433
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,378
Guys, it's Chad!

434
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:01,446
Yeah, hey...

435
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,910
His nose is bleeding, man.

436
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:07,678
His freaking ears are bleeding!

437
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,843
I love Chad, all right?
I really do.

438
00:33:09,844 --> 00:33:11,777
But I'm not going to die in here.

439
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:12,977
Chad, just a second!

440
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:15,778
They're everywhere.
Look...

441
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:16,978
You gotta let me in now, okay?

442
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:19,745
Where else is he gonna go?

443
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:23,550
Mark wait!
Stop! Stop!

444
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:29,945
He's sick.

445
00:33:29,946 --> 00:33:35,354
He is sick, man.
Okay?

446
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:45,981
I'm sorry, Chad.

447
00:33:47,979 --> 00:33:48,948
What?

448
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:53,681
I can't let you in.

449
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,844
<i>Mark, you gotta
fucking let me in, man.</i>

450
00:33:57,845 --> 00:34:00,344
Go to a hospital, Chad, please!

451
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:04,113
- You've got to fuckin' let me in!

452
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:08,743
Dude, let me in, please!

453
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:10,743
<i>I'm gonna fuckin' die out here.</i>

454
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:12,446
<i>I'm gonna fuckin' die.</i>

455
00:34:14,444 --> 00:34:17,060
Fuckin' assholes.

456
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:32,578
No help here?

457
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:34,379
<i>He almost fuckin' let him in, man!</i>

458
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,045
What the fuck am I
supposed to do, Jed?

459
00:34:38,046 --> 00:34:39,733
Fuck!

460
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:02,944
I couldn't help him.

461
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:07,711
Mark...
Mark, look at me.

462
00:35:07,712 --> 00:35:10,645
Mark, please, look at me.
Hey...

463
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:13,089
I don't know what
I could have done.

464
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,347
You okay?

465
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:35,712
I don't have it.

466
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,579
Whatever that is, I don't have it.

467
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:40,177
Sam, you just threw up.

468
00:35:40,178 --> 00:35:43,421
I'm okay, Mark.

469
00:35:52,412 --> 00:35:54,714
We'll figure this out, okay?

470
00:35:56,712 --> 00:35:59,077
I won't tell anyone in the house.

471
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:00,418
I'm not sick.

472
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:08,414
I'm pregnant.

473
00:36:11,411 --> 00:36:13,782
What?

474
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:18,410
I'm pregnant, Mark.

475
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:20,676
That's why I came here.

476
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:22,820
To tell you, I guess.

477
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:30,978
I don't know what
I'm gonna do about it.

478
00:36:30,979 --> 00:36:34,879
About it...
Wait.

479
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,146
Sam...

480
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:30,212
- I had to leave my floor!
- Why, what's happening?

481
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:32,376
- I don't know.
- Are you okay?

482
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:33,844
Yeah, I'm fine.

483
00:37:33,845 --> 00:37:35,677
They just keep telling
us to move up one floor.

484
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:37,212
It's like fucking Russian
Roulette in here.

485
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,778
- I'm fine though.
- All right, good.

486
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:42,416
<i>- Jed, I'm gonna have
to call you back!</i>

487
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:49,643
<i>Hey, you've reached Chad
Wilson, leave me a message.</i>

488
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:52,443
Hey, Chad, it's me again.

489
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:56,477
Please... call me back, man.

490
00:37:56,478 --> 00:37:57,277
Okay?

491
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:32,147
There are so many
posts of people dying.

492
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,644
Half of my friends
aren't responding...

493
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:40,378
Or their messages
don't make any sense.

494
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:41,212
I just...

495
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:44,384
I just don't know how
this many people can die.

496
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:10,581
What the hell was that?

497
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,912
Are you okay?

498
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,981
Yes.

499
00:40:18,979 --> 00:40:22,763
I think I need to lay down.

500
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:41,710
I think we need to
keep an eye on her.

501
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:43,427
That's got to be one of the symptoms.

502
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:02,711
What is she doing?

503
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:04,443
She must have got
whatever it is

504
00:41:04,444 --> 00:41:05,811
from that other girl.

505
00:41:05,812 --> 00:41:07,177
I mean, this must
be what happens next.

506
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:09,378
First you're nose
and your ears bleed...

507
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:10,944
What happens, you get violent?

508
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:14,744
Yeah, violent, you start
acting crazy, I don't know.

509
00:41:14,745 --> 00:41:16,365
I can't watch this.

510
00:41:36,345 --> 00:41:37,786
You okay?

511
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:47,446
I wonder if I have it.

512
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:50,377
How could you have gotten it?

513
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:53,788
You can't be sick.

514
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:05,344
I need help, Mark.

515
00:42:05,345 --> 00:42:06,578
Steve...

516
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:08,394
What are you talking about?

517
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:26,444
Something bad...

518
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:28,544
is gonna happen.

519
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,548
Steve, you're just being paranoid.

520
00:42:32,546 --> 00:42:34,376
Take care of Kait.

521
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:35,143
Steve...

522
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:37,511
Okay?

523
00:42:37,512 --> 00:42:39,448
I'm sorry.

524
00:42:42,445 --> 00:42:44,087
I'm sorry.

525
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,679
Mark?

526
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:02,912
<i>You're not safe, Steve.</i>

527
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,643
Mark...

528
00:43:04,644 --> 00:43:06,844
<i>When it happens,
it will be so rapid.</i>

529
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,713
<i>So fast it won't matter.</i>

530
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:11,778
<i>They're trying to stop it.</i>

531
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:13,377
I don't want to hurt them.

532
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:17,720
<i>Don't fight it, Steve.
It's already happened.</i>

533
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:34,711
Did you see?

534
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,110
Just now?

535
00:43:37,111 --> 00:43:38,846
They were just here!

536
00:43:39,845 --> 00:43:41,177
Steve, what did you see,
you're scaring me.

537
00:43:41,178 --> 00:43:44,678
Stay away!

538
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,648
Stay... away!

539
00:43:49,645 --> 00:43:51,310
He's infected.

540
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:54,211
<i>- Jed, we don't know that!
- Yeah...</i>

541
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:57,044
Come on, man.
I mean, look at him!

542
00:44:24,144 --> 00:44:26,446
Steve!

543
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:29,547
Kaitlin, get back!

544
00:44:35,978 --> 00:44:38,445
Mark!

545
00:44:43,712 --> 00:44:45,577
No, no!
Steve! Steve!

546
00:44:45,578 --> 00:44:47,619
Mark!

547
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:09,814
Steve! Steve!
No!

548
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,593
No!

549
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,380
I couldn't stop it.

550
00:45:42,177 --> 00:45:44,417
You need to get away.

551
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:50,171
Look at your hands.

552
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:58,724
Mark, you need to get away!

553
00:46:17,178 --> 00:46:20,584
Here, use this.
Put your hands...

554
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,578
Mark, whatever this is...

555
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,579
It's inside now.

556
00:46:32,578 --> 00:46:34,044
Mark...

557
00:46:34,045 --> 00:46:35,947
Mark...

558
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:40,578
That wasn't Steve, all right?

559
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:43,081
I mean,
we can agree on that, right?

560
00:46:46,078 --> 00:46:47,478
Mark...

561
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:50,346
Whoa, where are you going?

562
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:52,915
We're not leaving him there.

563
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:57,378
Fine.

564
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:59,538
But we're not touching him
unless we're wearing gloves.

565
00:47:37,744 --> 00:47:41,377
We have to figure out what to do.

566
00:47:41,378 --> 00:47:44,163
I can't stay here.

567
00:48:04,878 --> 00:48:07,953
- Mark!
- Oh fuck.

568
00:48:15,945 --> 00:48:18,582
I knew she was sick.

569
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:23,843
No! No!
She did it, she hit me!

570
00:48:23,844 --> 00:48:25,444
What?
I was just sitting there!

571
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:28,209
- You're a liar! You did!
- Maybe they both have it.

572
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,911
- Jed, are you serious?
- Sam's not sick.

573
00:48:30,912 --> 00:48:32,910
Please...

574
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,846
All right, well, what do we do now?

575
00:48:37,843 --> 00:48:39,946
I'm okay, guys, honestly.

576
00:48:40,945 --> 00:48:44,477
We tie her up.
Or she leaves.

577
00:48:44,478 --> 00:48:47,776
Mark, we can't send her outside.

578
00:48:47,777 --> 00:48:50,246
Well then we tie her up.

579
00:48:51,245 --> 00:48:52,977
- We should just bash her head in.
- Jed!

580
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:56,644
What, I'm the odd
man out on this one?

581
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:57,976
Really?
Go ahead, do it.

582
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:01,776
Don't bash my head, please.

583
00:49:01,777 --> 00:49:04,744
I wasn't being serious.

584
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:06,677
Okay, fine, maybe that
was a little harsh,

585
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:09,344
but we know what happens next!

586
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:11,476
I was just confused, okay?

587
00:49:11,477 --> 00:49:13,445
I didn't mean to call you a liar.

588
00:49:13,446 --> 00:49:14,843
You can tie me up,

589
00:49:14,844 --> 00:49:16,210
and then you'll see
that I'm not sick.

590
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:18,417
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna
go get something.

591
00:49:26,944 --> 00:49:28,578
You okay?

592
00:49:29,577 --> 00:49:30,578
I don't know...

593
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:32,517
Hey, hey, hey...

594
00:49:32,543 --> 00:49:34,846
It's gonna be okay.

595
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:39,079
I'll keep you safe.

596
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:42,581
I know.

597
00:49:45,578 --> 00:49:48,349
I'm not goin' anywhere.

598
00:49:51,346 --> 00:49:53,382
You guys are cute together.

599
00:49:57,378 --> 00:49:59,811
This was all I could find.

600
00:49:59,812 --> 00:50:01,611
We're gonna keep you
upstairs just to be safe.

601
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,776
We'll check on you.

602
00:50:03,777 --> 00:50:05,579
We just don't know what this is.

603
00:50:07,577 --> 00:50:10,344
Why?
Why upstairs?

604
00:50:10,345 --> 00:50:13,186
'Cause we don't want
to catch your crazy.

605
00:50:21,178 --> 00:50:23,544
What is that?

606
00:50:23,545 --> 00:50:24,704
<i>Do you want to be with Steve?</i>

607
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:26,781
Yes.

608
00:50:29,778 --> 00:50:32,578
Mark, look at the lights!

609
00:50:38,379 --> 00:50:40,111
Hold on to her, Jed!

610
00:50:40,112 --> 00:50:41,378
I've got her!

611
00:51:25,978 --> 00:51:28,464
Fuck...

612
00:51:48,444 --> 00:51:50,746
Fuck!

613
00:51:52,744 --> 00:51:53,909
Mark, it's not your fault.

614
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,616
I don't want to hear it, Sam!

615
00:52:00,611 --> 00:52:02,844
Just...

616
00:52:02,845 --> 00:52:04,583
Help me get her down.

617
00:52:30,445 --> 00:52:33,843
It seems the human loss count
has been more than imagined.

618
00:52:33,844 --> 00:52:36,677
At this time, the cause of
the outbreak is still unknown.

619
00:52:36,678 --> 00:52:39,643
We are going to our emergency
broadcast system at midnight.

620
00:52:39,644 --> 00:52:42,002
Our thoughts and prayers are
with the people of this planet,

621
00:52:42,377 --> 00:52:46,110
and the millions of souls
humanity has lost tonight.

622
00:52:46,111 --> 00:52:47,111
Happy New Year,

623
00:52:47,112 --> 00:52:49,146
and may God be with you.

624
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:27,143
Holy shit.

625
00:54:27,144 --> 00:54:29,879
Oh my god.
What happened to her?

626
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:33,346
Someone must have got in.

627
00:54:35,344 --> 00:54:36,977
Can you go back?

628
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:03,582
Oh my god!

629
00:55:07,578 --> 00:55:11,044
Oh my god, this is fucked up.

630
00:55:12,045 --> 00:55:14,050
This gets worse.

631
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:20,443
Well, maybe...

632
00:55:20,444 --> 00:55:23,344
maybe it's not worse.
I mean...

633
00:55:23,345 --> 00:55:24,877
They say this is a side effect,

634
00:55:24,878 --> 00:55:27,610
whatever this is that's going on.

635
00:55:27,611 --> 00:55:28,877
What if everybody that has it

636
00:55:28,878 --> 00:55:32,144
eventually... explodes and dies?

637
00:55:32,145 --> 00:55:35,277
I mean...

638
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:37,710
If that's the case,
then all we need to do is just...

639
00:55:37,711 --> 00:55:39,582
We just gotta wait it out.

640
00:55:44,577 --> 00:55:45,618
Where are you -

641
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,026
Fuck!

642
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:10,888
Mark?

643
00:56:19,879 --> 00:56:21,342
Hey...

644
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:22,579
Are you okay?

645
00:56:24,577 --> 00:56:26,176
Why are you still in here?

646
00:56:26,177 --> 00:56:28,342
<i>James Trevor, the owner and CEO</i>

647
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,775

656
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,551
No fuckin' way.

657
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:00,412
What is this?

658
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:03,850
It's our basement.

659
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:12,679
I saw something.
Before I...

660
00:58:07,878 --> 00:58:10,386
Mark, we have to go.

661
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:39,112
Come on.

662
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,442
Mark, come on.

663
00:58:42,443 --> 00:58:44,051
Why did you do that?

664
00:58:52,043 --> 00:58:53,446
Are you okay?

665
00:58:56,443 --> 00:58:59,843
I don't know.

666
00:58:59,844 --> 00:59:02,579
- Mark...
- I don't think so.

667
00:59:03,578 --> 00:59:06,409
I need you to stay with me.

668
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,714
I'm seeing things.

669
00:59:11,711 --> 00:59:13,712
What if I have it?

670
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,842
- Mark...
- Steve...

671
00:59:18,843 --> 00:59:21,049
tried to leave...
He knew.

672
00:59:26,044 --> 00:59:27,810
I need to.

673
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:31,376
Please stay.
I can't do this alone.

674
00:59:31,377 --> 00:59:32,642
Mark, please stay.

675
00:59:32,643 --> 00:59:35,613
Don't go, please!
Listen! Listen!

676
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:40,509
Please stay.

677
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,222
We've been friends forever.

678
00:59:43,545 --> 00:59:45,112
And you've always
been there for me.

679
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:48,246
I don't know...

680
00:59:50,244 --> 00:59:53,677
I don't know if I ever told
you how much that means.

681
00:59:53,678 --> 00:59:56,576
Maybe I didn't tell you, but...

682
00:59:56,577 --> 00:59:59,845
You mean everything to me.

683
01:00:01,844 --> 01:00:04,142
It's like I pushed everyone away.

684
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:07,180
Maybe I pushed you
away too, I don't know.

685
01:00:10,177 --> 01:00:11,975
Maybe I...

686
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:15,712
Maybe I've been really far...

687
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:18,911
And I'm really sorry.

688
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,980
But right now I'm
asking you to stay.

689
01:00:26,977 --> 01:00:30,847
And it's because I need you.

690
01:00:32,845 --> 01:00:34,615
I really need you.

691
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:43,643
You don't understand.

692
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:47,476
I can feel it inside of me.

693
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,942
Mark, you don't have it.

694
01:00:48,943 --> 01:00:52,380
You're fine, you don't have it.

695
01:00:54,378 --> 01:00:56,379
Mark, please!

696
01:00:57,378 --> 01:00:59,579
Mark!

697
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:18,444
Stay back.

698
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:20,910
What are you doing?

699
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:24,875
You need to get away from him, Sam.

700
01:01:24,876 --> 01:01:28,343
You've been on it, right, Mark?

701
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:29,610
On what?

702
01:01:29,611 --> 01:01:31,577
Jed, put down the knife.

703
01:01:31,578 --> 01:01:33,477
I know what it is.

704
01:01:33,478 --> 01:01:34,710
All right, I know what it is,

705
01:01:34,711 --> 01:01:37,713
I know why people are getting sick.

706
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:43,409
There's a video...
will you watch it?

707
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:44,743
Jed, I need to leave -

708
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:46,063
I need you to watch it, all right?

709
01:01:46,843 --> 01:01:49,712
Yeah?
Okay.

710
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,876
If anybody out there is listening,

711
01:01:59,877 --> 01:02:01,243
please, you have to
believe me when I tell you

712
01:02:01,244 --> 01:02:02,942
that the Social Redroom is to blame.

713
01:02:02,943 --> 01:02:06,509
It is the cause for
this whole epidemic.

714
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,909
For the past three years...

715
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:11,209
we have been running...

716
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:14,210
a subliminal pattern
underneath our website,

717
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:18,175
trying to get users to visit
the website more frequently.

718
01:02:18,176 --> 01:02:21,509
It was impossible for us to
track the billions of users,

719
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,210
so we...

720
01:02:23,211 --> 01:02:25,643
we created a program
to do it for us.

721
01:02:25,644 --> 01:02:27,610
We're supposed to believe this?

722
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:29,142
Keep watching.

723
01:02:29,143 --> 01:02:30,876
This is the reason
why you feel the need

724
01:02:30,877 --> 01:02:34,975
to add more photos,
to update statuses,

725
01:02:34,976 --> 01:02:37,976
to, uh, um... browse more often.

726
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:40,976
And the update that
we released this morning...

727
01:02:40,977 --> 01:02:44,842
Well, that is highly
more addictive.

728
01:02:44,843 --> 01:02:46,943
The occasional nosebleed
was the only symptom, but...

729
01:02:46,944 --> 01:02:52,509
they kept the real
side effects a secret.

730
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,409
Oh, god...

731
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,510
hallucinations, and depression,

732
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,376
and violence, you know?

733
01:02:58,377 --> 01:02:59,908
All kept a secret.

734
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:02,809
After hearing about the
side effects, I, uh...

735
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:03,769
I tried to shut it down.

736
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:06,143
But it, uh...

737
01:03:06,144 --> 01:03:08,576
It went into some
sort of survival mode.

738
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:09,711
Like a biological virus.

739
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,945
It mutated, it started
to change people.

740
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:20,577
The virus is moving through
those its infected.

741
01:03:20,578 --> 01:03:23,443
It's trying to
eliminate the threat -

742
01:03:23,444 --> 01:03:25,376
which is us.

743
01:03:25,377 --> 01:03:31,676
If you are experiencing
nosebleeds or hallucinations...

744
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:33,542
There's no hope for you.

745
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,377
But I have posted a link

746
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:41,175
for those that aren't
experiencing that, okay?

747
01:03:41,176 --> 01:03:44,380
It's risky,
but it might work for you.

748
01:03:46,378 --> 01:03:47,881
I am so sorry.

749
01:03:51,877 --> 01:03:54,412
Jed, this can't be true.

750
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:57,712
Think about it.

751
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:03,610
How else could a virus
spread worldwide in a day?

752
01:04:03,611 --> 01:04:05,842
A fucking day!

753
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:07,142
Billions of people sick

754
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,443
on all different
continents in one night!

755
01:04:09,444 --> 01:04:10,841
I was all right there, Sam!

756
01:04:10,842 --> 01:04:12,376
You need to get away
from him, all right?

757
01:04:12,377 --> 01:04:14,043
Just come over here.

758
01:04:14,044 --> 01:04:15,742
You...

759
01:04:15,743 --> 01:04:17,375
I'm sorry, Mark.

760
01:04:17,376 --> 01:04:19,383
Come here, Sam.

761
01:04:24,378 --> 01:04:26,378
I was on it.

762
01:04:27,377 --> 01:04:29,176
What?

763
01:04:29,177 --> 01:04:33,444
No, you deleted it,
you told us that you deleted it.

764
01:04:33,445 --> 01:04:36,376
Jed, I was just on it upstairs.

765
01:04:36,377 --> 01:04:37,846
<i>Please, Sam!</i>

766
01:04:39,844 --> 01:04:41,914
Fuck.

767
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:48,309
You're saying that
'cause of him, right?

768
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:51,410
You don't need to
protect him, all right?

769
01:04:51,411 --> 01:04:52,813
Just come over...
Come over here.

770
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:59,376
I don't want to be alone.

771
01:04:59,377 --> 01:05:01,544
Please!
Please?

772
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,310
There's a cure.

773
01:05:06,311 --> 01:05:09,209
There might be,
there might be a cure.

774
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,176
There might be, there's a link.

775
01:05:11,177 --> 01:05:14,042
- What?
- What are you talking about?

776
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,143
Well, what is it?

777
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:18,480
Get the fuck back!

778
01:05:21,477 --> 01:05:24,709
- The drill's downstairs.
- What are you talking about?

779
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:26,444
I will show you!

780
01:05:26,445 --> 01:05:29,477
Okay.

781
01:05:29,478 --> 01:05:30,844
Okay...

782
01:05:35,544 --> 01:05:36,577
Brian?

783
01:05:37,576 --> 01:05:39,075
Brian!

784
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:41,875
Dude, where are you?

785
01:05:43,876 --> 01:05:46,345
Brian...

786
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:48,810
I watched it.

787
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,443
I watched the links,
you were right, dude.

788
01:05:50,444 --> 01:05:52,408
What's going on?

789
01:05:52,409 --> 01:05:55,177
Residence is overrun.

790
01:05:55,178 --> 01:05:57,476
You all right?
Just come over here, man.

791
01:05:57,477 --> 01:06:00,442
I'm trapped on the roof.

792
01:06:00,443 --> 01:06:02,143
Well, is there a fire escape?

793
01:06:02,144 --> 01:06:04,744
Just look for a fire
escape, man, all right?

794
01:06:05,743 --> 01:06:08,212
Don't come any closer!

795
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:11,608
- I gotta sign off.
- No! You don't!

796
01:06:12,575 --> 01:06:13,578
You gotta wait it out!

797
01:06:14,577 --> 01:06:16,142
No, Jed.

798
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:17,643
That's it, man,
you just gotta wait it out.

799
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:19,708
They're dying off, I promise you!

800
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,581
I know.
There's no more time.

801
01:06:25,577 --> 01:06:29,143
Sorry to be a downer
on your party, man.

802
01:06:29,144 --> 01:06:30,383
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

803
01:06:35,777 --> 01:06:38,410
Yeah, well...

804
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,575
The party kind of sucked anyway.

805
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:42,379
I gotta go.

806
01:06:44,377 --> 01:06:48,476
Brian?
Brian!

807
01:06:48,477 --> 01:06:50,579
He can't hear me.
He can't hear me.

808
01:06:52,577 --> 01:06:54,576
Brian!

809
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:57,908
Please!

810
01:06:57,909 --> 01:07:00,143
Brian, please, please!

811
01:07:00,144 --> 01:07:02,978
Brian, no, no!

812
01:07:07,576 --> 01:07:10,043
No!

813
01:07:15,876 --> 01:07:17,343
Jed!

814
01:07:17,344 --> 01:07:18,712
Jed, don't!

815
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:31,143
I'm sorry...

816
01:07:31,144 --> 01:07:32,444
Jed!

817
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,710
Hold the door!

818
01:08:20,111 --> 01:08:21,515
Fuck!

819
01:08:44,577 --> 01:08:46,758
Where's the link?

820
01:09:00,744 --> 01:09:02,822
What you are about to see
is a procedure that we feel

821
01:09:03,409 --> 01:09:06,542
might be the cure for
what they are calling

822
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:08,543
the 'Redroom Virus'.

823
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:12,476
<i>This virus attacks the
amygdala area of the brain,</i>

824
01:09:12,477 --> 01:09:15,310
<i>which stimulates an
over-production of cells</i>

825
01:09:15,311 --> 01:09:18,609
<i>which creates a new kind of brain</i>

826
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:19,569
<i>in the form of a tumor.</i>

827
01:09:20,376 --> 01:09:23,244
<i>This is to accommodate
the overwhelming number</i>

828
01:09:23,245 --> 01:09:26,842
of new signals the
brain is receiving

829
01:09:26,843 --> 01:09:32,842
from others infected by the
Social Redroom dot com.

830
01:09:32,843 --> 01:09:34,377
<i>It is this increase in brain mass</i>

831
01:09:35,376 --> 01:09:39,177
<i>that is causing these hallucinations.</i>

832
01:09:49,211 --> 01:09:51,375
<i>From our limited research,</i>

833
01:09:51,376 --> 01:09:54,142
if you are already
experiencing hallucinations,

834
01:09:54,143 --> 01:09:56,776
this surgery will not help you.

835
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:58,810
It means that the tumor

836
01:09:58,811 --> 01:10:03,045
is already too deeply entrenched.

837
01:10:06,477 --> 01:10:08,209
Before you begin,

838
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:10,041
<i>make sure that your patient is</i>

839
01:10:10,042 --> 01:10:15,575
immobilized, secured to a
chair or a table with a rope.

840
01:10:15,876 --> 01:10:17,482
Or a belt will suffice.

841
01:10:23,476 --> 01:10:26,374
First, make an incision

842
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,375
at the pre-frontal cortex,

843
01:10:28,376 --> 01:10:30,593
either here or here.

844
01:10:46,577 --> 01:10:48,443
Once you have exposed the skull,

845
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:49,876
you'll need to drill a small hole

846
01:10:49,877 --> 01:10:51,978
large enough for a hobby knife.

847
01:10:52,977 --> 01:10:57,144
And be careful not to drill too deep.

848
01:10:58,143 --> 01:11:00,541
This is the most important part:

849
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:02,342
Once the hole is drilled,

850
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:04,175
a black artery will appear.

851
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:06,709
This is the artery
that feeds the tumor,

852
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:10,476
and accelerates the growth.

853
01:11:10,477 --> 01:11:12,843
This increase in brain mass

854
01:11:12,844 --> 01:11:16,176
is the eventual cause
of the skull bursting.

855
01:11:16,177 --> 01:11:20,375
Even after death, the
tumor continues to grow.

856
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:23,051
We don't know why or how.

857
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:49,581
This is what you've removed.

858
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,576
That's in our heads?

859
01:11:56,577 --> 01:11:58,478
Is this possible?

860
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:02,275
What?
No.

861
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,842
It's brain surgery with
a household drill, no.

862
01:12:05,843 --> 01:12:07,709
You heard what he said.

863
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:09,341
We'll die anyway.

864
01:12:09,342 --> 01:12:12,442
We can't do this.

865
01:12:12,443 --> 01:12:13,909
We have to.

866
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:15,341
I'm not drilling a hole
in your head, Sam!

867
01:12:15,342 --> 01:12:16,679
That's insane!

868
01:12:19,676 --> 01:12:22,013
Mark, we can do this.

869
01:12:55,443 --> 01:12:57,882
I'm sorry, Sam.

870
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:05,409
I can't.

871
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:06,579
I'm sick.

872
01:13:09,576 --> 01:13:11,410
Please don't...

873
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:14,415
Please don't make me do this.

874
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,779
Okay, then I'll do you first.

875
01:13:23,777 --> 01:13:26,408
If the video's right,
then it's too late for me.

876
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:27,674
Look at me.

877
01:13:27,675 --> 01:13:29,712
We're not gonna die down here!

878
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:33,045
What if it doesn't work?

879
01:13:36,043 --> 01:13:37,812
It has to.

880
01:13:40,809 --> 01:13:43,141
We don't have much time.

881
01:13:44,242 --> 01:13:47,052
We have to do this.

882
01:14:17,043 --> 01:14:18,378
Hey...

883
01:14:20,376 --> 01:14:24,142
If something goes wrong...

884
01:14:24,143 --> 01:14:27,675
it's okay.

885
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:29,915
There's no other way.

886
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:08,376
What you are about to see

887
01:15:08,377 --> 01:15:11,409
is a procedure that we
feel might be the cure

888
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:14,144
for what they are calling
the 'Redroom Virus'...

889
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:17,378
Bite into this.

890
01:15:19,376 --> 01:15:22,142
<i>Which stimulates the
overproduction of cells,</i>

891
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,376

<i>new signals the brain is

897
01:15:41,576 --> 01:15:43,376
<i>She's going to die, Mark.</i>

898
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:45,913
<i>Why are you fighting us?</i>

899
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:50,584
What?

900
01:15:57,577 --> 01:16:01,579
Okay, are you ready?

901
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:43,943
Mark...

902
01:17:02,543 --> 01:17:04,144
You can feel it, Mark.

903
01:17:05,143 --> 01:17:08,445
Chad?

904
01:17:10,443 --> 01:17:12,247
How we're all connected now.

905
01:17:15,244 --> 01:17:19,709
Everyone knows
everything about you.

906
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:21,882
And you know everything
about everyone else.

907
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,177
If you listen to us...

908
01:17:31,176 --> 01:17:34,478
we can save you.

909
01:17:36,476 --> 01:17:38,109
Your pain...

910
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:40,380
will be our pain.

911
01:17:43,377 --> 01:17:44,974
You're not really here.

912
01:17:44,975 --> 01:17:49,907
If you operate on
her, she will die.

913
01:17:49,908 --> 01:17:51,117
No.

914
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:01,446
Mark, focus on me.

915
01:18:05,442 --> 01:18:07,347
Ah...

916
01:18:11,343 --> 01:18:12,576
Mark!

917
01:19:15,176 --> 01:19:18,380
Mark!

918
01:19:22,376 --> 01:19:24,075
Please don't leave me.

919
01:19:24,076 --> 01:19:25,343
Not you.

920
01:19:26,342 --> 01:19:28,408
I can't do it.

921
01:19:28,409 --> 01:19:31,477
Get... get out.

922
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,143
Mark...

923
01:19:35,142 --> 01:19:37,576
Mark, I can't do this alone.

924
01:19:37,577 --> 01:19:40,117
You're not alone.

925
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:48,347
I love you.

926
01:19:52,343 --> 01:19:54,582
I love you too, Sam.

927
01:20:00,576 --> 01:20:03,343
Mark...

928
01:20:03,344 --> 01:20:04,176
Mark!

929
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:05,907
<i>Law enforcement officials...</i>

930
01:26:05,908 --> 01:26:09,674
<i>infected seem to
be coming back...</i>

931
01:26:09,675 --> 01:26:11,609
<i>has shut down networking sites...</i>

932
01:26:16,508 --> 01:26:18,308
<i>will continue to keep
you informed by radio</i>

933
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:20,144
<i>as long as it's safe...</i>

934
01:26:22,142 --> 01:26:24,301
<i>The brain hemorrhage did
not kill all the infected...</i>

935
01:26:26,243 --> 01:26:28,442
<i>telepathic bond between the dead.</i>

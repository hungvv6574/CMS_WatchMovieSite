1
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,999
What is this barrier? It's new.

2
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Passage must be granted by the
princess or the young baron.

3
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,999
The old one is dead?

4
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,499
That's a pity.

5
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,999
Are the horses yours? You need a permit.

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,999
A permit? I've passed this way
twenty times without a permit.

7
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You won't pass without a permit.

8
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You need a permit, or you can
go back where you came from.

9
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm taking them to the fair.

10
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll let you have them for thirty.

11
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I've already lowered my price.

12
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I bought them for twenty
pounds only a month ago.

13
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,499
He can't pass. He has no permit.

14
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,999
So you'll make use of
this story of a permit?

15
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Then leave us something - the
horses, the two glossy black ones.

16
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,499
He'll get them back when he gets a permit.

17
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,000
My horses? That's ridiculous.
I have to sell them.

18
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Agreed. Leave the black ones.

19
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
César, look after the
horses until I return.

20
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Where are the horses?

21
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,000
The two black ones that were there.

22
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,999
Kohlhaas.

23
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,500
Governor.

24
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
Magnificent.

25
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,000
He's superb.

26
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,500
He is truly exceptional. I
don't know how you do it.

27
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Any other merchant would have
kept him for himself, but you...

28
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,500
You're going to drive me a
hard bargain, aren't you?

29
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,500
What are you doing there?

30
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,000
Who gave you permission to take them out?

31
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Thief.

32
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
Release the dogs.

33
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Isn't that the Bible?

34
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You don't read aloud?

35
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Is it the Bible. But not in Latin.

36
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Would you like to read?

37
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Through... a... glass... darkly

38
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Through a glass, darkly.

39
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,000
It's an image.

40
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,000
A way of seeing the world.

41
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Darkly.

42
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,000
Something that you see,
but don't recognise.

43
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
An enemy.

44
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,500
Or a friend.

45
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Or oneself.

46
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I have something for you.

47
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
I don't dare look.

48
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,000
You know what I thought,
the first time I saw you?

49
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,499
If only I could touch that man...

50
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
...just once.

51
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,000
He is so handsome...

52
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,500
...I would drink his tenderness
from a pig's trough.

53
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,000
You're blushing.

54
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,000
Are you going to make love?

55
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,000
Mother says I'm not allowed to pretend
to be asleep when I hear you.

56
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,000
I heard you.

57
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,499
Who did this?

58
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,799
Where is my manservant?

59
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,999
He left.

60
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,500
We looked after the horses ourselves.
We worked them to pay for their keep.

61
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,499
What happened to him?

62
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,999
He ran off with the horses.
That's what happened.

63
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So we caught the horses, but he got away.

64
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,500
I don't believe you.

65
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,500
Well, there it is. Believe what you like.

66
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm here for my horses, my lord.

67
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,999
Two sable black horses

68
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,499
that were left with you as a guarantee.

69
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,999
They're in the stable.

70
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,999
He just saw them.

71
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,500
He's making a big fuss because
they're dirty and we made them work.

72
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Those are not my horses.

73
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,499
I left you two magnificent animals

74
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,000
well-fed and in good health.

75
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,500
I want my horses as they were.

76
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,000
My lord! The princess no
longer grants toll privileges.

77
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,999
You mocked me.

78
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Now I want my horses.

79
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I will go to the court, my lord.

80
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,000
Why exactly are you giving me this money?

81
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,000
Show him.

82
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,000
I want you to bring a
suit before the tribunal.

83
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,000
Demand reparation for the damages
suffered by myself and César.

84
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,999
The right of toll collection
no longer exists.

85
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The chancellery confirmed it.

86
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,500
César has always been in my service.

87
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,500
They set the dogs on him.

88
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,500
I leave it to you to estimate
the cost of the damages.

89
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And say that I want my horses as they were.

90
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,000
Well-fed and in perfect health.

91
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's a colt.

92
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
It's your horse.

93
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,000
Watch.

94
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,500
He's going to stand up.

95
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,999
I've returned from the tribunal.

96
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Your suit was rejected.

97
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,500
This is the third time.
There won't be another.

98
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,000
The baron who wronged you...

99
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
He's the relative of a
gentleman of the court.

100
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I counsel you to go and
retrieve your horses.

101
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,500
Why do you not dismount?

102
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,999
I can't stay.

103
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I must be off again.

104
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,000
Will you not have something to eat?

105
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,000
Please...

106
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Don't press me.

107
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,000
So it ends here?

108
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,000
Kohlhaas...

109
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,499
Is your business so fragile that it
can't stand the loss of two horses?

110
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,499
Why do you not answer?

111
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,999
Go and get your horses -

112
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Which horses?

113
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,999
Those half dead beasts

114
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
that I left there three months ago?

115
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,000
I would prefer that you
leave me out of this.

116
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Mother, come see.

117
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,499
We acknowledge the suit brought by the horse
merchant, Michael Kohlhaas, against his lord.

118
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,499
We judge that said lord, to whom he left
his horses, is in no way detaining them

119
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,549
and he may send to retrieve
them or else designate

120
00:26:43,575 --> 00:26:46,025
a place where the lord
may deliver them.

121
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,123
We further deem Michael Kohlhaas a
vexatious litigant and instruct

122
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:55,025
him to trouble the chancellery
no further with such complaints

123
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
on pain of imprisonment.

124
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
You're selling land?

125
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,000
If you buy right now, I won't
haggle over the price.

126
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,000
How much will you give me for all of it?

127
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,999
All of what?

128
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,999
Everything.

129
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
The land. The house.

130
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,000
Is it true what César said?

131
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,000
That you want to take your
suit to the princess?

132
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,000
That you're selling the house?

133
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,000
Are you getting rid of us?

134
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Judith.

135
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
God gave me a wife...

136
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,000
children...

137
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,000
whom I love more than anything.

138
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,500
You want me to regret that for
the first time in my life?

139
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,000
What should I do?

140
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Offer my excuses to the baron?

141
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Give me the suit.

142
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,799
Let me go.

143
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,499
Judith...

144
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,499
There is an entourage around the princess.

145
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,000
Which you plan to infiltrate how?

146
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,999
With a sword?

147
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The entourage around the
princess is a court.

148
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If you really want your
grievance to be heard...

149
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,999
My love...

150
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Let me go.

151
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,499
Go back on foot with the mare.

152
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
I'll go faster without you.

153
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Lord...

154
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Lord of lords

155
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,000
You who knows the thoughts of humankind

156
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,499
Creator of thunder, of lightning, of fog

157
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,700
of the wind, the snow, and the rain

158
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You who creates impermanent beings, who
maintains them and nourrishes them

159
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,500
Receive the soul of Judith.

160
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Receive the soul of Judith.

161
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,000
Sprinkle her with the dew of Thy Grace.

162
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,499
Sprinkle her with the dew of Thy Grace.

163
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,000
Beneath the shade of Thy wings.

164
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Beneath the shade of Thy wings.

165
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Lord, there is much sorrow for Judith.

166
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Lord...

167
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Let her dwell with You.

168
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Amen.

169
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,999
I can stay here in the house.

170
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Lisbeth.

171
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,500
When it's all over, I'll come back for you.

172
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,000
I promise you.

173
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Giddyup.

174
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
The Bible tells us to forgive our enemies.

175
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,999
I pray to God... that He never
grant us such forgiveness

176
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
as we will give our dog of a lord.

177
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,000
Get dressed.

178
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,000
Put it down.

179
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,000
Take this.

180
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
The baron is on foot.
He can't have gone far.

181
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,999
They want to follow us.

182
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
What do you say?

183
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:17,037
So I've come, Sir Kohlhaas

184
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,998
and I give you my respects.

185
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,920
A single man and his horse
against the entire world.

186
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,590
That's very strong!

187
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,425
I've also...

188
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:34,000
I've also broken the law.

189
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,770
Listen, listen! I've also broken the law.

190
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,105
Sometimes. Like all men.

191
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:48,234
I want to say... if there is a just God...

192
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,570
I'm not sure what will happen.

193
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:54,449
If I weigh on one side of the scales

194
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,242
what I did

195
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,161
and on the other side

196
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,996
what was done to me...

197
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,248
Look, look!

198
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,752
Look, we've reached Sir Kohlhaas.

199
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,235
It's for you.

200
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:33,238
You'll have to wait a little,
but he'll fatten up.

201
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,500
How much did you pay?

202
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,999
No, no, no. Nothing. It's a gift.

203
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,999
Kohlhaas doesn't accept gifts.

204
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
We'll pay you.

205
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,000
Who here knows how to fight?

206
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,500
And who has gone to war before?

207
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:17,500
Do you know what the lord
does to peasants who revolt?

208
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,000
They cut off your fingers.

209
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,000
They put out your eyes.

210
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,000
They torture you slowly.

211
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It lasts a day.

212
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,000
The death of a peasant is a joke.

213
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,000
I was a soldier.

214
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,000
I know what I'm talking about.

215
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,499
You, the big one, you'll come with me.

216
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,000
The rest of you, go home.

217
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,500
Er, I...

218
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,500
I... I can fight.

219
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Show me.

220
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,925
I want to learn.

221
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,429
I have to see Sir Kohlhaas.

222
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,308
It's important.

223
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You brought the pig. I haven't forgotten.

224
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,500
The baron...

225
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,200
The baron...

226
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,078
I know where he is.

227
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,999
When I was a child, a rebellion broke out

228
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,499
in a neighbouring province
a little distance away.

229
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,999
And one day, a beggar who had
passed through that province

230
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,800
brought into my father's
house a rebel's manifesto.

231
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,999
It was a feast day.

232
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
There were guests in every room.

233
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,999
The priest read out the first article

234
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
and everyone started to laugh.

235
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,999
My father tore up the manifesto

236
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,999
and chased off the beggar,
beating him with a stick.

237
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,499
Why?

238
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,500
The peasants complained,
in those twelve articles

239
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,499
that they counted as less than our dogs.

240
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,999
I was twelve years old.

241
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
The great peasant rebellion
took place a month later.

242
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,999
My father lost his life.

243
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Three of our family's manors
were burned and demolished.

244
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,499
Tell the governor that this was the
most discreet thing I could find.

245
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,000
Hurry, and speak to no one.

246
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,000
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

247
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Flowers are blooming on Judith's grave.

248
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Thank you.

249
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,999
The neighbour doesn't
want the house anymore.

250
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
He's looking after it for you.

251
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,000
You can buy back the land when you want to.

252
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,000
You know I can't stay with you.

253
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,000
I know.

254
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,000
What do you want me to do?

255
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,500
Go home.

256
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,000
What are you going to do with her?

257
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,000
She's my daughter.

258
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,500
Any news from home?

259
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
No one is judging you.

260
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
There's not one word against you.

261
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And you?

262
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,500
How do you judge me?

263
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
The baron has just left the abbey.

264
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,000
Is it for mother that you're going to war?

265
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,000
No.

266
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,000
For the horses?

267
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
No.

268
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,000
César!

269
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,000
Two squads.

270
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,500
Eighteen men.

271
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,000
My men.

272
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
We do not take.

273
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,000
We buy.

274
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
We pay

275
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,000
the one who owns.

276
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,500
And we accept no donations.

277
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
People give because they're afraid.

278
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
War does not give us the right.

279
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,500
Demanding tolls...

280
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,000
Stealing...

281
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,000
That is what the lord does.

282
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,000
That is not what we do.

283
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,000
Come forward.

284
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,000
Your house was pillaged.

285
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,000
Show me the one responsible.

286
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,000
Do you have anything to say?

287
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
That's your idea of justice?

288
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Hanging your own men?

289
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:37,000
That's why you burn and massacre?

290
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
It seem as though you are preparing
to ravage an entire town.

291
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:56,000
All these people you're leading to war...

292
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:00,000
Do they know what awaits them?

293
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,000
What did you tell them?

294
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:19,500
That Kohlhaas was the victim
of a great injustice?

295
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,500
You're a merchant.

296
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,500
You're business is prosperous.

297
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
For you, life is easy.

298
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,500
What effort did you make to obtain justice?

299
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Me, I see that your heart is corrupted.

300
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,000
That you are leading all these people

301
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,000
into a war that doesn't concern them.

302
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,000
I see that the sword that you wield
is not the sword of justice.

303
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,000
That you are not a soldier of God.

304
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,499
God... has been largely forgotten

305
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:13,000
throughout this entire story.

306
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,500
Kohlhaas...

307
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:22,000
What awaits you on earth is the gallows.

308
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:30,000
And all of you? You know
very well what awaits you.

309
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:35,000
It's an honour to meet you.

310
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,700
You know me?

311
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,500
I read your Bible

312
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
and I read it to my children.

313
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,700
If everyone acted as you do

314
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
there would be no order, no justice.

315
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,700
And you...

316
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,700
What would you do if, among your own troops

317
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,999
each one wanted to be independent,
to take justice into his own hands

318
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
and seek vengeance for himself?

319
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,741
You would say that it is a
higher power that must judge.

320
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:18,000
That no one may be the
judge of his own cause.

321
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,999
God would help you

322
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
if you knew how to suffer
as He asks of you.

323
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:30,500
If you learned to endure
and to bear injustice.

324
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,772
Do you not know that it
does not befit a Christian

325
01:13:33,798 --> 01:13:36,025
to fight with the sword
and the arquebus

326
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,000
but with the cross and with patience?

327
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:45,500
That his triumph is neither
domination nor power

328
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
but submission and humility?

329
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,500
I've spent my life convincing
the Church and the princes

330
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,500
that they had no reason to fear us.

331
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,500
That all we asked was to be allowed
to live and prosper alongside them.

332
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,700
Your rebellion

333
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
has only set back our cause.

334
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,000
The woman...

335
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
that I loved

336
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,500
who carried my children

337
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:32,000
went to the palace of the princess

338
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,500
to beg

339
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
that I be given the justice
that was my right.

340
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,000
Lay down your arms.

341
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,500
If the baron looks after my horses...

342
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,999
In the name of your faith,
and that of your children!

343
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,600
...with his own hands.

344
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,000
...of all children raised
by our principles!

345
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,500
If he returns my horses
to me in good health

346
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,500
I will lay down my arms.

347
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,500
And if not?

348
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,000
You say that you grieve
the loss of your wife.

349
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,000
That you are inconsolable.

350
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,500
Don't you know that there
are ways to defeat death?

351
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Every living species has them.

352
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:02,000
From an ant to a man.

353
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,500
You...

354
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,000
You have the most simple.

355
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Do not kill.

356
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Death is a choice.

357
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:21,000
He who does not kill, does not die.

358
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,000
What you must consider today

359
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,500
is not your strength, which is great.

360
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It is not the wrong of your
adversary, which is undeniable.

361
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,999
I am only asking you to examine

362
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
if what you are about to do
is in accordance with justice

363
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
and with your own conscience.

364
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,620
It's a fine thing to
speak to the unfortunate

365
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:59,525
with words that fly like arrows.

366
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,500
Does it not occur to you
to think of your own end?

367
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,500
Of the child that you'll leave behind?

368
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Of the reflections that
will be lost to you?

369
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,799
Don't forget;

370
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,500
we die alone.

371
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
You've had this all along.

372
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,000
The princess is negotiating.

373
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,500
Not me.

374
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,000
I don't ask anything more
than what is written there.

375
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,300
I would prefer that you agree
with the spirit of the writing

376
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,000
rather than the princess' terms.

377
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,000
Will you hear my confession?

378
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,000
Get down on your knees.

379
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:38,000
Are you prepared to forgive your enemy

380
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,500
to go and retrieve your horses

381
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
and to bring them home to care for them?

382
01:18:55,500 --> 01:19:03,000
I am prepared to forgive those
who wronged me unknowingly.

383
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,500
But...

384
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,000
The baron...

385
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:16,000
Let me demand that he restore
my horses with his own hands.

386
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,000
Pastor

387
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,999
Do you deny me peace?

388
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,500
With God, yes.

389
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
With the princess, it's in your hands.

390
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:55,500
The Princess of Angoulême, Queen
of Navarre, sister of the king

391
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,800
accords Michael Kohlhaas right of passage

392
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
so that his case may be tried anew

393
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
on condition that he lay down his arms.

394
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,000
Should the tribunal dismiss his suit

395
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:24,500
Kohlhaas will submit himself to the law for
having taken justice into his own hands.

396
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,800
On the contrary, should the tribunal
find that he is in the right

397
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,999
he and his troops shall be pardonned

398
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,612
and he will be granted
amnesty for the extortions

399
01:20:35,638 --> 01:20:39,025
of which he
is guilty in the land.

400
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,500
I saw injustice. That
is why I took up arms.

401
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
They will have my arms. I'll fight no more.

402
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,000
Everyone return home.

403
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
No one will die today.

404
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,500
And those who are already dead?

405
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,000
And César?

406
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Amnesty!

407
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:18,000
Surrender your arms!

408
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,500
We surrender our arms!

409
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Everyone!

410
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Have you turned in your weapons?

411
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,500
I did.

412
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,500
Do you have children?

413
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,500
No.

414
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,500
A wife?

415
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,500
No.

416
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
You've kept back nothing? You're certain?

417
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,000
I have nothing left.

418
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,500
That's good.

419
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,000
I don't know where to go.

420
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:24,000
Do you know where Jérémie is?

421
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,000
Do you know where he's going?

422
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,000
Michael Kohlhaas?

423
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,000
Your Majesty.

424
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,000
Do you know who I am?

425
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,000
My father called you "majesty".

426
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:44,000
It was in my palace that
your mother was injured.

427
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Would you believe me if I
told you that I am sorry?

428
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,200
Do you believe it is my fault?

429
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
The town that you were preparing to destroy
before you surrendered your arms...

430
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,000
I was there.

431
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I had not as many men as you.

432
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
You could have taken by your own power
much more, so why did you surrender?

433
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I don't want more, Majesty.
Only what is owed to me.

434
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:55,000
You are a fanatic.

435
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,500
I have principles.

436
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
A relative of the baron's used his
position to make your suit disappear.

437
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,000
Did you know?

438
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,000
Yes.

439
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
You are like me.

440
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
You live as much by the love
as by the fear you inspire.

441
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,500
If you inspire only fear,
everyone despises you.

442
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,000
Only love...

443
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,000
and it is sign of weakness.

444
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:43,000
But I doubt you are alone.

445
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,000
You have armies.

446
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:48,500
You have a child.

447
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I would like you to accept a guard.

448
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,460
Your Majesty, I don't...

449
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,000
Men... for your protection.

450
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,000
Until the trial.

451
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,000
The baron may have found your horses.

452
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,300
In a poor state, but alive.

453
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,000
Go and identify them.

454
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:13,000
The tribunal will see them restored
to you in their original state.

455
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,000
You shall have what you wanted.

456
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,999
You filled four?

457
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
There will be four.

458
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,500
Two mares and two foals.

459
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Is that why you got everything ready?
We're going to the fair?

460
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:34,500
We're waiting for the new ones.
They're coming with us.

461
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,500
You're afraid for me.

462
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I don't know. Those are the orders.

463
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,500
You know your orders.

464
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I'll do as I please.

465
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,999
One of your men did not
surrender his weapons.

466
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,999
Two nobles were killed,
their property stolen

467
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,600
and distributed to the peasants.

468
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:53,499
But I have no more men.

469
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:56,000
That is of no concern.

470
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,200
The princess gave me her word.

471
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:04,000
The princess considers the
terms of the amnesty broken.

472
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Does that make me a prisoner?

473
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,000
Get down.

474
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Lisbeth.

475
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
It's time to go.

476
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,000
Where is the house?

477
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
We're going in exactly
the opposite direction.

478
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,000
Lisbeth!

479
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Eat.

480
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,000
I'm afraid I'll have to live with my aunt.

481
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:04,500
You can't live alone, Lisbeth.

482
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,000
I don't even know her.

483
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I know her.

484
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:33,000
And the house?

485
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
What about the house?

486
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Will I go back there?

487
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:54,000
Lisbeth

488
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
that's not possible.

489
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,500
Apples

490
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
from your home.

491
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
The neighbour agreed.

492
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:39,500
I spoke with him.

493
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,000
He wrote you a letter with the details.

494
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Here, at any moment,
people will begin to pray.

495
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
The bell rings, and they kneel

496
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:29,500
all at the same time.

497
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,500
I had forgotten.

498
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Only we and the Jews remain standing.

499
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:50,000
What's coming...

500
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,000
is hard.

501
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,500
It's hard for me to find...

502
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I don't know.

503
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,000
One word.

504
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:16,000
The princess intervened.

505
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:26,551
I won't be tortured

506
01:44:28,304 --> 01:44:29,596
or flayed

507
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,557
or burned.

508
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:34,851
Thank God.

509
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:38,313
Do you know anything else?

510
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:39,522
Yes.

511
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:42,317
Do you want to tell me?

512
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:48,573
No.

513
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:01,000
The worst is the certainty.

514
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:05,000
I count.

515
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:10,000
Every day, I'm getting closer to Judith.

516
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I'm getting farther away from Lisbeth.

517
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,000
It isn't death.

518
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:21,000
Death, I'm used to.

519
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
I have faith.

520
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:33,000
But knowing absolutely the day,
the hour, and the manner...

521
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:41,000
is the most difficult.

522
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:53,000
Kohlhaas...

523
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:06,000
In the name of Marguerite,
Princess of Angoulême

524
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,500
Queen of Navarre

525
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
sister of the king

526
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:24,000
today, I will give you the
justice that you sought.

527
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
We return to you what was
taken from you by force.

528
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Your horses.

529
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:06,000
The reparation moneys for your manservant.

530
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
César had no family.

531
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:29,000
Give this to someone who needs it.

532
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
The reparation moneys for you.

533
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:32,000
Two years in prison for what he did to you.

534
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
You have what you wanted.

535
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
The horses are for you.

536
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Lisbeth...

537
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:30,000
I know that you're angry.

538
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,000
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

539
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:56,000
I was fortunate to have you.

540
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:00,000
You're very brave.

541
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
You're hurting my fingers.

542
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,000
I want to go.

543
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Now.

544
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Go with her.

545
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,999
Are we waiting for something?

546
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
No.

547
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:21,000
Michael Kohlhaas

548
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:27,000
Now that you rights have
been restored to you

549
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
for having broken the

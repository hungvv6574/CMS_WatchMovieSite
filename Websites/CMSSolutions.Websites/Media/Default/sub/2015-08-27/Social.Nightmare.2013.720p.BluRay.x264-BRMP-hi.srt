Way to go, Cat!

541
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,863
You suck, Cat. I'm
taking my vote back.

542
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,666
Did you think this would make you
popular, you stuck-up bitch?

543
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,468
I had nothing to do with this!

544
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,909
GIRL: Loser!

545
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,678
This is crazy.

546
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,979
Well, it's not me.

547
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,915
Well, these are all
the pictures that we took.

548
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,083
Well, I didn't create the page!

549
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:46,617
It must be the hacker,

550
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,486
the same one that posted
on my BuddyMe page.

551
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,054
Where did they get
all these pictures?

552
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:53,357
They were on the yearbook camera.
I don't know.

553
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,359
Oh, no.

554
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,394
What?

555
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:58,062
They put Joan on here.

556
00:24:58,064 --> 00:24:59,530
(SIGHS)

557
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,566
We should talk
to Mrs. Langran.

558
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,404
Hey.

559
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:08,940
I would never do
something like this.

560
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:10,541
Someone is setting me up.

561
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:13,578
I know you would never
do anything to hurt Joan.

562
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,483
Besides, most of those girls on
that website really are sluts.

563
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,520
That's what I heard.

564
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,522
That's a weird thing to say.

565
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,891
Girls, I need to see
you in my office now.

566
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,559
Ms. Langran,
we have to talk.

567
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:31,429
And you, don't you have a
class you should be in?

568
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:33,498
Thank you. Come on.

569
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,400
Mrs. Langran...

570
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,169
Have a seat, girls.

571
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:42,740
Do you want to tell me
what I am looking at?

572
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,109
Somebody hacked into my
computer and posted this thing.

573
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,577
It's not me, I promise.

574
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,412
Correct me if I'm wrong,

575
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,982
but both of you girls
took these pictures.

576
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,483
Well, yeah,
we did, but...

577
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:54,118
With the school's camera,

578
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,088
and then you hacked into
the admin's email database

579
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,557
and sent this
to every student in school?

580
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,758
No. We took
those pictures,

581
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,426
but we didn't do
the other stuff.

582
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,595
Who took the camera home?

583
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,597
I did.

584
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,600
Did you loan it to anyone?

585
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:10,735
No.

586
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,436
Okay, where's the camera now?

587
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:13,738
In my locker.

588
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,073
I'm gonna need
the camera back immediately.

589
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,074
Of course.

590
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,612
And both of you
are off yearbook.

591
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:22,947
What?

592
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,116
That's B.S.
I didn't even do anything.

593
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:27,018
Okay, Emily... I didn't have
anything to do with it!

594
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,586
I didn't even have
the camera. Cat did.

595
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:31,856
Did Emily have access
to the camera last night?

596
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,027
No. I had it
the whole time.

597
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,762
Okay, then. This is
your responsibility.

598
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,231
I mean, this is very serious.

599
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:42,600
The school could be
held liable for this.

600
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:44,235
I didn't do this.

601
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:45,970
I would never do this.

602
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,172
Mrs. Langran,
please.

603
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:51,175
Well, Emily, you are
off the hook for now.

604
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:55,046
And, Cat, we'll look into this,

605
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,048
but it's not
just gonna go away.

606
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:02,220
All right, now back to
class, both of you.

607
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,663
Wow, Em.
Way to have my back!

608
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,498
What? What do you
want me to say?

609
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,633
Everything she said was true.

610
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,669
Um, how 'bout, "Cat would never do
something like that in a million years.

611
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:19,837
Somebody else
posted the site."

612
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,639
I defended you.
No, you didn't!

613
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,008
You made sure you weren't
kicked off yearbook.

614
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,509
Look, you took those pictures,

615
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:27,578
and you had the camera
the whole time,

616
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,248
so I don't know what happened, but
I'm not getting in trouble for it.

617
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,716
(SCOFFS) Cool!

618
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:34,018
I'm glad we've got
the facts straight.

619
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,026
All right, here we go.

620
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:44,128
Best medicine in the world.

621
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,266
Heh. I don't think ice cream is
gonna fix this problem, Mom.

622
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:51,736
Honey, you remember that's the
same thing you used to say to me

623
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:54,138
when you were in third
grade and Billy Peterson

624
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,707
used to call you
Cat, Cat, the fatty fat.

625
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:57,975
(LAUGHS)

626
00:27:57,977 --> 00:28:00,711
Well, then you fed
the fat girl ice cream.

627
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:03,748
You were never fat.

628
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,549
Plus, it worked, didn't it?

629
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,319
You got over it, and now
Billy Peterson is fat

630
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:11,756
and works at that awful taco stand.
Thank you, ice cream.

631
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:12,890
(LAUGHS)
He does.

632
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,193
(LAUGHS)

633
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,967
Baby, I hate to see you
so stressed out.

634
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,269
I'll get through it.

635
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,040
Good, because next
we're gonna move on

636
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:32,176
to my second prescription
for a tough day, shopping.

637
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:33,611
It's very serious.

638
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:37,048
Oh, that sounds
like serious business.

639
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:44,021
It's actually really impressive how
many times you're on that site.

640
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,624
You know what?
You better be careful.

641
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:49,327
Wrap it up, so you don't
spread your disease.

642
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:51,028
You're on it more than me.

643
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,130
Oh, she burned you, Haylee!

644
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:57,168
What is wrong with you?
You're the one who outed the slut.

645
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,938
I didn't post that site.
Yeah, right.

646
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,007
Heard you got kicked out
of yearbook class.

647
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:07,111
Here. Have a couple.

648
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:09,947
You'll probably need 'em
to keep your GPA up.

649
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,782
That's not all
she's keeping up.

650
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:12,917

651
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,618
Are you all right?

652
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,253
I never even kissed a boy.

653
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,055
I know.

654
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,623
Here you go.

655
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,992
Welcome to the wonderful
world of politics.

656
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,132
What?

657
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:53,057
All right, so I'll put
you down on the list

658
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,159
that you're good with everything
in class and everything?

659
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,660
All right, perfect.

660
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:59,397
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

661
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,432
Hey, Casey, can I talk to you
for a second?

662
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:03,667
I'm kind of busy right now.

663
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,669
Please, Case?
It's kind of important.

664
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,406
It'll just take a second.
I'll talk to you later.

665
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,743
What?
What is this?

666
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,745
Your website pissed off
a lot of people.

667
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:16,680
(SIGHS)
You know me.

668
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,783
I would never do anything
to hurt anybody.

669
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,954
Is there anything you could say
that could change their minds?

670
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,022
This is crazy.

671
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,226
You don't believe me.

672
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:33,030
Cat, I'd like to believe you.
I really would.

673
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,698
Then I wouldn't feel
like such a fool.

674
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,033
What is that supposed to mean?

675
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:39,437
How is it that my name wound up
on your little Internet list?

676
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:41,338
I don't know.
I told you, it's not my website.

677
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,140
Followed by the quote,

678
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:46,710
"Would do anything to make
out with Jason Myerson?"

679
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,479
(SIGHS)
I don't know.

680
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,316
You were the only one
I told that I was gay.

681
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,787
You were the only one,
the only person I trusted.

682
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:58,889
I even knew exactly
when I told you,

683
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,758
two months ago in your bedroom,

684
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,460
helping you with
your calc homework.

685
00:31:02,462 --> 00:31:04,929
It was important for me
to be able to trust somebody,

686
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,730
all right,
to get it off my chest.

687
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,132
Nobody else knew.

688
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:11,735
Casey, you can trust me.
I didn't tell anybody.

689
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:12,903
Really?

690
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:16,740
I was called horrible names
in the hallway this morning.

691
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,275
People laughed at me.

692
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:21,579
Jason is threatening
to beat my ass.

693
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,382
If you didn't make this list,

694
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,318
then you told someone who did.

695
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,422
Maybe somebody guessed just
by the way you look at Jason.

696
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:33,924
Maybe you're not as on the D.L.
as you thought you were.

697
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,793
I don't know
what's more offensive,

698
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:38,195
the idea that you
may have betrayed my trust

699
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,197
or the sentence that just
came out of your mouth.

700
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,198
Either way, we're done.

701
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,100
Oh, Casey, you have...
No.

702
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,535
Hey, please!

703
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:46,036
No! I...

704
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,275
I don't know
what's more offensive,

705
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:53,410
the idea that you
may have betrayed my trust

706
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,412
or the sentence that just
came out of your mouth.

707
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,847
Either way, we're done.

708
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,053
Heard you got kicked
out of yearbook class.

709
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:06,290
I don't know what happened, but I'm
not getting in trouble for it.

710
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,531
All in favor of impeaching
President Cat Hardy,

711
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:16,267
raise your hands
and say, "Yea."

712
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,868
Yea.
Yea.

713
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,805
It's unanimous.

714
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:26,143
All in favor of making Emily Hargrove
Student Body Council President,

715
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,345
raise your hands
and say, "Yea."

716
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,347
Yea!
Yea!

717
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,520
It's unanimous.

718

(GAVEL BANGS)

719
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,074
Cat?

720
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:09,520
What are you doing
home from school?

721
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:11,522
Are you sick?

722
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:14,024
I'm not sick. I just...

723
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:16,493
(CRIES) I just...

724
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,195
I can't be there right now.

725
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:20,397
Everyone hates me!

726
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,534
Oh, Kitty Cat, I don't.

727
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:25,235
This isn't about you!

728
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,539
Mom, I'm sorry. I just...

729
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,309
I got kicked
off Student Council.

730
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,545
What?

731
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:36,180
They can't do that!

732
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,949
Well, apparently they can,
because they already did it,

733
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:41,552
and they announced the runner-up
is gonna take over my office.

734
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:43,287
Emily?

735
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,190
Yeah.

736
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,326
Well, things are going pretty
well for her these days.

737
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:50,961
Look.

738
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,967
Yale?

739
00:33:56,969 --> 00:34:00,270
After you guys spent all
that time petitioning Brown?

740
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,241
I didn't even know
she applied to Yale.

741
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:07,177
Well, you two haven't had
secrets from each other before.

742
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,312
I know.

743
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,347
Oh, baby.

744
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,682
Oh, come he...

745
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:13,917
Oh, my sweetheart.

746
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,085
(CRYING)

747
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:17,221
At least you still
have Brown, okay?

748
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:20,591
What's the point
if Emily's not going?

749
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:23,093
Honey, you know, in life,

750
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:26,497
things rarely go
according to your plans.

751
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:31,268
I'm sorry. It's really all about
being flexible, you know.

752
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,505
So maybe you put off Brown
and you stay here

753
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:37,941
for your first two years
and go to a community college,

754
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:41,078
and then you can live at home.
You're right.

755
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,947
I should go to Brown/RISD
and get my degrees

756
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,217
and start my own business,
because I don't need a partner.

757
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,020
Uh, honey, you're not
really hearing me.

758
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:51,455
No, you're right.

759
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,594
Be flexible.
Yes, be flexible.

760
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,363
Cat, where are you going?
To Emily's.

761
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:03,233
I'm gonna tell her I'm gonna start my
own business and I don't need her.

762
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:06,603
Just... Honey,
don't burn any bridges.

763
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,605
I'm not.
I'm crossing them.

764
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,041
Cat!

765
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,227
Hi.

766
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,064
Emily, it's Cat!

767
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,706
Just a second, Cat.

768
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,175
Tell her to go away.
She's standing there.

769
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,211
I don't care!
I don't want to talk to her!

770
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:48,512
Just go. Just go.

771
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,553
Hi.

772
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:57,755
So I guess congratulations

773
00:35:57,757 --> 00:35:59,623
are in order
for Student Council.

774
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,025
You can't blame me for that.

775
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:04,161
Who can I blame for
lying to me about Yale?

776
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:06,363
I didn't lie!
I just didn't tell you

777
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,298
every single little detail
of my life.

778
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,070
We had a plan, Em.

779
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:14,404
We were a team.

780
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,379
You think I made that website,
don't you, and that BuddyMe post?

781
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,248
You don't think
there's a hacker at all.

782
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,216
You know what?

783
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,518
I'm kind of over this,

784
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
so you just go to Brown,
I'll go to Yale,

785
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,688
and maybe I'll see you
at the reunion in 10 years.

786
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,392
Or not.

787
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:36,693
I have to go.

788
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:45,135
(CRYING)

789
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,405
It's like, I'm gonna
drive straight,

790
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,073
and then I'm gonna turn left.

791
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,375
(LAUGHING)

792
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:54,478
Hey, I can help you
keep score if you want.

793
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,146
Oh, what's the matter, Cat?

794
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:57,147
Got your tongue?

795
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:59,650
(LAUGHING)
Oh!

796
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,725
Hey, Cat.

797
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,427
You okay?

798
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,095
Oh.

799
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,096
Hi.

800
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,231
Roger.

801
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,836
What's going on?
You look upset.

802
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,142
You got troubles, huh?

803
00:37:25,144 --> 00:37:26,643
Yeah.

804
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,612
It's 'cause of that
scoreboard website?

805
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:31,181
Look, I know it has
my name on it,

806
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:33,183
but I didn't put up that site.

807
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:35,786
Somebody went through a lot of
trouble to screw up my life.

808
00:37:35,788 --> 00:37:38,522
And it's not just the website.
It's the BuddyMe page.

809
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,858
Someone posted things
that I didn't post.

810
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,194
Worst part of it all is
nobody seems to believe me.

811
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,331
I believe you.

812
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:51,201
Look, nothing is safe
on the Internet.

813
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:53,770
No matter how secure
you think you are,

814
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,641
there are people out there
that can hack into anything.

815
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,776
Look, I know this guy.

816
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,279
He might be able to help you.

817
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,715
He's a full-on
computer genius.

818
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:07,351
He... I had a problem. He helped
me out a few months ago.

819
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:09,353
What kind of problem?

820
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:12,289
Well, someone was
catfishing this girl

821
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,191
using a picture of me
from track.

822
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:16,727
So do you think
he would help me?

823
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:18,862
Well, of course he would, yeah.

824
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:20,864
I mean,
he's a good friend of mine.

825
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,933
That would be so great.

826
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:25,736
Why don't you meet me
over at his place

827
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:28,739
after school,
say, 5:00?

828
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:30,507
Sure.

829
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:31,642
Okay.

830
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,577
Here. I'll give you
his address.

831
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:36,580
Thank you so much
for your help.

832
00:38:36,582 --> 00:38:38,181
I so appreciate it.

833
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:39,583
Yeah, it's okay.

834
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:42,519
I gotta run, but I'll...
I'll see you later?

835
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,520
Yeah.
Okay.

836
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:44,821
Bye.
Bye.

837
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,647
Cat! You made it.

838
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,649
Hey.
Come on in.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

840
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,489
Cat, this is
my good buddy, Cool D.

841
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,559
Wassup?
Cool,

842
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:25,662
this is the girl I was
talking to you about, Cat?

843
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:26,830
Hi.

844
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,500
Go ahead.
Sit down.

845
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,738
He not only fixed
my catfishing problem.

846
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,907
We actually found the
guy who was doing it.

847
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:38,575
Really?

848
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:39,876
Hell, yeah.

849
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,611
Just gotta know
what you're looking for.

850
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,751
Cold one?

851
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,319
So you think you can help?

852
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:52,489
Well, that is always
a possibility, right?

853
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,761
Hey, yo, why don't you
give us some privacy

854
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,463
so I can converse
freely with my client?

855
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,668
Okay, sure.

856
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:17,481
So? Holler at me.

857
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:21,318
Somebody posted a website using
information from my computer.

858
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,286
Yeah.

859
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,521
You mean this one?

860
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,526
Yeah.

861
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,631
Do you think you can find out
who hacked into my stuff?

862
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,466
If you remember
when it happened.

863
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:38,902
I can look into the logs
on your router,

864
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:42,439
see if there's any traffic going
into your computer, you know.

865
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,974
Someone maybe copied your data.

866
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:47,010
That is, if they hacked in using
one of them Trojans online.

867
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:49,813
(LAUGHS)

868
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:52,916
Has anybody had access to your
computer without you knowing?

869
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:55,485
No. I'm the only one.

870
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:57,954
All right.
Did you bring it with you?

871
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,556
Yeah, it's right here.

872
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,959
That's what's up.

873
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,632
So, when can you start?

874
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:11,101
Well, there's still
the matter of my fee.

875
00:41:11,103 --> 00:41:14,771
Right.
How much do you charge?

876
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:16,673
Something like this

877
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,675
is gonna run you
the tune of, like,

878
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:19,812
10 Gs.

879
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:23,814
Wow, that's a lot of money.

880
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:26,616
I do quality work.

881
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:29,352
Uh, I'll see...

882
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,687
(LAUGHS)

883
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,689
I'm just messing
with you, girl.

884
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:35,358
Damn.
What?

885
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,927
I don't expect you to come up

886
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:38,695
with that type of money.
You crazy?

887
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:41,798
Oh, okay.

888
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,433
Yeah, for sure,

889
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:45,435
'cause it's not always
about the monies.

890

I don't,

892
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,642
but I can figure out some
way to pay you later.

Okay.

Cat, you are typically
a really good student,

908
00:42:56,441 --> 00:43:00,010
but I have to say I'm very concerned
with what is going on here.

909
00:43:00,012 --> 00:43:02,879
I've had four girls
come to talk to me

910
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:05,015
about this scoreboard site
just this morning.

911
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:09,786
They say boys are writing
stories about them,

912
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:12,122
lying in the comments section.

913
00:43:12,124 --> 00:43:13,857
They were very upset.

914
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,593
I'm upset, too.

915
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,728
I didn't post it.
I think it's gross.

916
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:22,132
It doesn't seem like
something you would do.

917
00:43:22,134 --> 00:43:24,301
It's not me, I swear.

918
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,737
I didn't post it.

919
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:30,907
Somebody hacked
into my accounts.

920
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,944
Well, can you think of
who would want to do that?

921
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:36,880
I don't know.
Somebody jealous,

922
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:39,249

to ruin my life.

923
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:41,952

924
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:46,056
I don't know.

00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:47,891

who's behind this,

to the bottom of this.

01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:19,081
Because I earned being class president.
I earned Brown!

1244
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,483
I didn't have to beg
for those things like you.

1245
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:22,618
Face it, Emily.

1246
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:25,487
You're good, but I'm better,
and you can't deal with it.

1247
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:28,057
I want to smash your face in.

1248
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:29,558
Oh, so do it.

1249
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:37,566
What in the world?

1250
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:39,201
Hey!

1251
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:40,669
Don't!

1252
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:42,905
Cat! Emily!

1253
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:44,006
Stop this right now!

1254
01:00:44,008 --> 01:00:45,107
Cat!
Emily! Emily!

1255
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:46,108
Stop this right now!

1256
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,509
Watch me!
Emily, stop.

1257
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:48,911
Right now.

1258
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,948
Don't touch my daughter!
Back off!

1259
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,717
Keep your hands off her!
That's assault!

1260
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:56,518
She assaulted
my daughter first!

1261
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,686
Hey, Cat started it.

1262
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:59,822
You be quiet!
Whoa! Whoa!

1263
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:01,991
Put that phone away,
or I'll take it from you!

1264
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:03,859
DANIEL: Get back!
Stay away from me!

1265
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:04,960
I'm calling the police.

1266
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:06,161
Good.

1267
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,529
EMILY: No.

1268
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:09,865
No, it was me. I...

1269
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:11,233
I started it.

1270
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:17,006
What are you gonna do about it?

1271
01:01:17,008 --> 01:01:18,607
I'm already suspended,

1272
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:21,210
so you guys don't have
to deal with me anymore.

1273
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,549
That's the second fight Cat's had
on school property this week.

1274
01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:28,884
So why isn't she suspended?

1275
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:30,619
Mr. Hargroves, I'll handle this.

1276
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:32,154
'Cause you're doing a real
bang-up job up till now!

1277
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:33,322
Give me that phone.

1278
01:01:33,324 --> 01:01:35,024
Hey, no way. No way!
This is for Emily

1279
01:01:35,026 --> 01:01:37,760
if she decides to
change her mind.

1280
01:01:37,762 --> 01:01:39,328
Take that phone from him.

1281
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,996
You gonna let him
post that online

1282
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:44,033
just like he did all those
dirty pictures of...

1283
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:45,334
Daniel, go home.

1284
01:01:45,336 --> 01:01:48,003
Take his phone!
Mrs. Hardy, please!

1285
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:49,705
My daughter is being bullied,

1286
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:52,341
and I don't see the school
doing a thing about it.

1287
01:01:52,343 --> 01:01:54,310
Okay, we'll schedule a
meeting as soon as possible.

1288
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,714
You're damn right we will.
Come on, baby.

1289
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:16,932
Can't find my phone.
It's not in your bag?

1290
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:19,168
No. I think I dropped it
during the fight.

1291
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:22,304
We'll call the office and
see if anyone turned it in.

1292
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:24,106
I think someone picked it up.

1293
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:27,209
That's all I need, more
people looking at my stuff.

1294
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:33,282
Honey, where did those...

1295
01:02:33,284 --> 01:02:35,951
underwear pictures come from?

1296
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,924
I took them.

1297
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:43,926
Why?

1298
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:46,295
I thought Danny was special.

1299
01:02:46,297 --> 01:02:47,896
I thought he'd keep them
to himself.

1300
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:49,231
(SIGHS)

1301
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:51,767
What you kids just
don't understand

1302
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:54,970
is that these things
that you put up online

1303
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:58,974
and these pictures that you
post or send or whatever you do

1304
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:01,343
is they... they
stick around forever.

1305
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:04,947
They have a life. They...
Even if you erase them,

1306
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:07,983
people, creepy people, can pass
them on and on, and they...

1307
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:10,185
Okay, I don't need
a lecture right now!

1308
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:14,723
I learned my lesson. I'll
never trust anyone again!

1309
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:16,358
Oh.

1310
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:24,333
Mom.
Yeah?

1311
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:29,104
I didn't know you
had a miscarriage.

1312
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:31,373
That was a long time ago, baby.

1313
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,377
Do you want to talk about it?

1314
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,084
Maybe I won't go to Brown.

1315
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:48,023
Maybe I'll just stay at home like
you said, go to community college.

1316
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,428
It's up to you, sweetheart.

1317
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,468
Just for a while.

1318
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:07,042
She can't sleep.

1319
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:08,477
She's been on antidepressants.

1320
01:04:08,479 --> 01:04:11,213
I mean, this has
just gone on too far.

1321
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:13,449
Daniel has admitted
to sending those photos,

1322
01:04:13,451 --> 01:04:14,983
and we have
suspended him accordingly.

1323
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:16,718
Well, that's not good enough!

1324
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,720
Well, we have no proof
that he's done anything else.

1325
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:22,991
My daughter is 17 years old!
She is a minor!

1326
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:26,495
What he's done is basically
distributed child pornography.

1327
01:04:26,497 --> 01:04:30,065
I want him expelled permanently,

1328
01:04:30,067 --> 01:04:32,267
and I'm gonna call
the authorities.

1329
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:33,735
No, Mom, don't.

1330
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:35,737
I just want to forget
this ever happened.

1331
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,407
Honey, we cannot let him
victimize you like that.

1332
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:39,908
That fight,

1333
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:42,144
he's probably posting
that online right now.

1334
01:04:42,146 --> 01:04:43,946
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

1335
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:49,384
Yes, go ahead, and send both
of them in, please. Thank you.

1336
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,056
We have another problem.

1337
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:55,591
What now?

1338
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:02,431
Mr. Perryman, Ms. Langran,
you know Cat's mother...

1339
01:05:02,433 --> 01:05:04,199
Hello, Cat.
Mrs. Hardy.

1340
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:06,335
Hey.
Mr. Perryman, go ahead.

1341
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:10,405
Mrs. Langran has a program that we run
all of the students' papers through.

1342
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:14,176
It checks the written story
to Internet archives.

1343
01:05:14,178 --> 01:05:17,446
It's the first thing I do when a
student turns in an assignment.

1344
01:05:17,448 --> 01:05:19,515
I hate to accuse you, Cat.

1345
01:05:19,517 --> 01:05:21,450
You're an excellent student.

1346
01:05:21,452 --> 01:05:23,118
Your AP final,

1347
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,255
the program found
a match for plagiarism.

1348
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:28,557
What?
This isn't my paper.

1349
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,095
That's what you turned in.
I didn't write this.

1350
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:36,131
That is the paper
you handed to me yesterday.

1351
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:46,208
I give up.

1352
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,411
This is serious, young lady.

1353
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:51,513
We take charges of plagiarism
very seriously.

1354
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,949
This, you take seriously?

1355
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:58,186
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to fail you, Cat,

1356
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:01,223
and you won't be able to
continue in the AP classes.

1357
01:06:01,225 --> 01:06:03,091
But the school year's
almost over.

1358
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:05,060
Those classes will be
removed from your record,

1359
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:09,331
and you probably will not
graduate this spring.

1360
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:10,899
This is insanity.

1361
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:12,334
She's going to Brown!

1362
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:15,103
Cat, this is
so out of character for you.

1363
01:06:15,105 --> 01:06:16,905
You don't seem okay.

1364
01:06:16,907 --> 01:06:18,473
She's not okay.
She is being punished

1365
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,242
for absolutely no reason.
Come on, Cat.

1366
01:06:20,244 --> 01:06:22,511
Is anything going on
that I should know about?

1367
01:06:22,513 --> 01:06:24,980
Maybe you should look
into how those essays

1368
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:27,316
ended up on your computer
program, Ms. Langran.

1369
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:28,550
What are you insinuating?

1370
01:06:30,253 --> 01:06:31,553
I don't know
what your problem is,

1371
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:33,388
but you've been doing
everything you can

1372
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,223
to make sure
that my daughter fails.

1373
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:38,126
Well, I am sorry
you feel that way.

1374
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,262
We are suing you. We are
suing this district.

1375
01:06:40,264 --> 01:06:42,331
We are suing those bullies!

1376
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,100
Mrs. Hardy, considering
everything that's happened,

1377
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:47,369
you might decide
that homeschooling

1378
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:49,371
is more appropriate
for your daughter.

1379
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:52,941
(SCOFFS) It'd be a hell of a
lot better than this zoo.

1380
01:06:52,943 --> 01:06:56,078
And you can wipe that phony
look of concern off your face!

1381
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:05,087
It's okay, sweetie. I'm gonna
fight this thing all the way.

1382
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:09,224
Don't you get it?
I don't want to fight anymore.

1383
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:12,160
They actually suggested
you homeschool.

1384
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:13,695
Sounds good to me.

1385
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,011
You know what?
I am so sick of this!

1386
01:07:29,013 --> 01:07:30,512
I earned being president!

1387
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:32,547
I didn't have to beg
for those things like you did.

1388
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,050
You're good, but I'm better,
and you can't deal with it.

1389
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,718
I want to smash your face in.

1390
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,420
So do it.

1391
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:39,388
Oh!

1392
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:43,125
Oh, you okay, baby?

1393
01:07:43,127 --> 01:07:45,427
You have a nightmare?

1394
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:47,696
Bad dream?

1395
01:07:47,698 --> 01:07:50,599
Oh, I just keep thinking
about that fight with Emily

1396
01:07:50,601 --> 01:07:52,601
and how Daniel
has it on his phone

1397
01:07:52,603 --> 01:07:54,302
and how I can't find my phone

1398
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,338
and how I'm just gonna
go online any minute

1399
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:59,408
and see this title like "Real Cat
Fight," and I'm just so sick of it.

1400
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:01,576
Calm down, baby.
Calm down.

1401
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,311
Here. Take one of these.

1402
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:04,646
It's not time yet.

1403
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:06,615
It'll relax you.

1404
01:08:06,617 --> 01:08:08,016
(SIGHS)
Come on.

1405
01:08:08,018 --> 01:08:09,551
It'll make you feel better.

1406
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,261
I have to talk to Daniel.

1407
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:22,064
What? No.

1408
01:08:22,066 --> 01:08:23,465
No good can come from that.

1409
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:25,434
Just stay away
from those people.

1410
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:32,274
Come on. Let's get you
back to sleep.

1411
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,680
Why did you send everyone
those pictures of Cat?

1412
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,788
What do you care?

1413
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,057
I thought you hated her guts.

1414
01:08:49,059 --> 01:08:51,226
I do.

1415
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:53,061
We've been friends
a really long time, okay?

1416
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:55,697
It's hard to just stop
caring about her.

1417
01:08:58,401 --> 01:09:01,403
Do you still have
that video of us fighting?

1418
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:03,071
Maybe.

1419
01:09:03,073 --> 01:09:04,339
Well, can you erase it?

1420
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:05,707
Because the last thing I need

1421
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:07,776
is for more embarrassing
crap to get out there.

1422
01:09:07,778 --> 01:09:10,779
Maybe I'll erase it.
Maybe I won't.

1423
01:09:10,781 --> 01:09:12,214
I don't know yet.

1424
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,085
What?

1425
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:18,787
Are you the one
doing all this stuff?

1426
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:22,357
W-Wait. Are you serious?

1427
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:26,728
You know what?
I-I've figured you out.

1428
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:28,797
You're totally
obsessed with Cat.

1429
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,265
That's what it is.

1430
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:32,134
That's what it's got to be.

1431
01:09:32,136 --> 01:09:33,235
What?
Yeah.

1432
01:09:33,237 --> 01:09:37,139
Taking all the same classes.
Making the same plans.

1433
01:09:37,141 --> 01:09:39,441
You guys even go to
the restroom together.

1434
01:09:39,443 --> 01:09:40,776
Yeah. We're girls.

1435
01:09:40,778 --> 01:09:42,511
That's, like, what we do!

1436
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:44,746
I'm not the one
who took her vulnerable,

1437
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:46,448
trusting first attempts
at sexuality

1438
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,817
and just tossed them all out
there for the world to see!

You and I, yeah, we're done.

1442
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:57,325
You know what? I think we're
all pretty much done.

1443
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:58,326

01:09:58,328 --> 01:10:00,529

They just...

1451

They said they were
moved by my appeal,

1452
01:10:45,175 --> 01:10:46,641
and they're... they're
letting me in!

I wish you wouldn't
sneak up on me like that.

1458
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:17,272
How long was I asleep?

1459
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:18,540
A while.

1460
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:19,975
You probably needed it.

1461

Your body needs to recover
from all that stress.

Ehh. I don't like
this medication.

1463
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,916
It makes me sleepy.

1464
01:11:27,918 --> 01:11:30,385
Well, the doctor said

1465
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:33,889
that you'd need time
to adjust to it, so...

1466
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:40,862
Is the sun coming up
or going down?

1467

It's evening, honey.
It's almost time for dinner.

1468
01:11:43,934 --> 01:11:45,967
Are you hungry?

1469
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,369
No.

1470
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:53,642
Oh, Kitty Cat, why don't
you look at that after?

1471
01:11:53,644 --> 01:11:55,277
It's from Brown.

1472

woken up or eaten something.

to community college

Okay.

1492
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,866
I'll run to the store
and get some.

1493
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:55,003
No, you don't have to do that.

1494

Anything else
you want me to get?

1496
01:13:01,345 --> 01:13:04,479
Did you call the school
about my cellphone?

1497
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:06,348
Nobody's turned it in.

1498
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:08,316
Oh. I want
to go look for it.

1499
01:13:08,318 --> 01:13:10,385
We did that already, honey.
I talked to the office,

1500
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:11,820
and they said
nobody's turned it in.

1501
01:13:11,822 --> 01:13:13,521
Well, I want to go look again,

1502
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:14,856
because somebody
took it, so...

1503
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:16,358
Don't get so upset.

1504
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,493

1588
01:21:38,962 --> 01:21:41,229
Oh, stop trying
to manipulate me.

1589
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:44,365
Without you,
I don't want to live.

1590
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:47,368
(CRYING)
I don't want to live.

1591
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:51,839
I was an only child
just like you,

1592
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:55,243
and I... I know what
it's like, and it's lonely,

1593
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:59,447
and I tried to give you
a baby brother or a sister,

1594
01:21:59,449 --> 01:22:01,916
but I kept losing them,

1595
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:05,953
my poor, beautiful babies.

1596
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:13,194
Then the doctor said that it was
too dangerous to try anymore,

1597
01:22:13,196 --> 01:22:15,196
and that's when
your father left.

1598
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:16,430
Oh, Mom...

1599
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:19,267
But I'm so proud of you.

1600
01:22:19,269 --> 01:22:22,203
I'm so proud and so happy

1601
01:22:22,205 --> 01:22:25,506
that you have so many friends
and you're so popular

1602
01:22:25,508 --> 01:22:29,577
and you're into projects and on
teams and you run for office,

1603
01:22:29,579 --> 01:22:32,914
and you're just...
You're so amazing,

1604
01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:34,949
and that's why I wanted...

1605
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:38,052
I wanted you to feel like
you were part of something.

1606
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:40,288
Then why did you ruin it?

1607
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:45,626
Because I just
can't lose another baby.

1608
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:48,529
EMILY: Cat!

1609
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:52,900
You've hurt people, Mom,
people who I care about!

1610
01:22:52,902 --> 01:22:54,502
They don't care about you!

1611
01:22:54,504 --> 01:22:56,203
Cat!
Mom, this is my life!

1612
01:22:56,205 --> 01:22:58,205
Stay out of it!

1613
01:22:58,207 --> 01:23:01,242
Emily doesn't even care
about your four-year plan!

1614
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:04,245
Stay out of my life!

1615
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:05,246

01:23:05,248 --> 01:23:08,149

MRS. HARDY:
Leave us alone!

1619
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:15,923
Stop it! No!
Just leave us alone.

1620
01:23:15,925 --> 01:23:17,458
Get off!

1621
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,593
Stop it!
Can't take my daughter!

1622
01:23:18,595 --> 01:23:20,528
You can't have my daughter!

1623
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:21,662
Stop!

OPERATOR: 911.
What's your emergency?

1625
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,468
It's my mother!

1626
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:29,370
She's attacking my best friend!

1627
01:23:29,372 --> 01:23:31,405
Please hurry!

1628
01:23:31,407 --> 01:23:32,540
Let go!

1629
01:23:32,542 --> 01:23:34,108
Let go!

1630
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,176

Let go! Get off!

1633
01:23:39,415 --> 01:23:41,482
Look at yourself!

1634
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:43,684
Look at what you're doing!

1635
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:46,087
Look at what you're doing!

01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,660
Em! Em!

1638
01:23:52,662 --> 01:23:53,728
Breathe.

1639
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:55,262
Breathe.

1640
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,331
Breathe. You okay?

No!
Hey, Hey!

01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:06,374
That's enough.
That's enough.

1644

Ma'am, that's enough.

1645
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,510
Calm down.

1646
01:24:09,512 --> 01:24:11,045
Calm down.

Oh, Cat!

Cat!

1649
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:14,615
That's enough.

1651
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:17,318

(POLICE DISPATCH CHATTER)

1655
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:39,173
Mom.

1656
01:24:39,175 --> 01:24:43,077
My baby. My baby.

1657
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:19,613
Better get off that thing.
We don't want to be late for class,

1658
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:22,349
especially after the way Professor
Claude chewed us out last time.

1659
01:25:22,351 --> 01:25:24,251
Okay, I'm almost done.

1660
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:28,189
Hmm, Daniel sent you
another one.

1661
01:25:28,191 --> 01:25:30,458
So romantic how he
sends you real mail.

1662
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,494
Jeez, aren't you
ever gonna forgive him?

1663
01:25:33,496 --> 01:25:35,229
I know what he did
was messed up,

1664
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:37,098
but he had...
did have a lot going on

1665
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,132
with that whole
birth-mom situation.

1666
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:39,567
I do forgive him.

1667
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:41,469
But?

1668
01:25:42,671 --> 01:25:44,672
I can't forget.

1669
01:25:44,674 --> 01:25:47,508
Well, plainly that
was a bonehead move.

1670
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,677
However, you did look very
hot in those pictures.

1671
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,579
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
At least I'll have something

1672
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:52,847
to show my future grandchildren.

I'm out.

She feels really bad.

1677
01:26:02,592 --> 01:26:04,825
She asks about you
all the time.

Cool, but I can't forget
either, so see you in class.

Hi, Mom.

Hi, baby. How are you?
Good. Really busy.

How are you doing?

Don't think I ever will.

I've been doing some painting.

1687
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:36,690
Are they still trying
to adjust your medication?

1688
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:40,194
Yeah.
I feel like a lab rat.

1689
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:44,198
This last combination,
I've been on for, like, a week now.

1690
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,801
They say it could still take some time
to get it right.

1691
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:50,471
It seems like it's working.

1692

Haven't tried to kill
anyone lately.

for a chemical imbalance.

Yeah.

01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:01,315
I know. That's what
my therapist says.

Um, you're making progress.
I can tell.

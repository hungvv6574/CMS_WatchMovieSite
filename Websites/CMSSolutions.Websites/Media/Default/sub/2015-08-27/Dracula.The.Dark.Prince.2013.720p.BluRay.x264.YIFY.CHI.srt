359
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:36,134
Alina. My name is Alina.

360
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:38,070
Ah.

361
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:41,540
A Greek name, I do believe.

362
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:44,276
If I'm not mistaken,
it means light.

363
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:46,578
It also means fire.

364
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,814
You are hurt.

365
00:29:48,816 --> 00:29:51,483
Go ahead, kill me.

366
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,351
Oh, on the contrary.

367
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:55,454
No one shall touch you.

368
00:29:55,456 --> 00:29:57,289
Renfield,

369
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,224
show our guest to
the west wing.

370
00:29:59,226 --> 00:30:01,760
- <i>See to her injury.
- The west wing, my lord?</i>

371
00:30:01,762 --> 00:30:05,097
The royal suite...

372
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:07,265
for Alina of the light.

373
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:09,434
As you wish, my lord.

374
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,771
My lord.

375

<i>(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)</i>

376
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:50,742
Do not give up hope.

377
00:30:50,744 --> 00:30:52,844
I feel that Alina

378
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:55,447
may still be alive.

379
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:58,884
Look on the ground behind you.

380
00:31:00,686 --> 00:31:02,687
I believe

381
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:04,689
that this sign is telling us

382
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:06,725
that your sister
is not only alive,

383
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:09,161
but somehow thriving.

384
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:12,164
We'll save her.

385
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,666
LEONARDO: <i>Yes.</i>

386
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:16,668
We will leave now.

387
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,937
Even though the scourge
of Dracula's army

388
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:20,772
cannot rise in the day,

389
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:23,275
we will travel
throughout the night

390
00:31:23,277 --> 00:31:25,377

391
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:48,266
- You're not coming?
- No.

392
00:31:48,268 --> 00:31:51,303
- This is where we say goodbye.
- <i>Even after all you've seen?</i>

393
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:53,572
The scourge, the Lightbringer,
you want to leave?

394
00:31:53,574 --> 00:31:56,541
I don't even know what the Lightbringer
is or why it responded to me.

395
00:31:56,543 --> 00:31:59,411
The question is not
why it chose you,

396
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:00,946
but who you really are.

397
00:32:00,948 --> 00:32:02,948
Not interested.

398
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,517
Have you not seen the giant
pile of bodies here?

399
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,952
Next time will be different.

400
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:09,254
There won't be a "next time."

401
00:32:09,256 --> 00:32:11,456
Well, what about your friends?
Don't you want to avenge them?

402
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,991
And what good would that do?

403
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:14,893
They're dead and they're
not coming back.

404
00:32:14,895 --> 00:32:17,729
Or have you got a little magic
walking stick for that, too?

405
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:18,964
What about Alina?

406
00:32:23,502 --> 00:32:26,404
What about her?

407
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:30,308
Come, Esme. Let us go.

408
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,311
You can't force someone
to do the right thing.

409
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:36,581
And you don't want to be alone

410
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,851
when the undead return.

411
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,929

the Lady Alina is resting.

415
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:28,733
What do you think, Renfield?

416
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:30,969
There is a remarkable
resemblance.

417
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:34,572
But is it more?

418
00:33:34,574 --> 00:33:37,909
My lord, be wary
of coincidence.

419
00:33:37,911 --> 00:33:40,412
The girl may bear her
face, but never her soul.

420
00:33:40,414 --> 00:33:42,547
Is it possible

421
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:44,015
<i>for us to return

422
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:47,319
Born again in another time?

423
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:50,522
Be careful

424
00:33:50,524 --> 00:33:55,493
where the parts of your
mind wander, my lord.

425
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:58,730
I fear they will only
lead to disappointment.

426
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:00,899
I would welcome disappointment.

427
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:03,468
The elders said we should
not dwell on the past.

428
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,036
The elders are gone,

429
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:07,439
along with their
outdated beliefs.

430
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:09,741
Should not some of their
beliefs be reconsidered?

431
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:11,910
No.

432
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:14,379
We have our own ways now.

433
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:21,453
I see you are still young
at heart, my master.

434
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:37,569
I'm not unsettled. I
need her, Renfield.

435
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:40,004
Are not the women of
the castle enough to

436
00:34:40,006 --> 00:34:42,507
sate your appetite?

437
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:45,076
A thousand of them could never
fill the void she left behind.

438
00:34:47,113 --> 00:34:49,114
You should rest.

439
00:34:49,116 --> 00:34:50,951
How could I possibly
think about sleep now?

Without it, it would grow weak.

See to it that the

You know my heart cannot
leave this place.

Renfield...

447
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:20,912
watch over her for me.

448
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:23,148
Of course, sire.

Only stories mothers told their little

And what story did
your mother tell you?

Once there was a
great, handsome prince

who fought gallantly
for Transylvania.

468
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:26,931
he turned to the dark side.

469
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:29,167
He lost his faith.

470
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:32,236
He put his own selfish
desires ahead of God's.

471
00:38:32,238 --> 00:38:34,806
<i>He was let down by his knights</i>

00:38:44,784 --> 00:38:48,353
He was a great knight.

why my master prefers
the shadows.

you were from the

see you again.

Stand for the master.

You've waited for this

And here you are. Welcome.

909
01:17:28,139 --> 01:17:30,406
I have come with
no other intent

910
01:17:30,408 --> 01:17:34,343
but to end your
poisonous ways forever.

911
01:17:34,345 --> 01:17:36,278
I believe you.

912
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:40,516
And yet I'm impressed with you.

913
01:17:40,518 --> 01:17:42,451
Your courage.

914
01:17:42,453 --> 01:17:45,321
Your fortitude.

915
01:17:45,323 --> 01:17:47,189
Your persistence.

916
01:17:47,191 --> 01:17:49,625
Your knowledge

917
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:51,694
about me.

918
01:17:51,696 --> 01:17:55,164
And in many ways, perhaps you know
me better than I know myself.

you one of mine...

and I could have.

921
01:18:08,378 --> 01:18:10,446
Have you turned the girl?

922
01:18:10,448 --> 01:18:12,114
No.

923
01:18:14,584 --> 01:18:16,518
Not yet.

924
01:18:18,355 --> 01:18:21,690
What can I offer you
to set her free?

925
01:18:23,727 --> 01:18:25,561
I'm afraid I can't do that.

926

Lord Dracula,

927
01:18:28,332 --> 01:18:30,265
have you ever considered

928
01:18:30,267 --> 01:18:32,568
that this God you
turned against

929
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:34,136
truly does exist

930
01:18:34,138 --> 01:18:35,537
and if you take this girl,

931
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:38,173
you will never be able
to forgive yourself?

932
01:18:42,212 --> 01:18:43,746
You're suggesting that my soul

933
01:18:43,748 --> 01:18:46,682
is not completely lost.

934
01:18:46,684 --> 01:18:49,351
No one, in my thought,

935
01:18:49,353 --> 01:18:51,086
is completely lost.

936
01:18:51,088 --> 01:18:53,122

we'll speak again.

940

We will let him live.

941

For now.

942
01:19:14,078 --> 01:19:16,178
I must rest.

943
01:19:22,485 --> 01:19:24,820
Could it be any
darker down here?

944

He is coming.

1
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:29,428
Reid, Ben, and Darrin
and I, we've been
friends for a while now.

2
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,032
They were just normal guys,
you know, like, everyday,

3
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,466
the kind of guys, you know,
you would just

4
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,068
go watch a football game with

5
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,237
or, you know, have a beer.

6
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,472
They're not crazy people.
They're just regular guys.

7
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,709
Um, and it's not like
them to just take off.

8
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,044
<i>Reid was
the best brother</i>

9
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,311
<i>anyone could have.</i>

10
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,780
<i>He always took care of me.</i>

11
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:50,282
This is the old Reid
over here.

12
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,618
He was really great
at sports and really
liked to play the guitar.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,188
And then this is
the new crazy Reid.

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,091
All this crazy reading
material about UFOs,

15
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,060
weird DVDs and maps.

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,464
Reid stopped
returning my phone calls.

17
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,133
And then I got really scared
when he got fired.

18
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,635
As I said, he was
a great, great, uh,

19
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,236
asset to the company.

20
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,173
But about three months
before he disappeared,

21
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:17,509
he had a real change
in attitude.

22
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,479
He came to work late.
He spent a lot of
time on the Internet.

23
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,682
Stuff that we found
in his desk after he left,

24
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,484
a bunch of color pictures
of UFOs.

25
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,388
My brother wouldn't
just disappear.

26
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,789
Three people aren't just
gonna disappear.

27
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,158
Something is going on.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,726
And the fact that nobody
knows anything,

29
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,328
nobody will talk to us...

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,464
Everybody's avoiding us.
For what?

31
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,766
Somebody knows something,
and they're not telling us.

32
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,334
I would think that a person

33
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:46,338
who tried to sneak into
Area 51 and get video,

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,373
even a person who succeeded
in getting that video,

35
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,615
would be in serious trouble.

36
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,670
The camera's the girl?
The camera
is the girl.

37
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,554
Like, practice with it.
Like, what do you say
to these girls?

38
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,824
Hello. My name is Reid.

39
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,693
What's yours?

40
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,495
And then we'd start
a conversation

41
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:10,629
about, you know,
what the other one does...

42
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,131
Fascinating.

43
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,165
This is like a brand new...

44
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,600
It's like a...

45
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,168
I might try this tonight,
I don't know.

46
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,735
This is a new thing.
It's revolutionary.

47
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,771
We just need Ben
not to screw it up.

48
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,273
Oh, I will not screw it up.

49
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,558
You are a massive
cock block.

50
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,842
- I am not a massive cock block.
- Yes, you are.

51
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,477
I am a good friend

52
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,580
that just tries to
encourage his roommate...

53
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,250
For the record,
I will never block
another man's cock, all right?

54
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:33,685
Says the man in
the sherbet cardigan.

55
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,288
Okay, first of all,
this is not sherbet.

56
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,458
This is a salmon-colored
cardigan.

57
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,726
You looked up
the def...

58
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,545
- Yeah.
- Great, let's hear it.

59
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:44,363
It's a picture of
your face, man.

60
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,465
Reid, I don't see
any houses up here.

61
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,735
Oh, here we go. Okay.

62
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,236
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

63
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
Rub my stomach?
What happened to,
"Hello, Reid"?

64
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,510
- First, bar. Then beer pong.
- Done.

65
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,379
Shots, shots, and shots
and then beer pong.

66
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,021
See you tomorrow.

67
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,916
Take one.
Oh, Jesus.

68
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:04,883
Thank you. Thank you.
Take one. Pass it down.

69
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:05,817
Take one. Pass it down.

70
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,253
Cheers.

71
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,288
All right, cool,
just don't drop it.

72
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,689
All right. My babies.

73
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,758
If we win, you have to jump
in the pool naked.

74
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,194
You know I like being naked.
I'm not worried about that.

75
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,762
I was talking to Danielle,
but if you...

76
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,797
I'll make that
bet for both of us.

77
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,200
You have to sing karaoke.
You have to rap.

78
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,635
Oh!

79
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,237
Danielle and I are
the ultimate partners.

80
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,572
We're gonna be here all night.

81
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,841
Son of a bitch!
Damn it.

82
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,476
Chug-a-lug, Reid.
You know what this means?

83
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,645
You know what this means?
It's karaoke time.

84
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,314
Yeah, buddy.
Just warming you up.

85
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,448
My friend, Darrin.

86
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,783
Oh, shit! Perfect!

87
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,418
- Hey, how are you?
- What's your name?

88
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,253
Monet.
Monet?
Of course it is.

89
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,221
Self-proclaimed...
- Party whore.

90
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,589
Yes.

91
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:44,690
What do you do?
How much?

92
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,452
I'll give you
a slice of pepperoni.

93
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,826
- Darrin.
- What?

94
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,628
Look at Reid, man.

95
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,000
Really? We're doing this?

96
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,469
You like my B? This is my B.

97
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,272
Oh, you wanna do this?
All right.

98
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,440
Reid!

99
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,509
And she's gone. Okay.

100
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,746
Do it!

101
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,947
Follow me.

102
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,522
<i>- Drop the beat. Give me a beat.
- Help me out.</i>

103
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:20,559
<i>¶ Yo, my name is Reid
I'm here with Darrin</i>

104
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,028
<i>¶ He likes his cardigans
Looking like an orange ¶</i>

105
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,310
What? Reid!
Fucking pussy, he left.

106
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,112
Now that really killed
the party.

107
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,418
Whoo!

108
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:53,959
Where is Reid, man?
Do you see him?

109
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,727
I have no idea
where he is.

110
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:56,528
All right, this is Michelle.
Michelle is...

111
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,297
Nicki.

112
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,333
Nicki. Nicki is from...
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

113
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,495
Look, dude, it's Reid.

114
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,037
- Is he really?
- Reid.

115
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,506
Reid. That's what
he was wearing. Reid. Yo.

116
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,388
You think he's got
a girl with him?

117
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:11,810
That's trippy...

118
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,744
He's just drunk.
Whatever.

119
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:13,879
Don't worry about it.

120
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,047
He's not responding, man.

121
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,289
Well, text him again.

122
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,511
Did you see Reid?
Reid, where are you?

123
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,454
Reid. It's not Reid.

124
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,623
Sorry, I'm sorry. Ben.

125
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,726
Come on, already. He probably
just went home or something.

126
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,448
So much fun, man.
Dude, did you see
my cannonball?

127
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,965
Look at this road.
We're, like, in the middle
of nowhere land.

128
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,033
That's what I was
saying earlier.

129
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,368
I don't know
where the fuck I am.

130
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,003
Maybe you shouldn't
have gotten...

131
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,539
What if Reid's lost
in the forest?

132
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,840
I think he is lost
in the forest.

133
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,475
So I was trying to
fucking look for him.

134
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,776
I think he's loving
a woman right now.

135
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,511
I don't know where I'm going.

136
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,579
I need to make
a booty tex-age.

137
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,647
Oh, shit!

138
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,750
Dude! What are
you doing, man?

139
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:52,984
What? What?

140
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,353
Is that Reid?

141
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,721
That's fucking Reid.

142
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,881
Fuck. What is Reid doing
in front of the car?

143
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,105
What's going on?

144
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,568
Hey, you all right, man?

145
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,002
Yeah.

146
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,571
Are you stoned?

147
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,356
Did you get really
fucked up at the party?

148
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:16,140
I thought you
were with that girl
this whole time.

149
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,924
Reid, what happened,
dude?
Let's go home.

150
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:19,708
Why are you in
the middle of the street?
Are you all right?

151
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,979
Yeah.

152
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,547
Okay.

153
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,783
Okay. Let's go.
This night's fucking over.

154
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,694
Here we go. Here we go.

155
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,028
You're ready to go?
Yeah, I'm good.

156
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,096
You boys ready to
get this started?

157
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,464
Ben, have you packed?

158
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,966
I'm good.

159
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,534
Ben, is that really
all you're bringing?

160
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,102
It's all I need, gents.

161
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,004
Suitcases are overrated.

162
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,441
Let's see.
Cowboy boots, bandanas,
and a pink wristband.

163
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,942
You're good to go.

164
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,043
All the necessities
of life, man.

165
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,512
Put it in your bag.

166
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,080
- You wanna borrow?
- No.

167
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,549
I like my trash bag.
I think it's classy.

168
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,885
I could have
made this website.

169
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:00,986
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

170
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,120
You're packing a lot of stuff.

171
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,639
We're gonna need
all these suits.

172
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,157
Yo, Darrin.
I wanna show you
something I found.

173
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,458
A little story
for you guys.

174
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,460
Iraqi insurgent thinking,

175
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,929
"I'm gonna do some
terrorist activity here
against Americans."

176
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,831
Uh, they think
no one can see 'em.

177
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,666
Where are you going
with this?

178
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,469
So, I think they remind
me of you and Reid.

179
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,671
"We're fine. It's
nighttime. You can't see us.

180
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:23,475
"Who can see at night?"
And...

181
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:27,512
"No! What's happening?
No! Run! Run, Ahmed.

182
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,481
"Oh, Ahmed, you're dead too."

183
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,782
And that,
my friends, is what happens

184
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,883
when you fuck with
the American government.

185
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,151
They fuck you up.

186
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,786
They're not gonna
be able to see us.

187
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,755
'Cause we got these.

188
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,989
I have a plan.
There's always a plan, Ben.

189
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,724
Sure, there is.

190
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,093
Got to take this.
Whassup?

191
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,563
No, we're going out of town
for the weekend.

192
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,932
Secret mission.
Yeah, that's right.

193
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,806
Hey, is Ben still
on the phone?

194
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,542
No, I cannot tell you
where we're going.

195
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,264
It's a pretty good
opportunity to try
this thing out.

196
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,484
Sure. I don't
think girls...

197
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,485
I'm just
gonna find his frequency.

198
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,687
What? Really?

199
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,121
Ready.

200
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,661
- Ready.
- Ashley?

201
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,763
Told you it would work.

202
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,885
All right,
I'm going to cut it off.

203
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,902
Let him get back on the phone.

204
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,974
Hey, sorry,
I don't know what happened.

205
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:32,644
Yeah, we'll definitely...
Mini-golf date is set.

206
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,083
God damn it.

207
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,858
Stupid phone.

208
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,221
What are you guys doing?

209
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,223
The jammer works.

210
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,760
We need flashlights.

211
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,763
What are
the tennis balls for?
Don't worry about it.

212
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,598
Four cameras. Yes.

213
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,935
Six batteries.
Two, four, six, yep.

214
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,338
You really need
four cameras?

215
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,740
Wearable. So we can
attach to our clothes
whatever, under our arm.

216
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,241
Comes pretty handy.

217
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,044
And, as you can see,
that is you.

218
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,812
- Sweet. There I am.
- There you are.

219
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,534
It will come in
handy at some point.

220
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,284
There's so much
cool shit on this table.

221
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,766
Ben, be careful
with that, all right?
Just don't drop that.

222
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,558
Okay, pills.

223
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,859
Just three, just three.

224
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,294
Okay, I'm good.

225
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,229
Darrin, where are you?

226
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,864
Dude, we got to
get going.

227
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,265
Come on out, buddy.

228
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,603
Dude, those ammonia pills
are brutal.

229
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,972
You're doing a lot
of work there, Darrin.

230
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,640
It's an essential
part of the trip, Darrin.

231
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,175
Hey, when did
we get this?
Taser gun?

232
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,811
Taser. God, I love America.

233
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,147
Don't mess with
that thing, all right?
Oh!

234
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,749
Careful.
Careful, dude.

235
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,651
You can shock yourself.

236
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:47,819
Do you really think that
can fuck someone up, though?

237
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,220
Yeah.

238
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,990
Come on. Come on,
let's get packing.

239
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,762
Dude, are you
all right?

240
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,364
Okay, that hurts a lot.

241
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,298
Are you okay?

242
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,933
Oh, man!

243
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,095
Oh, that will work.
That will take someone out.

244
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,371
Feel like I'm
more of a man now.

245
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,039
It does really work.

246
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,307
That's what you
look like right now.

247
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,069
Never leave dangerous toys
around children.

248
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,380
Let's go.

249
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,783
You nervous?
Huh?

250
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,018
We're doing it.
We're doing it.

251
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,286
It's gonna be awesome, dude.

252
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,621
This is what's gonna happen.

253
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,023
We're gonna drive
up to the border,

254
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,125
or wherever I'm dropping
you guys off,

255
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,727
uh, say our goodbyes.

256
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:29,828
You're gonna get
out of the car,

257
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,629
Reid's gonna get
out of the car.

258
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,015
Walk about 15 feet,

259
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:35,400
and then you're both gonna
be shot in the head by
snipers in the hills.

260
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,901
And I'm gonna be
crying in the car

261
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,103
because my two
best friends are dead.

262
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,137
We're not gonna
get shot, all right?

263
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,639
You'd cry for us?

264
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,140
The worst that could
happen is we get arrested.

265
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,908
And we're not gonna
get arrested 'cause
I got a plan.

266
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,945
It would be easier to rob
a bank than to break
into Area 51.

267
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,680
And people that
rob banks get shot.

268
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,181
That's 'cause a bank
expects to be robbed.

269
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,950
Nobody expects anyone
to break into the base.

270
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,785
That's because
it's impossible.
Ben, look at this.

271
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,021
Look at all this
land mass here, okay?

272
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:59,124
How are they
gonna patrol all that?
It's not possible.

273
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:00,325
This guy we're gonna
meet tomorrow, Norio,

274
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,160
walked across at daylight.

275
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,129
It's the size of Connecticut.
You can't patrol all that.

276
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,830
It's a top secret
government base.

277
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,666
There's probably a bunch of
other things happening...

278
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,734
There's no way they have dudes
all around this circle.

279
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,936
Yeah, there's motion sensors,
there's ammonia sensors.

280
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,172
There's all kinds of
security measures, but
we're gonna get around it.

281
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,441
You're gonna get around it
until you're shot in the head.

282
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,009
You guys are all talk.
This is never gonna happen.

283
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,978
I understand that

284
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,346
Reid's gone a little crazy
in the last three months.

285
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,714
No offense, Reid.

286
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,449
Who wouldn't want to see this?

287
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:27,452
You wouldn't want to see
footage of Area 51 inside
of the base?

288
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,754
I don't understand why
you're so confused
why I wanna go.

289
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,756
Because this has been,
this has all happened
very quickly,

290
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,191
and suddenly
we're going there.

291
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,394
And I don't know why
you have just accepted it.

292
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,997
All I know is that
no one has ever seen
footage of the base.

293
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,033
No one's ever been there.
No civilian's ever seen it.

294
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,402
We could be the first ones
to do it. That would be
the biggest...

295
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,804
What could be
bigger than that?

296
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,173
Really good job
manipulating Darrin, Reid.

297
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,341
Just drive us
to the border, okay?

298
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:54,112
Hello? We're, uh, about
a couple hours from Vegas.

299
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,247
Yeah, he's talking
to that girl again.

300
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,949
She's not crazy.
You've never met her before.

301
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,751
Yeah, but he hasn't either,
man. He trusts her.

302
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,386
He already told her
what we're doing
and everything.

303
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,254
I don't know why he thinks
this girl's so legitimate.

304
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,023
You know,
her dad worked there.

305
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,859
No, her dad wrote a book
and claims he worked there.

306
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,394
You guys don't know anything
about this chick.

307
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,930
You're just trusting her.
I can make a fucking website.

308
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,264
Even if she shows up,

309
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,365
Reid doesn't really know
anything about her.

310
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,500
What's the deal, dude?

311
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,035
We're good.

312
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,403
She's gonna meet us tomorrow.

313
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,138
Just because
someone wrote a book...

314
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,340
If he went to MIT and did work
for the government,

315
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,410
it makes sense that
he'd be able to write
a legitimate-sounding book.

316
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,279
That doesn't mean
it's legitimate.

317
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,148
Well, that's what
we're trying to find out.

318
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,016
And then he killed himself,
so he's clearly stable-minded.

319
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,051
You don't have actual...

320
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,103
Ben, Ben, Ben, okay.

321
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:37,154
We know how to get past
the security measures
outside the base,

322
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,224
but we don't know what to do
when we get on the base.

323
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,860
I need his information.
She's the only one who has it.

324
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:45,296
So if she is full of shit,
we can go home?

325
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,998
If she's full of shit,
we gotta find another way.

326
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,967
You don't have
to say anything to her.

327
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,202
Oh, I'll say something to her.

328
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,537
Don't. Don't do dick.

329
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,172
Please don't.

330
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,944
There we go.

331
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,046
I talked to, uh,
Glenn Campbell.

332
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,448
Okay.
The guide,

333
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,049
and he's gonna
show us this, like...

334
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,451
Who are all these people
you're talking to?

335
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,486
Cameras, wearable cameras.

336
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,220
I'll wear one,
and you wear the other.

337
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,488
Okay.

338
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,990
We'll check for night vision.

339
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,291
There's no way
I'm wearing one.

340
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,492
You can get that shit
into a strip club

341
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,311
and the bouncers
and all that...

342
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,129
There's a lot of security
at strip clubs, I know,
trust me.

343
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,964
And if you can get
that shit in there

344
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,566
and no one finds out,
you're gold.

345
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:25,837
Okay! Vegas!
Enough Area 51 talk!

346
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,839
That's the least
I've ever been excited
about going to Vegas.

347
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,908
Look at this.
Just like Candyland.

348
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,410
Look at that.
Take a picture of that beauty.

349
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,245
- Hi, guys.
- How you doing?

350
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,247
How are you?
We're gonna check
in for the Hooters.

351
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,316
Oh... Wow.

352
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,517
Beautiful.

353
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,386
Kidding me? No way.

354
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,822
Dude, this place
is ridiculous.

355
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,056
There's a pool table?

356
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,258
There's a pool table!

357
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,193
Reid,
what are you doing, dude?

358
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,062
Check it out.

359
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,930
This is what I was telling you
about. It's JANET airlines.

360
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,265
You guys kidding me right now?
We're in heaven.

361
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,568
Going to look at boobs.
What are you doing, weirdo?

362
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,469
Dude, check out
this thermal feature
on the camera.

363
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,871
Let me see.
See, it's picking up
your heat.

364
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,005
Crazy.

365
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,240
I got an idea.

366
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,609
Let me know if
it picks this up.

367
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,377
Oh, God!

368
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,879
This is not gonna
be pretty.

369
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,347
Now look.

370
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,015
That looks like boob prints!

371
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,917
Those are my blueprints!

372
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,119
Seamless
Gentlemen's Club.

373
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,241
We good?

374
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,290
Can't see anything.

375
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,029
Dude, move.
You're blocking my view.

376
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,151
Let's go in
the private room.

377
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,600
Nice. Night vision.

378
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,169
Better get some
ladies in here soon.

379
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,136
I'm gonna be doing
this the entire time.

380
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,371
- They coming in?
- Yeah.

381
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,073
They better come in soon.

382
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,174
Hey.
Ready for some fun?

383
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,876
Hello, hello.

384
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,510
Yeah, I think
he needs a lap dance first.

385
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,511
That guy needs
a little bit first.

386
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,180
This guy?

387
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,582
Do these guys first.
I'll go after.

388
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,652
All right, all right.
I'm not gonna complain.
That's fine.

389
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,054
You know,
I'm happy regardless.

390
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,056
You are
a gentleman and a saint.

391
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,358
You are a gentleman.

392
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
And a very good friend.

393
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,295
Hope you have
a good view over there, Reid.

394
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,098
I am looking at it.

395
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,300
Looking and experiencing
are two different things.

396
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,555
See, Reid, it's a...

397
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,907
I don't know, but that
was the greatest
moment of my life.

398
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,475
Do you know how much
trouble we could have
gotten in for this?

399
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,010
To Vegas.
To Vegas.

400
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,178
To best friends.
To the trip of our lives.

401
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,584
Rise and shine. Ben.

402
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,288
Hey.

403
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,322
What?

404
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,490
Get up.

405
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,392
What are you doing?

406
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,093
Oh, man,
you look beautiful.

407
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,095
Why are you recording
me right now?

408
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,197
Look at all the fun
we could be having
walking down the strip,

409
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,632
drinking some beers.

410
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,935
She's there. She's texting me.

411
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,703
She's not crazy.

412
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,138
How do you know that, man?

413
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,706
'Cause I've talked to her.

414
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,208
We have no idea
who we just sent
our best friend to meet.

415
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,510
Let's hope she
can help us, right?

416
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,472
Yeah, what if this is
a setup or something?

417
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,215
Does he know
what she looks like?
How is he gonna...

418
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,952
I don't know.
Oh, wait, that's her.
Shaking hands.

419
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,320
- Have you zoomed in?
- Yeah.

420
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,687
What does she look like?
She doesn't look crazy.

421
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,589
Does she look crazy?
Are her eyes glowing?

422
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,959
No, she doesn't look crazy.
She looks normal.

423
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,428
Well, hopefully,
she's not legit or
he freaks her out.

424
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,362
And then we can go home.

425
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,697
Right.

426
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,466
He's pointing at us.
Should we wave?

427
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,735
She has something.
She gave him something.

428
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,370
She gave him papers
or something.

429
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,238
Yeah, he's bringing her
out here.

430
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,307
Okay, dude, just act
normal, all right?
Don't be a dick.

431
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,676
It's gonna be really
hard not to be a dick.

432
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,495
He's bringing her out here.

433
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:22,313
She's looking all sketchy.
They both look real sketchy.

434
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,514
So this is Jelena.

435
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:24,549
What's your name?
Jelena.

436
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,517
- Jelena?
- Darrin.

437
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,219
Hi, I'm Jelena.
Nice to meet you.

438
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,687
Good to meet you.
All right, guys.
Uh, follow me.

439
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,156
Okay.
Just like that?

440
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,038
She's not shady.
Is she, Reid?
Yup.

441
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:38,162
Well, apparently,
we're going into storage.

442
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,764
'Cause nothing good happens
at a storage facility.

443
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,499
Case in point,
have you ever seen
<i>Silence of the Lambs?</i>

444
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,600
It's one girl, okay?

445
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,534
She could
very easily kill us.

446
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,569
And store our bodies.

447
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,170
We can take her.

448
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,332
Well, I know if a gun
gets pulled out, I'm running.

449
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,576
He became really paranoid.

450
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,745
He kept talking about how
our phones were tapped

451
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,346
and how there were
people following him

452
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,515
and all kinds of
crazy stuff like that.

453
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,585
And he made me promise
that if anything were
to happen to him,

454
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:03,654
I would move all his stuff
to a storage facility.

455
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,224
Somewhere secret
that no one would
be able to find.

456
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:09,027
He was extremely adamant
that I did it right away.

457
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,497
So the night that he died,
I brought his stuff over here.

458
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,633
And, it's crazy,
literally within 24 hours,
our house was raided.

459
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,735
They want what's here.

460
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,384
He was fired for asking
too many questions.

461
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,557
I was the one that found
my dad in the garage
that night.

462
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,161
Look at this.

463
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,662
They ruled it as a suicide.
He would have never
killed himself.

464
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:45,563
This whole thing's
been redacted.

465
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,831
I know.

466
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,473
- Your father?
- Yeah.

467
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,804
Looks like a nice guy.
Mmm-hmm.

468
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,705
Yeah, he was a really
good guy.

469
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,377
Holy shit! This is a timeline
of all the employees.

470
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,645
This is incredible.

471
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,346
Thousands of people's
medical records.

472
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,149
Malignant prostate?

473
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,484
I don't know why
he'd have that.

474
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,618
- Come here.
- What?

475
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,722
Yeah, these are my dad's
maps of the base.

476
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,091
Seriously?

477
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,162
Of course, he wasn't
allowed into all the buildings

478
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,131
but this is what he's got.

479
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,233
Everything above
ground is just a front.

480
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,168
The real base is
a mile underground in S4.

481
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,736
He wasn't allowed in there.

482
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,706
Marked different
staircases and elevators.

483
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,341
That could be how
you get underground.

484
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,076
It would be real helpful
when we get to the base.

485
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,810
Even if you make
it on the base, this isn't
going to help you.

486
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,613
You need fingerprints.
You need a badge.

487
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,582
They have access codes
that change every day.

488
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,550
Well, your dad
didn't have access to it,
so he obviously snuck in.

489
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,119
Yeah,
and my dad's dead.

490
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,420
You really want to
go through with this?

491
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,822
Yeah, I don't have
a choice.

492
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,225
Looks like your dad
was able to get into S4

493
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,160
but just not, sort of,
parts...

494
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,895
Well, he was
following someone.

495
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:54,332
This guy, I know I have
his picture in here
somewhere,

496
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,834
who did have
full S4 clearance.

497
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,870
And I know that my dad
was following him.

498
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,741
There we go. The guy.

499
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,610
I don't know his name.

500
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:06,811
I just know
that that's the guy
my dad was following

501
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,630
and the reason
why he got fired.

502
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:10,448
Well, if he does
still work there,
I think we could find him.

503
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,850
He probably lives
in or around Vegas.

504
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,421
Reid, if this is
for real, this is what
got her father killed.

505
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,426
Yeah.

506
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,494
We'll be careful.

507
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,363
Hi. Norio?

508
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,864
Yes.

509
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,766
So let's say we get to the top
of the ridge here,

510
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,301
say I want to do more
than just look at it.

511
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,470
Say I want to
get down into S4.

512
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:37,808
Get out of the car
and just keep walking
along this boundary fence.

513
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,345
Most of the heat sensors
and motion detectors

514
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,348
are along this
Groom Lake dirt road.

515
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,750
There are no motion
sensors over here?

516
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,818
There are very little.

517
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,620
Rattlesnakes?

518
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:50,755
Yes, there's rattlesnakes
all over.

519
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:51,856
S4 is down here, right?

520
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,257
S4 is down here.

521
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,793
Can we get over that mountain?

522
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,197
As long as you're
not detected.

523
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,398
The JANET airlines.
The terminal.

524
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,900
737 outbound jets right there.

525
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,302
The one with the red stripe?

526
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,903
Yes.

527
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,105
In fact, you can see
the parking lot over there.

528
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:10,942
Darrin, I think
this is his flight.

529
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,510
How do you know?

530
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,378
The tail numbers.
We gotta go.

531
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,180
- Right now?
- Yeah.

532
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,416
We got to get there
before they deplane.

533
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,178
I'm going as fast
as possible, man.

534
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,562
Take a right, take a right.

535
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,692
Am I going in there
or what am I doing?

536
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,794
Okay...
What?

537
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,395
This is it.
This is JANET terminal.
This is JANET?

538
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,331
There's a lot of cars.

539
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,699
The dude could be anywhere.

540
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,837
So they fly the employees
in and out of this base
every day?

541
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,938
Yup.

542
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,006
Here?

543
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,474
Yup, every day.

544
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,409
Who's JANET?

545
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,812
Uh, it stands for
Just Another
Nonexistent Terminal.

546
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,013
That's the rumor.

547
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,748
It's a stupid rumor.

548
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,483
I think I see him.
Can you see him
on there?

549
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,485
Yeah, yeah.
I'm zooming in.

550
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,486
White hair, glasses,
getting in a small black car.

551
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,589
Oh, shit.
Reid, Reid, it's him.

552
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,523
Right there,
right there.
Follow him.

553
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,958
Okay.

554
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,027
Give him
a little space though.

555
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,295
Put it in drive.
Here we go, here we go.

556
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,830
All right, go.

557
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,265
So I'm just
following this guy?
Yeah.

558
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,634
Can you zoom in on him?

559
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,435
Yeah. It's him, dude.

560
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,004
It's definitely him.
I can see him in his mirror.

561
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,640
He's wearing black glasses.
White hair.

562
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,522
He's the exact guy
in the picture.

563
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,278
So do you have
a plan though?

564
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,013
I got a few ideas.

565
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:24,682
Would you like to share
them or are we keeping
that to ourselves?

566
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,350
Okay.

567
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,752
What if he's a janitor?

568
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,287
He's got to be
a high-level employee.

569
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,554
What, are you just gonna
hit him over the head?

570
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,989
Dude, don't lose him.
I'm not losing him.

571
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,925
Speed up a little bit.

572
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,994
What if that guy
knew that Jelena's dad
was following him?

573
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,530
What if this is the reason
Jelena's dad was killed?

574
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,532
I suddenly don't
like this idea anymore.

575
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:42,833
You're doing a great job.
Thank you.

576
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,335
It's almost like you've
done this before.

577
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:47,405
I actually might
take up a new career.

578
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,539
Stalking people?

579
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,607
Following people?

580
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,876
Uh, PI. Thank you.

581
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,444
You don't see anything?

582
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,994
Dude, put the camera down.
Put the camera down.

583
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:02,172
All right, stay back,
stay back. Let some cars
get between.

584
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,391
Stay a good, like,
50 yards behind him.

585
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,626
More than 50.

586
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,738
Whoa, whoa.

587
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,766
You want me to
just drive past him?

588
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,248
Drive past him.
Drive past him.

589
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,906
- This is his house.
- Go, go, go.

590
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,474
- Put the camera down.
- Relax, relax.

591
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,642
Go down the end
and turn around.

592
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,110
So what's the plan,
this stakeout?

593
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,878
We wait.
For how long?

594
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,113
We gotta stick around
to see if he leaves.

595
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,715
Great.

596
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,717
Food in here, man?

597
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,786
Definitely did not plan
this stakeout very well.

598
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,621
Supposed to have coffee.

599
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,557
Supposed to have donuts.

600
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,961
Darrin, make sure
the camera is on that house.

601
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,323
- All right. I'm on it.
- Any movement.

602
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,996
What do you think, dude?
If he doesn't leave, plan B?

603
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,872
Reid?

604
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,074
Yeah, what is
the plan here, Reid?

605
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,076
Anything?

606
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,045
No, no movement.

607
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,080
Shit! We gotta take
those pills again.

608
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,149
Any food or anything
to go with this?
I mean...

609
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,784
Sorry, man.

610
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,986
Here, man, I have food.

611
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,888
Beef jerky?
Why would you not tell me
you have something?

612
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,523
Because you're gonna
eat the whole fucking bag.

613
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,958
I'm not gonna
eat the whole bag.

614
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,460
I don't remember if
you guys were there or not,

615
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:19,697
but I think I've told you
that we were making out

616
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:22,400
and I thought there
was a chair behind me
and I'd sit down...

617
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,288
- And it was a...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

618
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:28,038
Reid, where the fuck,
where are you going?

619
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,775
Reid, where...
Where the fuck is he going?

620
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,676
Shh, shh. Wait, wait.

621
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:33,918
Holy shit. He's leaving.

622
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,150
What is he doing?

623
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:41,312
Okay.
Just wait, just wait.

624
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,686
Holy shit. Where is he going?

625
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,192
Come on.

626
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,594
Darrin, what the fuck
is he doing?

627
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,696
Hold on. Oh, my God.

628
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,666
What is he doing?

629
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:56,908
Wait.

630
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,938
He's breaking in.
Darrin, we can't let him
break in.

631
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,972
I'm gonna go
help him, okay?
What?

632
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,641
Just relax, relax.

633
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,143
Look, take this.
Call me if you
see anything, okay?

634
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,105
Darrin, you can't just
fucking go in there, man.

635
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,823
Let's do this quickly.
Dude,
I can't see shit in here.

636
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,705
No lights.
Use the night vision.

637
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:27,898
Okay.

638
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,535
- This is his office.
- Yeah.

639
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,057
Fuck! It's locked.
We gotta break in.

640
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,217
What the fuck was that?

641
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:42,613
You hear that?

642
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,584
Go check it out.

643
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:58,929
Oh, fuck!

644
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,998
Help! Reid! Reid!

645
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,160
Help, Reid.

646
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,125
Throw the jerky.
Throw the jerky.

647
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,544
Fucking A.

648
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,912
Just feed her
something real quick.

649
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,647
- She's nice, she's just...
- Okay.

650
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,409
Christ!
Let's keep looking.

651
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:26,957
See anything?

652
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:32,315
Darrin,
I'll keep looking down
here. You go upstairs.

653
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,052
Toys, toys, toys.

654
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,688
Reid, you find anything?

655
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,557
- No. You?
- No. Nothing, man.

656
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,191
Keep looking.
All right.

657
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,594
Okay, come on.
Come on. Master bedroom.

658
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,070
Shit.

659
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,240
- Ben?
<i>- Darrin, they're home.</i>

660
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,676
What? What, are you
fucking serious?

661
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:19,977
<i>Dude, get the fuck
out of there.</i>

662
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,946
Dude. Reid, Reid.

663
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,081
He says they're coming back.
He says they're outside.

664
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,818
What? Wait.
I could have sworn I fucking
heard something.

665
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,720
Fuck!
They're back. They're back.
You go hide!

666
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,482
Fucking hide.
Go fucking hide, man.

667
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:36,594
What the fuck! Fucking shit!

668
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:40,097
You are so good...

669
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,632
Yeah, you are.

670
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,300
Fuck it.

671
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,911
Good girl.
Let's go brush your teeth.

672
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,246
Yeah, right here. Come on in.

673
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,982
Hey, where's
my toothbrush?

674
00:26:57,984 --> 00:26:59,784
Right there.
One more pass.

675
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:02,119
One more pass of the
toothbrush, please.

676
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,988
You're tired.

677
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,823
Okay, here we go.
You're tired.

678
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:06,924
All right, say goodnight
to the elephant.

679
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,726
Bye.

680
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:11,328
Bye-bye, all right.
Goodnight. Let's go.

681
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,963
Come one,
let's go night, night.

682
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,805
Dad will come in
and say goodnight
in a few minutes.

683
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:42,126
I haven't heard anybody
move in a while.

684
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:44,361
We shouldn't have done this.
This was dumb.

685
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,825
Jesus!
Shh, shh.

686
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:16,226
Let's get the fuck out
of here. Come on. Let's go.

687
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,795
Come on. Look.

688
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:20,064
I think he's got it in there.
I gotta go look.

689
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,265
It's his fucking bedroom.

690
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,267
It's okay. Just relax.

691
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,109
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

692
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,001
Shh, shh.

693
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:25,522
Go, go, go, go, go!

694
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,395
Start the car.
Start the car.

695
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,130
Go. Go.

696
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,065
Shit. Holy fuck.

697
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,400
I fucking got it.

698
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,569
What the fuck
just happened?

699
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:40,504
We got it.
We got it.
Got the badge.

700
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,172
I don't give a fuck
that you got the badge.

701
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,508
I mean, you just
fuckin' broke into
someone's house.

702
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,044
No. That was home invasion,
breaking and entering,
robbery...

703
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,078
We got what
we came for.

704
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,246
- They didn't see us.
- Yeah.

705
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:50,614
He works for the government.

706
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,115
Okay. But they
didn't see us.

707
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,952
It's 10, 15 years in jail.
What if they woke up?

708
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,253
Look, they didn't see...
They had a kid!

709
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:57,605
We're fine.
We're totally fine.

710
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,956
What if one of the neighbors
saw my license plate?

711
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,490
No one saw you.
How do you know that?

712
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,125
- They didn't.
- No one saw us.

713
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,861
They didn't, man.
We're fine.
Yeah.

714
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:04,995
Look, it's all good.

715
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,263
No. No, it's not.
We're done.

716
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,631
What do you mean,
done?

717
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,599
This whole plan is fucked.
I'm going home.

718
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,400
Ben, this was the plan.

719
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,935
No, this wasn't the plan!

720
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:14,004
Relax. Breathe. Jeez.

721
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,408
We're cool, okay?

722
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,540
Just head towards
the desert, all right?

723
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,047
Sorry.

724
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,049
It's not okay.

725
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,891
It's going to voicemail.

726
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:39,296
Hey, Jelena. We got...

727
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,365
We got the badge, it's on.

728
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,115
We're headed to Rachel.
Talk to you tomorrow.

729
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:58,515
Hey, Ben,
where's Reid?

730
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,557
Where is he?
Dude, he's over there, man.

731
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:04,656
Jesus.

732
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,928
What the fuck,
he's standing
right by the road.

733
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,162
I gotta go take a piss.

734
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,244
What the
fuck's he doing?

735
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,468
You have to help me
talk him out of it, man.

736
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,569
I'm not talking
him out of it.

737
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:22,072
Dude, you have
less than a day.

738
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:23,340
I'm not gonna
talk him out of it.
Dude...

739
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,501
Why'd you come with us
if you didn't want to do this?

740
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:29,479
I didn't think it was
actually gonna get
this far, man.

741
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,114
So you think
we spent three months
planning this

742
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,717
and now we're gonna
back out? Come on.

743
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,052
You really ready
for the consequences?

744
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:36,486
We have a plan!

745
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,722
Like last night?
And that worked.

746
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:41,725
Now we have
everything we need,
okay? We're here.

747
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:44,527
This is happening.
This is our chance.
Look where we are. This is it.

748
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,285
Base 5 is right over
those mountains.

749
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,101
We're ready.

750
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,238
All right.
It's all set.

751
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,613
See those
mountains over there?
Uh-huh

752
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,349
Okay.

753
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,484
On the other side
of those mountains is Area 51.

754
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,486
That's super cool.

755
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,155
We're literally in
the middle of nowhere.

756
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,423
This is, like,
where people get killed.

757
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,992
Little A'Le'Inn.

758
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,094
Oh, that's so clever.

759
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,329
It already looks
like a major downgrade

760
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,765
from the Hooters'
presidential suite.

761
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,267
Straight out of <i> Psycho,</i>
I do not wanna go in there.

762
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:25,635
What the fuck are we doing?

763
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,070
It could be
worse, dude.

764
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:28,438
What are you talking about?
This is awful.

765
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,706
This is where
people make meth.

766
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,275
It's not terrible.

767
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,611
This would be
a good home base.

768
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:35,893
What, it's just
a couple of days.

769
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:39,583
Hey, you think
we could talk to

770
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:40,868
some of these locals
real quick?

771
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:42,152
Talk to a few people.
Yeah, quickly.

772
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:43,154
All right.
Let's do it.

773
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,255
Look at this guy.

774
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,491
This guy is hanging out
by himself.

775
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,453
We should definitely
talk to this guy.

776
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,365
Hi, gentlemen,
how can I help you?

777
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,367
- Hello, how are you?
- Hi.

778
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,636
- Yeah.
- What brings you here?

779
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,671
Well, what brings
everyone here?
The aliens.

780
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,041
That's why you guys
are here, right?
With your cameras and...

781
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:07,044
Here we are, you know,
trying to pretend
they don't exist,

782
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:10,280
and I just don't
understand why.
The evidence is obvious.

783
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,815
I mean, it's even
in the Bible.
It's in Ezekiel.

784
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:14,251
You know,
"The chariots in the sky."

785
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:18,588
Why does America deny UFOs?

786
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,557
There's other countries
that don't deny UFOs,

787
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,692
why does America deny UFOs?

788
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,429
Stuff like in Mexico City...

789
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,731
Sculpture where
the guy's sitting
in the chair,

790
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,332
it's like he's sitting
in a rocket,

791
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,634
and he's got controls
in front of him,

792
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,602
he's got the breathing
apparatus.

793
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,638
People don't want to look.
People don't want to know.

794
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,674
Roswell, 1947, right?
The crash.

795
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:40,844
They move all that
stuff here in 1951.

796
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,814
We're reverse engineering
the spacecraft right now,

797
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,115
right over there.

798
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:47,451
What you see on a map?

799
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,820
That's just what
the governments are
willing to let you see.

800
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:52,122
Our government does
nothing in front of us.

801
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,523
And so, there's a lot
of hangers,

802
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:54,858
a lot of infrastructure
underground.

803
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
I would be skeptical, too,

804
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,861
if I thought there were
these comic book
little green aliens.

805
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:02,265
They're not these furry,
little sweet creatures,

806
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,903
they're scary, man.

807
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,472
The one that he saw had
rows of teeth, you know,
like, several back...

808
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:12,309
The eyes, black.
Just endless black pit.

809
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,311
It's like white blood,
you know?

810
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,712
They shed their skin.

811
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:18,381
He's like a snake,
but these giant patches...

812
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,818
It's not just
your body that they probe,
they probe your mind.

813
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,587
They can control your mind.

814
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:25,489
Throw you against the wall
out of nowhere.

815
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,857
You can tell when
they're around, too.

816
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,692
You get these
migraine headaches.

817
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:31,294
I mean, beyond anything
you could ever imagine.

818
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,096
You get nosebleeds.

819
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,897
You hear about those people
having those near-death
experiences,

820
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,401
and the whole thing about,
"Walk into the light!
Walk into the light!"

821
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:39,736
That's what that is.

822
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,305
It's almost like you cease
to exist for a bit.

823
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,773
You have no idea
what happened at the time.

824
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:44,775
It's just white.

825
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:49,679
Like eternal endless white.

826
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:52,382
You can't see
where the floor stops
and the ceiling starts.

827
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,344
How do you even know
you were on the ship?

828
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,760
You don't.

829
00:35:57,456 --> 00:36:00,524
Experimentation,
the dissection, everything
we've done to them,

830
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,592
it's Guantanamo Bay, man.

831
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,634
You just better hope
they never get out.

832
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,731
They have their own
police department,

833
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,300
they got an underground
transportation system,

834
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,701
and they have
their own government.

835
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,604
Area 51, man,
it's the 51st state.

836
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,573
Here it is.
It's right up
there on the left.

837
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:18,408
This is a little creepy,
man. What if this guy's crazy?

838
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,243
He's fine.
He's totally normal.

839
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,212
Glenn?
Yeah. You Reid?

840
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,914
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.

841
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,216
Reid's finally found
his best friend.

842
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,951
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Where are we going?

843
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:30,287
I guess you're coming
to Area 51, eh?

844
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,888
This road will take us
down to the border.

845
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,758
It's one of the main
access roads to the base.

846
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,826
What kind of security
might we run in to?

847
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,828
At the border, always
on the same hill.

848
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,430
You see the camo dudes,

849
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,332
you see two guys
in a white Jeep Cherokee.

850
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,900
Right.

851
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,635
They're always there,
24 hours a day.

852
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,238
I'll drive along with
the little frequency detector

853
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,341
and when this thing pops off,

854
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,343
it tells me,
"I just ran over
a road sensor."

855
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,545
Slow down. Slow. Slow.

856
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,587
Look around in
one of these bushes
and see if you can...

857
00:36:58,684 --> 00:36:59,684
Oh.

858
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,153
- Right there.
- Okay.

859
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,688
Oh, yeah.
If you didn't
know this was here,

860
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,290
this would look like
a plate of grass to you.

861
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,626
There's your antenna.

862
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:13,430
There's no way you'd find
this without some sort
of electronic aid.

863
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:16,533
Look at that
"US Government Property."

864
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:17,735
We're on public land,
mind you.

865
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,336
All right, there we go.

866
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:23,707
Okay.

867
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:26,643
2-0-2-2.

868
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:29,346
This was gonna
send out the code 022.

869
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:31,548
The camo dudes are gonna
come along and investigate,

870
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,450
and see who's
approaching the border.

871
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,351
This is the simple stuff
we find outside the border.

872
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:37,554
Inside the border,
you may have your
ammonia sensors,

873
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:40,023
you may have
your heat sensors.

874
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:44,461
If you can defeat this unit
out here on public land,

875
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,863
you'd probably
be able to defeat
what they have inside.

876
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,632
There's a car
over there.
That's them.

877
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,400
That's the camo dudes?
Those are
the camo dudes.

878
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,702
I'm not gonna
get a sniper bullet
in my head right now, am I?

879
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:54,537
Just pull over on to the side
of the road, right here.

880
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:55,779
Just pull up to that area.

881
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,508
Is there a guy there?
Can you see?

882
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,644
You got a, uh,
telephoto on that?

883
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:01,745
Yeah, I zoomed in
on him.

884
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:03,230
Can you see if there's...

885
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:04,714
They even got
the binoculars on us
right now.

886
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,716
Really?
Two guys, right?
Yep.

887
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,852
Up there in that ridge,
there are two tripods.

888
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,553
There's one.

889
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:11,721
One of them is
pointing toward us.

890
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,823
And there's
another one right there.

891
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,924
The other one is
pointing toward the road
we just came down.

892
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,628
So, if you have a vehicle,
there's no real sneaking in.

893
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,663
We're really getting out
of the car right now?

894
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,364
Yeah.

895
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,733
These are your
camo dudes up here.

896
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,302
Are you the happiest
human being ever, right now?

897
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,970
- Yeah.
- This is amazing.

898
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,637
Right over there.
Everything you've ever wanted.

899
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,707
This is almost as exciting.

900
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,325
Yeah.
This could be
used against you...

901
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:33,942
If I had a choice,
I'd be at a pool
in Vegas right now.

902
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,045
We made it to the border.

903
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,847
Oh, there's
another one.

904
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,092
We're tourists, guys.
Sorry.

905
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,327
So, what brings you out here?

906
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,628
Oh, work.

907
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,830
So, I'm really just out here.

908
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,699
Since I was close,
I decided I should

909
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,534
come by and do
the touristy thing...

910
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,736
You guys have fun.

911
00:38:58,737 --> 00:38:59,857
Okay. All right. Thanks.

912
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,574
Here's a guy
with no license plates.
Yeah, you're a tourist. Sure.

913
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,775
That guy is
a security guard, huh?

914
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,444
Undercover.

915
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:08,878
Just don't do
anything stupid, okay?

916
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,746
You got it.
Thank you, Glenn.

917
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,081
Later.

918
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,523
See, I told you
he wasn't weird.

919
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:20,457
Right over there.
It's so close.
I can taste it.

920
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,492
- Now let's go talk to that guy.
- What?

921
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,361
Huh?
Let's go talk to
this guy. Come on.

922
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,083
Err...

923
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,701
Hey, uh, sir, what are
you looking for?

924
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,246
See anything?

925
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,084
You think I wanna come
out here? They make me
come out here!

926
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,519
Okay. All right.
Let's go.

927
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,676
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

928
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,557
Don't talk to the locals.

929
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,027
Ben, don't antagonize
strangers like that, dude.

930
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,662
What? I didn't know
he was gonna be crazy, dude.

931
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:00,463
The door's open.
What?

932
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:01,731
Did you leave it open?

933
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:02,832
No.
We have all our
stuff in there.

934
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,074
I didn't leave it open.

935
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:07,287
Dude, open the door.

936
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:08,368
You kidding me?

937
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:11,041
- Hello?
- Fuck.

938
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,122
Dude.
Anybody here?

939
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:16,413
It looks the same.
It's all here,
I think.

940
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,481
It's everything.

941
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,483
What if someone fucking
bugged the place.

942
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:21,684
Hello?

943
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,188
What the fuck?

944
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,790
Hey.
Hey.

945
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,491
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus Christ!

946
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:29,893
Dude, are you...
I knew you'd get here.

947
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:31,461
Hi, guys.
What are you
doing here?

948
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,562
Yeah. What are you doing here?

949
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:33,830
We gotta get moving.
Let's go.

950
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:35,598
- I'm coming with you guys.
- What?

951
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,567
I asked the guy
up front.
Fuck.

952
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,569
They've got ammonia sensors
all over the base,

953
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,538
so these neomycin pills
will mask our ammonia levels.

954
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,173
Okay.
Darrin and I have
been taking them

955
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,807
for a few days now,
so we're gonna have
to triple your dosage.

956
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,609
Well, are they
gonna work?

957
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,511
Hopefully. Might have
to test your levels
before we leave.

958
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:50,673
Keep moving.
We have a lot to do.

959
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:51,981
Terrible idea.

960
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,918
Darrin, you need to take two.

961
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,553
Say something, man.
You shouldn't...

962
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:58,054
I don't know
what that is.

963
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,590
Just tell him that
it's not okay with you, dude.

964
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:01,891
Hey.

965
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,093
Maybe we don't
bring her with us.

966
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:06,062
What?

967
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,164
We shouldn't bring her.
We don't need her with us.

968
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,132
What are you
talking about?

969
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,067
She's gonna get us caught.

970
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,001
She's not gonna get us caught,
we have the Freon suit.

971
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,505
So what? That's not a good
enough reason, okay?

972
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:17,674
Dude, we can't tell her no,
okay? She's helped us out,

973
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,742
she gave us all the stuff,
she gave us the maps.

974
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,644
Okay. Well,
the ammonia pills, okay?

975
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,580
The level's gonna
be way too high.

976
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:25,882
I know, all right?
We'll test her before we go,

977
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:26,616
if it doesn't test out,
we won't bring her.

978
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:27,984
Okay.

979
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,220
Darrin. Look, I'm
trusting you guys

980
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:32,822
with everything
my dad left me.

981
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,524
This is all her stuff,
we wouldn't be able to do

982
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,826
any of this without her.

983
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,695
Look, you guys have
your reasons, all right?

984
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:41,498
And I have mine,
and I need to do this.

985
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,132
I just... I don't want
to be here

986
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,667
if you really don't want
me here.

987
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,749
I think she could help us.

988
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,072
You really think so?
Yeah.

989
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:50,314
I know I can.

990
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:53,877
Ready for a 9-mile hike
there and back?

991
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:55,778
It's 11 miles. And, yes.

992
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,860
We good?
It's fine.

993
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,649
- Is it in?
- Yeah.

994
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:01,184
Like an actual
motion sensor?

995
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,185
Like, we went to
the border and took one.

996
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,267
You're kidding.

997
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:07,023
There she is.

998
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,345
All right, we jammed
the signal.

999
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:11,928
What?

1000
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,730
It changes frequency
after, like, 30 seconds.

1001
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,098
What does that mean?

1002
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,933
It means we have
to detect the signal,

1003
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:20,270
jam it, and then disable it
before it changes frequencies.

1004
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:25,041
Fuck.

1005
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,123
Look, nobody said
it was gonna be easy.

1006
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:29,579
So, this is the access card
we got off your
dad's friend there.

1007
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:30,947
And that...

1008
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,189
This is his cologne.

1009
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:34,118
There you go.

1010
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,770
Did you get it?
Can't tell.

1011
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:42,191
Look in the light.

1012
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:43,826
Yeah. There it is.

1013
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:45,295
Yeah. There she is.

1014
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:47,931
That's a good one.
You see it, Darrin?

1015
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,666
You guys,
there's someone by our car.
What? What?

1016
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,228
There's someone
sneaking around our car.

1017
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,869
Where is he?

1018
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:54,871
Dude,
he's right there, man.

1019
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,853
There's stuff
in the car.

1020
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,331
Doesn't matter,
it's not...

1021
00:42:59,332 --> 00:43:00,787
What do you mean,
it doesn't fucking matter?

1022
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:02,243
Come on, we gotta keep moving.
We got stuff to do. Let's go.

1023
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:05,114
Where is he?

1024
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,716
I don't know.
I don't see him. He's gone.

1025
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:28,838
Keep going. Just keep going.

1026
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,907
He's messing with us.

1027
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,909
Thermal cameras
all around the base,

1028
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:35,211
and they pick up
your body heat.

1029
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:37,313
So what we're gonna
do is, we're gonna
pump Freon through this suit.

1030
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:40,116
Fit in right here,
and that'll mask
our body temperature.

1031
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,384
Darrin, turn on the Freon
and put on the thermal?

1032
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:42,386
Yep. Good.

1033
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:45,189
All right.

1034
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,826
- How's it looking?
- It's looking good.

1035
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:51,411
You can see the Freon
coming through.

1036
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:52,995
I can see your body cooling
down, it's kinda cool.

1037
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:55,298
Only problem is,
it's escaping
through your head, so.

1038
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,540
All right.
Let's try the mask.

1039
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:00,904
All right.
It's helping.

1040
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:02,405
There we go.

1041
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,073
Good?

1042
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,942
Hey, hold on.
Let him just tie it off.

1043
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,644
It's sweet.

1044
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:08,945
- Coming through her whole suit.
- It's coming in?

1045
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:10,146
Her whole suit
looks pretty good.

1046
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,347
It's like it is matching
the outside.

1047
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,789
All right. It should
all work then.

1048
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,387
We should probably
bring along boots.

1049
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:20,223
Hold on to the ammonia sensor,
we gotta check Jelena.

1050
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:21,265
Let's do it.

1051
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:23,793
Dude, let's go.

1052
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:27,764
What?
I'm not doing it.

1053
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,900
What do you mean
you're not gonna drive us?

1054
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:32,035
I'm not gonna drive you
until you tell me
why you're doing this.

1055
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:33,836
You know why we're doing this,
they're hiding secrets
out there.

1056
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,805
I need a better reason
than that.

1057
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,773
I'm not gonna drive you
there unless you tell me
why you're doing this.

1058
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,442
You said you would do it.

1059
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:42,211
Yeah. I didn't know
we were actually
gonna get this far, Reid.

1060
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:43,880
I thought you were
gonna snap out of it.

1061
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:46,002
You saw a light at a party,
that's all I know.

1062
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,386
I don't really know.

1063
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:54,323
Something happened to me
that night, all right?

1064
00:44:54,325 --> 00:44:57,093
I just... A whole
bunch of missing time,

1065
00:44:57,095 --> 00:45:00,296
and I get these
flashes, and...

1066
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:02,265
I don't know, something is
pulling me towards the base.

1067
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,434
I can't explain it, okay?
I just have to do it.

1068
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:06,703
I do. And I can't
do it without you.

1069
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,566
So, please,
can you just help me?

1070
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:11,275
Please.

1071
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,445
Please, help me.

1072
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:24,188
Let's go.

1073
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:33,097
Here.

1074
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:38,868
It's close, but I think
you'll be good.

1075
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,110
Take this for your walkie.

1076
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,274
- You guys in?
- Yeah.

1077
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:46,859
- Yeah.
- I hear you.

1078
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,443
Now watch out for them, man.
Don't let them do
anything stupid.

1079
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,113
No, I'll be fine.
All right. I'll be here.

1080
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:52,415
All right,
guys, put on your masks.

1081
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,117
All right.

1082
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,439
Yeah. You see the Freon
pumping through the suits.

1083
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:00,389
Good luck, man.

1084
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:01,290
Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

1085
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:03,126
I'll be here in the morning.

1086
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:04,968
Right.
We'll see you then. Be safe.

1087
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:07,196
I'm gonna head this way,
over that hill.

1088
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:09,132
All right, guys, this is it.

1089
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:10,294
Let's do it quickly.

1090
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:20,395
Holy shit. We're
doing it. We're doing it.
We're doing it.

1091
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,003
Guys, this way.

1092
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,289
Wait a minute.
Guys, there's a fence.

1093
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:41,798
There's a fence.

1094
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Yeah, right there.

1095
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:43,881
Straight ahead.

1096
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,335
- You see it?
- Yeah.

1097
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:48,737
Shit. It's coming up
all hot in the thermal camera.

1098
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:52,058
I think it's electric.

1099
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,575
It's on the way?
Shit.
We gotta go that way.

1100
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:55,445
You serious?

1101
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,313
This fence goes all
the way to the right
and all the way to the left.

1102
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,382
We gotta
find a way under it.

1103
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:01,217
Let's keep looking.
Look for a low,

1104
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:02,552
like, a ditch or something
like that.

1105
00:47:02,554 --> 00:47:04,053
Right here.

1106
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:05,975
I think we can get under it.

1107
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:07,617
All right, you're through.

1108
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:10,393
- Nice, okay.
- Ready?

1109
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:11,395
Stay low, Reid.

1110
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:12,829
Am I clear?

1111
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,071
Yeah. Just stay low.

1112
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:15,531
Let's keep moving.

1113
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:16,533
Let's go. Let's go.

1114
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,144
Okay. Everyone, stop.
Everyone, stop.

1115
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,913
You see that? The light.
It's a car, we're fine.

1116
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:32,849
Look, they're just
driving along the road.

1117
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,350
If we tripped their sensor,
they'd be on us.

1118
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,118
Check the GPS.

1119
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,386
Okay, it's this way.

1120
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:41,785
Hey. Hey.

1121
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:45,962
It's okay.
Just keep breathing.

1122
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,203
Are you okay? Can you breathe?

1123
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,933
Come on, let's go.
What are you doing?

1124
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,134
Okay.

1125
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,572
I think we'll
be getting close
to the motion sensors.

1126
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:58,541
About
six miles from the base.

1127
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,423
Jelena's right,
we're getting close.

1128
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,284
Stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1129
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:09,966
Twenty seconds, Stay there.
Stay there.

1130
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:12,890
Reid.

1131
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:19,896
I think I got it.
Come on. Come on.

1132
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:21,364
Reid, 15.

1133
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:25,368
Moving too fast.

1134
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,936
- Reid, hurry.
- Five,

1135
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:30,339
four, three, two, one.

1136
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,514
All right.
I think I got it, guys.

1137
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,676
Did you get it?
Yeah, I got it.

1138
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:46,222
All right. All right,
let's keep moving, guys.

1139
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:48,324
It's three miles that way.
Almost there.

1140
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,028
Wait, guys.
Stop. Stop. Shh, shh.

1141
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,062
You hear that? You hear that?

1142
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:54,263
What is it?

1143
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:57,099
Are those camo guys?
The camo.

1144
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,285
You can tell.
That doesn't look
like them...

1145
00:48:59,286 --> 00:49:01,470
Holy shit!
It's a helicopter! Get down!
Get down! Get down!

1146
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:02,939
Keep your head down.

1147
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:04,507
They can't see us
in the thermal suits, okay?

1148
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:06,208
Stay down! Stay down!

1149
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,677
We're gonna be fine.
Jelena, keep your head down.

1150
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,245
Stay low. Don't move.

1151
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:14,771
There's a snake.

1152
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:17,687
It's okay.
It won't hurt you.

1153
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:24,093
Stay calm. It doesn't even
know you're here.

1154
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,166
Is it gone?

1155
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:31,801
It's going away.
It's going away.

1156
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,435
Relax, relax. Try to breathe.
Just breathe.

1157
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:35,504
You guys,
the helicopter,
it's coming back.

1158
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:38,441
All right, guys,
stay down. Be still, okay?
Stay down.

1159
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:40,409
We're not gonna get caught.
Stay low.

1160
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:47,450
Look, they're just
doing a routine check.

1161
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:49,118
It's a standard procedure.

1162
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,286
God damn it.

1163
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:54,056
See? They're gone.

1164
00:49:54,058 --> 00:49:56,259
Still, they definitely know
we're here.

1165
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,461
No, it's a fly-over.
They would've
flown down on us.

1166
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:00,663
We're fine.
They do it all the time.

1167
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:03,393
It's right over that ridge.

1168
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:15,244
There it is. Look.
We fucking did it.

1169
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:18,695
- I told you we could do it.
- We made it.

1170
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:22,018
We did it. We fucking did it.

1171
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:24,254
Reid, you were right.

1172
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:27,089
I mean, this is
Area 51. This is the base.

1173
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:28,491
Darrin,
you getting this?
Yeah.

1174
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,226
This is a huge area.

1175
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:32,128
You see that area down there?
That's where we're going.

1176
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,170
We gotta get down there
and ditch the suits.

1177
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,336
There it is.
We made it.

1178
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:43,572
I can't believe we did this.

1179
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:45,041
You sure we're okay
without our suits?

1180
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:46,509
Yeah, we should be fine.

1181
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:47,610
They shouldn't have
heat sensor

1182
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:48,444
cameras this close
to the base.

1183
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:49,686
And security?

1184
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:53,549
Security should be low
this time of night.

1185
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,271
Let's get inside there
and get some footage.

1186
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,286
Reid? Reid?

1187
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,756
Reid, you all right?
You good?

1188
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:01,758
Yeah, let's go.

1189
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:08,397
Looks like we're good here.

1190
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,533
But I'm gonna go up
to the fence and
check it out, okay?

1191
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:11,567
Do you realize
what we're doing
right now?

1192
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,702
I know.

1193
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:16,465
Do we just go?
All right. Wait.
He's over.

1194
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:18,140
He needs to signal us
or something.

1195
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:19,742
No, no, no.
Just wait. Just wait.

1196
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,704
He's almost over.
Come on, hurry up.

1197
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,599
Here we are on the base.
This is incredible.

1198
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,835
Darrin, check that way,
I'll check this way.

1199
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:47,757
All right, Darrin,
please get down.

1200
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,773
There's people
everywhere.

1201
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,615
Stay low.
Let's get over there.

1202
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:56,312
It's a car.
Reid, you see that?

1203
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:57,546
- Fucking...
- Damn it.

1204
00:51:57,548 --> 00:51:59,228
Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck.

1205
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:05,674
Just keep it down.

1206
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:07,223
Keep going. Keep going.

1207
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:08,591
Right. There's the split.

1208
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:10,526
All right, keep a look out,
I'm gonna check the map.

1209
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:11,760
It's hangar
number nine.

1210
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:12,862
Guys,
we're fucking here...

1211
00:52:12,864 --> 00:52:13,729
It's the hangar
on the east end...

1212
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,464
East end?

1213
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,333
Let's get to that fence
and don't freak out.

1214
00:52:17,335 --> 00:52:18,301
- We're so close, all right?
- Okay.

1215
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,462
- We gotta hurry.
- Go.

1216
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:25,514
You need to get
in the shadow here.
Come get in.

1217
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:31,294
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1218
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:33,697
Can you see 'em?

1219
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:35,651
Okay.

1220
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:36,619
Their backs are turned.
Now's time for us...

1221
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:37,621
Go!

1222
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,524
What's the plan?

1223
00:52:41,526 --> 00:52:42,691
Okay. You go left.

1224
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:44,426
Okay. Okay. Going.

1225
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:48,397
All right.

1226
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:49,532
It's nine down.

1227
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:50,733
It's there?
Yes.

1228
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:53,702
It's JANET planes.

1229
00:52:58,242 --> 00:52:59,775
Shit. Shit.

1230
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:01,710
Okay. Okay.

1231
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,071
- I think they're leaving.
- I think so.

1232
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:18,627
He's taking the car.

1233
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:19,728
He's taking the car.

1234
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:35,928
All right.

1235
00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:36,544
I can't see anything.

1236
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,307
Look for a light
on the wall.

1237
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:40,683
Here, I found it.

1238
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:42,318
Nothing in here.

1239
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,652
Look for doors
to other rooms.

1240
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,414
You guys,
this one opens.

1241
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:50,859
Oh, Reid,
it looks like...

1242
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:52,061
Does this thing open?

1243
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:54,697
We use the fingerprint.

1244
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,607
Why isn't this
working, come on.

1245
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:05,809
Maybe it needs my body heat.

1246
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:12,414
Go. Go.

1247
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,750
Shit.

1248
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:19,489
Stay behind me.

1249
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,433
The door just closed on us.

1250
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,802
Fuck.
It's okay. Just keep
going. Keep going.

1251
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,407
Level 40-A.
We need level 40-A.

1252
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:39,575
Got it.

1253
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:46,202
I don't see anything.
Where is it?

1254
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:56,733
Okay. Okay.

1255
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:58,694
Fuck.

1256
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00,329
There's a guy out there.
He's at his desk.

1257
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:01,830
He's by himself. Okay.

1258
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:04,433
We need to get
to a stairwell.

1259
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:05,435
All right.

1260
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,471
- Dude, he's gone.
- What?

1261
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,473
He's fucking gone.
I have no idea where he is.

1262
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,442
- Did you see which way he went?
- I have no idea...

1263
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,044
Come on.
Come on. Let's...

1264
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:16,726
Hurry up, hurry up,
hurry up...

1265
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:18,695
What the fuck?

1266
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:21,551
Okay, we're good. We're good.

1267
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,387
What is this?

1268
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:28,023
Comatose,
nonresponsive behavior,

1269
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:30,859
marks on necks and arms?
What the fuck.

1270
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:37,900
You guys,
we got to get out of here.

1271
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:41,337
Shh. It's okay. Just...

1272
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,579
He didn't notice us.
He's wearing headphones.

1273
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,644
Okay here. On 10.

1274
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:50,579
Yeah. We gotta find a way.
We gotta get to a stairwell.

1275
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:53,415
Okay. There's
an exit over there.

1276
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:55,817
There's an exit over there?
Behind you,
behind you.

1277
00:55:58,622 --> 00:55:59,622
It's a dead end.

1278
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:05,761
Get down. Get down.

1279
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,764
Okay, we're clear. Get down.

1280
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:14,104
Shit!

1281
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:22,879
Shit. Shit.

1282
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,918
Go, go, go, go.

1283
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,694
Fuck, that was close.

1284
00:56:38,696 --> 00:56:40,656
Dude, it goes way
the fuck down there.

1285
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:42,464
This is Stairwell B.

1286
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:45,667
S4, it should be down there.

1287
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,777
- Let's keep moving.
- Yep.

1288
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:09,772
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

1289
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:12,027
Reid, he's coming. Reid.
Reid, he's coming.

1290
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:32,448
There's a locker room.
I think it's empty.

1291
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:33,450
Okay.

1292
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:37,553
He didn't see you,
did he?

1293
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:38,554
No, no, no, no.
I think we're good.

1294
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:39,556
Jesus Christ!

1295
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,705
Just wait it out for a minute.
Let everything pass.

1296
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:48,176
- What the fuck is that?
- Did you hear that?

1297
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,147
Must be automatic.

1298
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:24,500
Listen.
What's that?

1299
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,268
- What is that?
- Yeah.

1300
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,551
Where is it
coming from?
Here.

1301
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,694
- What is it?
- I don't know.

1302
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:36,759
What the fuck.

1303
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:38,941
It's still here somewhere.

1304
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,193
It's here.

1305
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:54,663
They might be useful
to know where the guards are.

1306
00:58:56,967 --> 00:59:00,202
Also got some kind of suit.
Bulletproof vest, almost.

1307
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,644
- What the hell?
- Look at this.

1308
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:06,241
What the fuck?

1309
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:07,843
Are you okay?

1310
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:10,045
Dude, your nose
is bleeding, are you okay?

1311
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,015
- Hey, let's go.
- You okay?

1312
00:59:13,017 --> 00:59:14,049
Jelena, put it back.
Let's go.

1313
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,250
The stairs. Let's go.

1314
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:24,586
All right.
I think we're good.

1315
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,702
Dude, what was that noise?

1316
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:38,087
I don't know.
Let's keep moving.

1317
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,184
Dude.

1318
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,290
I can't see anything.

1319
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:59,361
This is it. Level 40.

1320
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,400
Where are you going?

1321
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,949
This is fucking...
It's huge.

1322
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,279
Shit.

1323
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:18,748
Look at this.

1324
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:21,216
It's fucking... What is this?

1325
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,719
Are these cages?
What the fuck?

1326
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:24,953
Yeah, they look like
holding cells.

1327
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:25,955
Dude!

1328
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:29,124
Oh my God, it's weird.

1329
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,892
Oh! They're hot,
they're hot.

1330
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,196
Dude,
it's fucking warm.
That's weird.

1331
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:36,264
Darrin, check this out.

1332
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:38,066
Holy shit.
What is this?

1333
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,970
That's weird.
What do you think's in there?

1334
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,406
It's like they're
getting sucked in.

1335
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:46,908
Come on. We gotta keep moving.
Let's go.

1336
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,830
We gotta get through
the lab to get to
the access point for S2.

1337
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:53,555
Oh, fuck. Go hide.
Get down.

1338
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,179
What's he doing?

1339
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,015
I think he's going
to the lab.

1340
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:13,442
Is he still out there?

1341
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:17,339
I don't know the code.
It's not a card.

1342
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,621
I have an idea.
With the thermal.

1343
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,042
Yeah.

1344
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:33,255
Okay, now.

1345
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:34,356
Maybe the thermal...

1346
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:35,457
What do you mean?

1347
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:37,292
Watch. I turn it on.

1348
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,828
Now, the last button he pushed
would be the warmest.

1349
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,264
Eight must have been
pushed first, and then
the seven,

1350
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:44,366
and then the three,
and then the four, okay?

1351
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,334
So that means what?
4-3-7-8.
Right.

1352
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,809
Fuck! You're a fucking genius!

1353
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:54,811
Go!

1354
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:03,953
It's a lab.

1355
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:10,325
My dad always
talked about these R&D labs.

1356
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:12,194
- Look at this shit.
- Whoa.

1357
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:13,829
- My God.
- Whoa, this is...

1358
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:15,063
What?
Holy shit.

1359
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,431
Look at this.
Anti-gravity.

1360
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:17,766
This is huge.

1361
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:19,034
I knew it.

1362
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:20,302
My God, I knew
he wasn't crazy.

1363
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:21,970
- My dad was right.
- I knew it.

1364
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:23,805
Why are they hiding this here?

1365
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:25,507
Dude, there's
white blood in there.
We gotta go.

1366
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:27,008
We don't know
that it's blood.
I know,

1367
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,110
but remember the guy
at the bar mentioned that.

1368
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,211
Yeah, maybe that's it,
I don't know. Okay.

1369
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:30,345
Guys, we should get moving.

1370
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:31,947
- No.
- Where?

1371
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:32,965
Reid, this is
the first thing we've seen.

1372
01:02:32,966 --> 01:02:35,247
- Let me get some footage.
- Hold on a sec.

1373
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:37,285
There's more over here.

1374
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:39,354
Jelena, look at this.

1375
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:40,436
There's more over here.

1376
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,059
What the fuck?

1377
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:45,994
What?

1378
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:48,930
Are you seeing this?

1379
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:53,301
It's the craziest shit
I've ever seen in my life.

1380
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:55,103
Look at this.

1381
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,471
Reid, come here, man.
Check this shit out.

1382
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:58,140
Darrin, come over.
Check this out.

1383
01:02:58,142 --> 01:02:59,841
Guys, you gotta come see this.

1384
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:01,877
Guys,
this thing's going crazy.

1385
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:03,639
Reid, look at this.
Look at this.

1386
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,553
Oh!
Fuck.

1387
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:13,121
What the fuck?

1388
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,156
I don't know.

1389
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:20,796
What was that?
Fuck!

1390
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:21,930
You guys, we gotta
get the hell out of here.

1391
01:03:21,932 --> 01:03:23,131
You all right?

1392
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:24,032
- Shit.
- Reid, we need to go.

1393
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:25,233
What was that?

1394
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:26,635
Someone heard that, right?

1395
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,036
You all right?
We gotta get out
of here, come on.

1396
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:29,871
Guys, we gotta go, yeah.

1397
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:31,306
Let's go.
Wait, wait,
wait. Wait.

1398
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,474
Darrin.

1399
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:33,975
Come here, come here.

1400
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,143
Darrin, come on.

1401
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:36,478
That thing just flew.

1402
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,000
The rock flew?
What the hell
was that?

1403
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,484
Holy shit.

1404
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,366
Darrin, Darrin.
Look for a door.

1405
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:55,130
No fucking way.

1406
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:57,132
Holy shit.

1407
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:58,300
- You think it's real?
- Look at this.

1408
01:03:58,302 --> 01:03:59,601
I don't know.
I gotta get a closer look.

1409
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,336
Holy shit.

1410
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,571
Wonder how long
they've had this here.

1411
01:04:02,573 --> 01:04:04,056
That's crazy.

1412
01:04:04,057 --> 01:04:05,540
Do you realize
how many people would
want to see this?

1413
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:06,942
I can't believe I'm
filming this right now.

1414
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:08,704
Look at this.
This is incredible.

1415
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:12,414
- So how did they fly this...
- Guys! Guys!

1416
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:13,615
Come, check this out.

1417
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:15,183
You gotta see this,
this is crazy.

1418
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:17,319
Look.

1419
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:18,420
Oh, my God.

1420
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:20,705
Holy shit.

1421
01:04:20,706 --> 01:04:21,288
That was incredible.

1422
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:22,371
It's definitely not...

1423
01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:25,026
From this planet.
That's incredible.

1424
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,862
It's not doing
anything for me.

1425
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:29,598
This is not
military technology.
This is something else.

1426
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,320
Dude, I gotta
get in here.

1427
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:37,405
Hold on, I think
there's an opening up here.

1428
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,191
Amazing.

1429
01:04:39,192 --> 01:04:40,976
I'm gonna go in.
Reid, you don't
know what's in there.

1430
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:42,210
It's okay. I'll be fine.

1431
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:44,172
Okay, just
be careful, dude.

1432
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:46,181
Easy, easy.

1433
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,354
Holy shit.

1434
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:54,222
- What?
- Jelena, it closed.

1435
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,657
What do you mean,
it closed?

1436
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,509
I mean, the door,
the hatch, it closed.

1437
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:59,360
Just, he climbed in and
it closed right behind him.

1438
01:04:59,363 --> 01:05:01,043
I don't...
It's just not there anymore.

1439
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,072
What are they?

1440
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:07,168
They look like sleeping pods.

1441
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,240
There's like nothing in here.

1442
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,242
Why there's, like,
no controls or anything?

1443
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:19,481
I can't believe I'm
in an alien spacecraft.

1444
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:24,185
Check this out.

1445
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:30,626
Whoa!

1446
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:33,295
Darrin.

1447
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:37,532
My God, it's completely
soundproof.
This is amazing.

1448
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:42,337
Well, is there, like, a...
Like, a button or something?

1449
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:44,372
I don't know.
It's just... It's all smooth.
It's nothing.

1450
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:46,608
It's nothing.
Come on, what the fuck?

1451
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,943
What is he doing?

1452
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,245
Hey! You guys!

1453
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:51,947
You guys, this is amazing!

1454
01:05:53,016 --> 01:05:54,176
How did I do this?

1455
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:03,959
Reid.
Darrin.

1456
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:05,493
You all right?
Darrin, man, you gotta
get down here.

1457
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:06,962
- This is amazing.
- No, we gotta go, man.

1458
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:07,996
No. I'm not leaving.

1459
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,297
Could you guys see me?

1460
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,499
- No we couldn't see you.
- Reid, come on.

1461
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,700
Dude, the whole
thing went transparent.

1462
01:06:11,702 --> 01:06:13,501
No, man, it was
completely soundproof.

1463
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:14,986
All right,
we gotta go.

1464
01:06:14,987 --> 01:06:16,470
Reid, if that door
closes again, we're
stuck here. Let's go.

1465
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,473
All right.

1466
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,275
Here. Here.

1467
01:06:20,277 --> 01:06:22,177
You okay?

1468
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,545
I told you guys
it would be here,
I told you that.

1469
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:24,679
Let's go, Reid.

1470
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:26,214
There's gotta be more.

1471
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:27,615
- I was just inside that thing.
- I know.

1472
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:30,251
We got it all on tape.
Let's go.

1473
01:06:30,253 --> 01:06:33,053
They definitely heard us.
They're gonna seal
that shutter down.

1474
01:06:34,558 --> 01:06:36,524
What the fuck was
that back there?

1475
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:37,692
Think about it.
That was definitely
not from this planet.

1476
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:39,327
I know. Exactly.

1477
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,979
We have enough footage.
We have to look for an exit.

1478
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,630
We gotta keep going.
This is what we talked about.

1479
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:44,672
You're talking way
too loud, someone's
gonna hear us.

1480
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:45,888
Quiet.

1481
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,436
Careful, careful.

1482
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:53,608
- Here, come on.
- Guys, we can't stop.

1483
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,477
I know, I know.
Check them out.

1484
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:57,559
Somebody's
gonna see us.
Check it out.

1485
01:06:58,215 --> 01:06:59,080
It's this way. Let's go.

1486
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:00,082
Go, go.

1487
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:03,051
Reid, look up.

1488
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:07,175
Are you okay?
Yeah.

1489
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:08,757
Come on.
Darrin, you with us?

1490
01:07:08,759 --> 01:07:09,959
Yeah, it's all right.

1491
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:13,812
Let's go.

1492
01:07:13,813 --> 01:07:15,693
Come on,
we'll be running for miles.

1493
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:17,432
Just look for
an opening.

1494
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:19,300
Fuck.

1495
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:23,779
Look.

1496
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:25,707
This is that.

1497
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:26,709
Holy shit, you're right.

1498
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:27,950
Come on.

1499
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:29,718
Let's go.

1500
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,420
This is gotta be it.

1501
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:36,378
- You good?
- Come on, Darrin.

1502
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,580
We're clear.

1503
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,242
What's up?
Wait. Wait.

1504
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:48,663
What's wrong?
Do you hear that?

1505
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:50,632
Hear what?

1506
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:51,833
Just...
We gotta go,
we gotta go.

1507
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:53,568
Come on. Keep moving.
You okay?

1508
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,890
- We're close.
- Okay.

1509
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,582
Dude, stop.
Reid, there's
a fucking camera.

1510
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:09,584
There's someone
here, come on.

1511
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,306
Reid, this is bullshit.
We gotta go.

1512
01:08:12,656 --> 01:08:14,289
Come on, we gotta go.

1513
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,291
Darrin, I'm not leaving now.
We've come this far.

1514
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:18,760
Come on, we'll get
the fuck out of here.
My God, man.

1515
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:21,563
Security's gonna come
down here and see us.

1516
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:23,098
Stop...
It's the fingerprint scanner.

1517
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,432
Hurry. Fuck.

1518
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,767
Fuck.

1519
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:27,168
Okay, it's okay, Darrin.

1520
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:30,171
It's gonna detect my pulse.

1521
01:08:30,874 --> 01:08:31,874
Go, go!

1522
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:35,497
Come on, follow me.

1523
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:37,579
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Okay.

1524
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:41,616
- What was that?
- It's a failsafe.

1525
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,418
Someone has to
turn that thing on.

1526
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,700
I'll do it,
I'll do it.
All right.

1527
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:46,788
Jelena, come on.

1528
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,510
- Go.
- Come on.

1529
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:03,752
What the fuck?

1530
01:09:04,508 --> 01:09:06,407
Darrin, come on. Darrin!

1531
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:07,842
Okay, what do I do?
What do I do?

1532
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:09,277
- Listen, are you okay?
- Go!

1533
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,612
Go, they're coming!
Get out of here!

1534
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,147
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Hey!

1535
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,615
- You! Freeze!
- Shit, shit.

1536
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:15,250
- Get down! Get down!
- Freeze!

1537
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,254
Oh, God.

1538
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:22,891
<i>Security breach S4.</i>

1539
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:24,826
<i>Security breach S4.</i>

1540
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:26,294
Get out!

1541
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:27,395
<i>Security breach.</i>

1542
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,400
<i>Security breach.</i>

1543
01:09:32,402 --> 01:09:33,434
Dude,
I can't see anything.
Hold on.

1544
01:09:33,436 --> 01:09:34,569
Let me get the flashlight.

1545
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:36,271
What about Darrin?

1546
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:37,639
He's going back
to the car. We'll meet
him there.

1547
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:38,673
Fuck.

1548
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:45,914
What? What the fuck?

1549
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:46,916
What's going on?

1550
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:53,821
Don't go over there.

1551
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:54,589
They're just
hanging there.

1552
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:55,591
What?

1553
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,480
Just hanging,
they're not real.

1554
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:00,409
I don't get it.

1555
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:05,007
They're rubber.

1556
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:10,305
Maybe... Maybe they wear it
when they go out on Earth,
I don't know.

1557
01:10:10,307 --> 01:10:12,947
You know, like,
an astronaut
wears on the moon.

1558
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:14,943
They're not real.

1559
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:26,689
It's moving.

1560
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,326
Where the fuck
are we going?

1561
01:10:31,328 --> 01:10:32,408
God, I can't believe...

1562
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:39,367
And it's not opening,
that's great.

1563
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,635
That's fucking creepy.

1564
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:49,677
What is this place?

1565
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:52,447
Your dad talked
about this.

1566
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:54,449
He said they had all these
tunnels down here.

1567
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,360
Oh, it smells
down here.

1568
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:01,956
What if there's someone
down here?

1569
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,359
Okay. Let's try to
keep quiet.

1570
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,273
There's nothing in here.

1571
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:26,281
Wait, why are these,
down here?

1572
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:27,915
No.

1573
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,025
Oh, my God. Glasses.

1574
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,774
Shoe.

1575
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:54,609
It's a
little girl's shoe.

1576
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,100
- Oh, my God.
- Reid.

1577
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,723
Why are there clothes
down here?

1578
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,719
What are they doing here?

1579
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:07,588
This isn't right.

1580
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:13,695
Come on, stay close.

1581
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:24,572
Oh, God.

1582
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:25,694
Oh, God.

1583
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:27,942
This is fucked up.

1584
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,984
It's like some
fucking twisted playroom.

1585
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,083
Oh, God.

1586
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:37,618
I used to have this doll.

1587
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:41,689
Why do they have this shit?

1588
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,124
They bring them...

1589
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:44,446
I need to
get out of here.

1590
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:45,893
Jelena, hold on.

1591
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:47,095
Stay close to me.

1592
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:58,973
Oh, my God.

1593
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:06,914
There's fresh blood.

1594
01:13:07,784 --> 01:13:09,050
Oh, fuck.

1595
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,092
Don't look in there.

1596
01:13:11,121 --> 01:13:13,621
Can we get out of this room?

1597
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:15,123
Yeah.
I think I need to
get out of here.

1598
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:16,391
Okay.
Oh, my God.

1599
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:17,492
Okay.

1600
01:13:19,763 --> 01:13:21,796
We gotta find another way out.

1601
01:13:21,798 --> 01:13:23,758
Maybe there's another way out
through this room.

1602
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:41,115
These are the same pods
that were in the spacecraft.

1603
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:44,018
Reid.

1604
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,586
Do you think
we should be in here?

1605
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:46,954
Oh, my God.

1606
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:48,723
There are dozens down here.

1607
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:50,958
There could be
a whole colony of them.

1608
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,860
Reid,
one of them's open.

1609
01:13:53,196 --> 01:13:54,196
Shit.

1610
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:58,872
We need to get
out of here.
Okay.

1611
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,206
Oh! Fuck.

1612
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:07,041
Come on, run, run. Go! Go!

1613
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:08,443
Find a place to hide!

1614
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:10,445
Reid!

1615
01:14:10,713 --> 01:14:12,013
Reid!

1616
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:17,819
What? What?

1617
01:14:17,821 --> 01:14:18,953
Do you hear that?

1618
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,588
No.

1619
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,823
- You don't hear that?
- No.

1620
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:22,825
Shh, Shh.

1621
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:27,728
Reid...

1622
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:30,498
Let's get out here.
Let's go.

1623
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,620
Come on, come on. Go on.

1624
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:36,037
Come on, come on.

1625
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:37,879
Come on, hurry.
Hurry, come on.

1626
01:14:42,846 --> 01:14:45,112
We gotta go.

1627
01:14:45,114 --> 01:14:46,834
We gotta get
the fuck out of here.

1628
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:54,989
What the fuck?

1629
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,991
What was that?

1630
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,259
We're going to
get out of here.

1631
01:14:58,261 --> 01:14:59,794
Okay?

1632
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:08,503
Flashlights not working.
I'm gonna try on night vision.

1633
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:10,271
What is this?

1634
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:11,839
We gotta find a way.

1635
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,040
This is nothing,
it's a box.

1636
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:14,162
What is this thing?

1637
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,779
What? Don't...
Don't... Don't touch it.

1638
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:20,021
What the fuck is this shit?

1639
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,086
Here.
Pull that, pull that.

1640
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:26,220
What?

1641
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,126
- Fuck. I can't hold it.
- Okay.

1642
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:34,208
That.
Okay. Okay.

1643
01:15:39,636 --> 01:15:41,476
Okay, leave
the hatch open.

1644
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:44,732
You okay?
Yeah.

1645
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:48,023
I just wanna get
the fuck out of here.

1646
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:53,334
We're gonna have to rely
on the night vision, okay?

1647
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:56,284
There's gotta be
another way out.

1648
01:15:56,286 --> 01:15:57,852
- Oh, my God.
- God.

1649
01:15:57,854 --> 01:15:59,054
We'll go out this way.

1650
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,323
Let's go.

1651
01:16:03,626 --> 01:16:05,466
Easy.
We need to get out of here.

1652
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:06,795
Come on, follow me.

1653
01:16:09,032 --> 01:16:10,032
You okay?

1654
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:13,601
No.

1655
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:20,975
Okay! Okay, I've got it.

1656
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:34,789
Move, move, move!

1657
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:48,303
Freeze!

1658
01:16:50,873 --> 01:16:52,773
Freeze! Turn around!

1659
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,375
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, it was chasing me!

1660
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:56,210
- Put your hands up!
- Turn around!

1661
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:58,812
It's chasing me,
it's right behind you!
Turn around!

1662
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,952
Fuck. Okay.

1663
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:02,377
Fuck.

1664
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:16,824
Oh, fuck.

1665
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:19,293
Fuck.

1666
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:23,197
What the fuck?

1667
01:18:31,074 --> 01:18:32,074
Fuck!

1668
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:33,874
What the fuck?

1669
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:02,336
Okay.

1670
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:03,738
- Damn.
- Shit.

1671
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:14,181
Where are we going?

1672
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:16,952
Just keep going.

1673
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:20,087
Just stay close.

1674
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,322
Point the camera
over there.

1675
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:22,189
'Cause I can't really see
where I'm going.

1676
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,457
Yeah, yeah.

1677
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,327
What? What?

1678
01:19:27,497 --> 01:19:28,763
What is it?

1679
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:33,534
Go back that way.

1680
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:35,269
Why?
Back that way, please.

1681
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,470
Oh, my God.

1682
01:19:45,314 --> 01:19:46,781
Hold on.

1683
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:48,282
Jelena, hold on.

1684
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:52,019
What? What's wrong?

1685
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:53,320
I...
What?

1686
01:19:54,257 --> 01:19:55,422
The floor.

1687
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:56,490
What about it?

1688
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,894
I got you. Damn it.

1689
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:04,846
Reid!

1690
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:20,154
Where is this?

1691
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:22,049
What is this place?

1692
01:20:22,418 --> 01:20:23,918
Oh, God.

1693
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,252
God, I don't like this.

1694
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,226
What is this stuff?

1695
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:33,327
Skins.

1696
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:35,296
You, what?

1697
01:20:35,298 --> 01:20:36,864
This one seems fresh.

1698
01:20:36,866 --> 01:20:38,465
We need to get out of here.

1699
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:39,507
I can't see anything.

1700
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:45,539
Reid, what's that noise?

1701
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,107
Reid.
Come on, give me the camera,

1702
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:48,576
stay behind me.

1703
01:20:48,578 --> 01:20:49,898
We'll get out here,
stay together.

1704
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:51,245
Okay.

1705
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:54,581
Where is that sound
coming from?

1706
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,016
Come on!
God!

1707
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:57,551
Run! Run! Run, run!

1708
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:11,585
These symbols on
the wall. Do you see
them? Look.

1709
01:21:12,168 --> 01:21:13,934
Look.

1710
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:15,576
Reid?
Stay behind me.

1711
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,340
Look at this.

1712
01:21:19,342 --> 01:21:21,822
These are the same symbols
as the ones your dad drew.

1713
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:28,156
Do you see them?

1714
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:31,459
Jelena...

1715
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:35,289
Jelena?

1716
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:37,958
Jelena?

1717
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:41,562
Jelena?

1718
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:43,465
What the fuck?

1719
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:44,632
Jelena!

1720
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:47,534
Jelena! Jelena!

1721
01:21:47,536 --> 01:21:49,436
Jelena! Jelena!

1722
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,413
Okay. Okay.

1723
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:07,054
Shit.

1724
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:20,334
Go!

1725
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:42,203
Fuck. Fuck.

1726
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,359
Oh, God.

1727
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,366
I don't know... I don't know
where the fuck they...

1728
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:54,201
I don't know where Ben is.

1729
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:55,502
Ben...

1730
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:56,704
Jelena? Jelena!

1731
01:22:57,606 --> 01:22:59,239
Come on, where are you?

1732
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:06,213
Jelena! Jelena!

1733
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:09,116
Jelena.

1734
01:23:10,086 --> 01:23:11,518
Jelena, come on.

1735
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:15,149
Jelena, we gotta get out
of here, come on.

1736
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:16,623
Jelena?

1737
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:19,460
Jelena.

1738
01:23:21,998 --> 01:23:23,163
Jelena.

1739
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,133
Jelena?

1740
01:23:27,203 --> 01:23:28,502
Jelena?

1741
01:23:29,772 --> 01:23:31,372
Jelena?

1742
01:23:31,374 --> 01:23:32,673
Jelena...

1743
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:34,608
Oh, my God.

1744
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,313
Oh, shit.

1745
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:41,315
Jelena?

1746
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,626
No! No, Jelena!

1747
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:53,761
No!

1748
01:23:53,763 --> 01:23:55,396
Jelena!

1749
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:57,798
No! Jelena! Fuck!

1750
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,166
No!

1751
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,686
Fuck.

1752
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:20,688
Ben!

1753
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,692
Ben.

1754
01:24:41,644 --> 01:24:42,676
Fuck.

1755
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:44,445
Ben!

1756
01:24:45,181 --> 01:24:47,114
Ben! Wake up.

1757
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:49,451
Start the car!

1758
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:52,453
Star the car. Come on, go.

1759
01:24:52,455 --> 01:24:53,821
Go. Go. Go.

1760
01:24:53,823 --> 01:24:55,322
Darrin, what's going
on, man?

1761
01:24:55,324 --> 01:24:57,124
What...
Where is Reid and Jelena, man?

1762
01:24:57,126 --> 01:24:58,559
I don't know, man.
Just drive, dude.
Wait. What? Hold on.

1763
01:24:58,561 --> 01:24:59,626
Someone was
chasing me.

1764
01:24:59,628 --> 01:25:00,661
They're behind us?

1765
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:02,096
Yes! They're after us!

1766
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:03,530
Okay, I'm fucking going!
We have to go!

1767
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:05,566
What... Can you tell
me what happened?

1768
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:08,402
We were there
and then the alarm went off,

1769
01:25:08,404 --> 01:25:09,503
and started getting chased.

1770
01:25:09,505 --> 01:25:10,604
And, so we split up.

1771
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:11,672
We were there, we made it.

1772
01:25:11,674 --> 01:25:13,173
To the base?

1773
01:25:13,175 --> 01:25:14,541
We made it to
the lower levels and...

1774
01:25:14,543 --> 01:25:16,143
You got inside?
Yeah.

1775
01:25:16,145 --> 01:25:17,845
And we hit an alarm.

1776
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:19,713
Did Reid get caught?

1777
01:25:19,715 --> 01:25:21,381
We got split up. I...

1778
01:25:21,383 --> 01:25:24,184
I don't know. Okay?
We got...

1779
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:25,486
What are you doing?

1780
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:26,720
I'm not doing anything.
What the fuck?

1781
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:27,654
Dude, I'm not.
Dude!

1782
01:25:27,656 --> 01:25:29,123
Calm down.

1783
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,424
What?
Fuck.

1784
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,127
What the... What the fuck?

1785
01:25:34,263 --> 01:25:35,429
What the fuck?

1786
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:43,904
Get back in. What is...

1787
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:45,572
Darrin... What are you...

1788
01:25:45,574 --> 01:25:48,142
Darrin, get in the car!
Darrin!

1789
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:50,844
Darrin, get in the car!
Darrin!

1790
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:52,646
What are you doing, man?

1791
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,181
Darrin, get back in the car!

1792
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:55,183
Oh!

1793
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,356
Oh!

1794
01:26:02,358 --> 01:26:03,624
No! Fuck!

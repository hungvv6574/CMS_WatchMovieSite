Right now I'm moments
away from death.

No reason for you
to feel bad, though.

15
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,624
I mean, I don't.

16
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,432
This is actually
the first time in my life

17
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,004
that I've accomplished something
I set out to do.

18
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,341
And it's fitting for me
to die here in Lake Wamsutta

19
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,844
because, to be honest,
it's probably the only place

20
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,096
I ever really felt alive.

21
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,057
I used to come here
with my dad when I was a kid,

22
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,018
but we didn't
come here to fish.

23
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,062

00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,109
to the Loch Ness monster.

27
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,153
But Wammy was real.

28
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,405
We had actual footage
shot by my dad,

29
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,200
plus eyewitness accounts
from local alcoholics.

30
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,704
My dad saw the good
in everything.

31
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:06,083
He taught me that the world
was a safe and decent place.

32
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,960
Only it wasn't.

33
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,588
He got sick and before I knew it...

34
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,840
he was gone.

35
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,426
My brother Lucky
comforted me that day

36
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,970
for the first and only time
in his life.

37
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,223
But he couldn't
take my dad's place.

38

00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,236
I used my art to express myself

49

Meanwhile, I was being tortured
by the school bully,

I moved as far away
as I could

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,143
and I never thought
of Wammy again.

54
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,063
It was a silly thing
to believe in anyway.

55

As you can tell
by where I am right now,

56

my shoulder into his chest.

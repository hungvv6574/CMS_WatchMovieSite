just leave me alone.

40
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,160

41
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,260
I had to.

42
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,981

Hey, that's my spot.

Move your ass.

51
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,600
What's your problem?

52
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,703
You don't wanna make new friends?

53
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:35,854
- He's higher than you.

54
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,259
- Pussy.

55
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,665
I told you to move,
motherfucker.

56

- Bro, I think he's deaf.

57
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,972
- Move.

58
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,624
Or I'm taking your eye.

59
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,464

motherfucker?

64
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,633
- Stop.

65
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,975
- Who the fuck are you?

66
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:21,115
- You're gonna kill him.

67
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,396

69
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,109

Officer.

71
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,896
Officer. Stop. Here.

72
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,552
- What's the matter, kid?

73
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,652
Everything alright?

- Oh, fuck. I'm outta here.

76
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:14,554
You handle this.
- Stop. Nobody move.

77
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,906
What the fuck is going on here?

78
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:25,808
- He attacked me.

79
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:27,710
It was self-defense.

80
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,246
- He attacked you?

81
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,497
- I'm telling the truth.

82
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,970
- You goddamn liar.

83
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,989
Who is he?
- I don't know, some drifter.

84
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,597
- Jesus, he's not breathing.

85
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:49,697
- Fuck him.

86
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,406
- What the hell
are you waiting for, dumbass?

87
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:59,075
Grab him before somebody sees us.

88
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,175
Move.

91

- Lieutenant, we got a 16-14...

92
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,142
...     on progress on Taylor and Seasons.

93
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,643
We need your assistance.

94
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:10,713
- Send Robinson.
He should be in that area.

95
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,978
- Negative, lieutenant.
Robinson is off duty, sir.

96
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,420
- Okay, I'm on my way.

97
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Shit.

98
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,460
Cover him up.
I'll finish it later.

99
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,995
- I can take care of it.

100
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:28,631
- You can't even wipe your own ass.

101
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,731
Go home, now.

102
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,118

Ma. Wake up, ma.

108
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:04,927
- Shh.
- Ma.

109
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:07,832
- Leave me alone,
I just got home.

110
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:09,765
- I need you to come.
- Later.

111
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:12,301
- Mom, it's an emergency.

112
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,336
- Who is this man?
- I don't know.

113
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,072
He came to the house
asking about Ana.

114
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:18,908
- Ana?

115
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,110
- Yeah, then he was stabbed at the park.

116
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,112
- And you brought him here?

117
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,914
You have to take him to the hospital.

118
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:26,982
I can't treat him here.
- I can't.

119
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:28,551
There was a cop there.

120
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:30,452
And he was the one
trying to hide his body.

121
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:32,288
If I take him to the hospital,
he's gonna find him.

122
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:35,024
- I don't wanna have
anything to do with the police.

123
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,625
- Please, mom,
just do what you can...

124
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:38,294
...   and I'll get him out of here soon.

125
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:41,579
I promise.
- Oh, God.

126
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,800
Okay, just get me the first-aid kit.

127
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
- Alright.

128
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:52,374
- No, don't -- don't touch me.

129
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,474
I'm sick.

130
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,867
Don't touch my blood.

131

[Martin grunts]...

133
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,764

134

Or I'll kill you both.

135
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,571
- Mom.

136
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,074
- Why the hell
would you bring him here?

137
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,575
- I'm sorry.

138
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,278
- You should have left him
where you found him.

139
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:32,268
What where you thinking?
You idiot.

140

[sighs]...

141
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:35,885
...   - You're right.
I'll take him to the hospital.

142
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:38,136
- Don't. Not yet.

143
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,023
Wait until it's dark.

144
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:44,013

- Fuck.

165
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,718
- What did he do?

166
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,188
- He followed us,
and he took your friend.

- You're not doing shit.

- Breakfast.

anything anymore.

Eva?

186
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,655
[sighs]...

187
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,576
...     - What?

188
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,478
[sniffles]...

189
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,383
...- What am I gonna do with you?

190
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,799
Next time you're out.

191
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,455
I won't allow you to fuck it all up again.

192
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:36,024
I just can't.

193
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:38,794
I thought you were done with this shit.

194
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:41,954
- It was just this once --
- Save it.

195
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:47,174
You heard me.
Next time you're out.

196
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,592
[telephone ringing]...

197
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:05,744
...   - Morning, Harris.
- Uh, hey, lieutenant.

198
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,791
- How's everything
in our humble little town?

199
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:11,260
- Peaceful.

200
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,695
Ran a little fender bender
over on Fourth and Burwash...

201
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,398
...  but nobody got hurt,
thank God.

202
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,498
- Nothin' else?

203
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,502
- No.

204
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,838
- Nothing last night?

205
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,938
- No.

206
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:30,114
At least not according to Russell's report.

207
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,047
Why, did you heard something?

208
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,150
- No, just checkin'.
Thank you.

209
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,052
- Oh, the chief called from Black River.

210
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,755
He said he's gonna stay out
there a couple more days.

211
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:42,124
Thank God his wife's surgery
went so well, huh?

212
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:43,458
- Oh, good, excellent.

213
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:45,327
Give him my best if he calls again.

214
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:47,427
- Yeah.

215
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,715
[dog barking]...

216
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,677
...     - Peter.

217
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:04,279
It's dark, take him out now.

218
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:06,589
Make sure nobody sees you.

219
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,682
- Okay.

220
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,176
Hmm, hello?

221
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,146
Sir?

222
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,956
[dog barking]...

223
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,512
...      Eva.

224
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:39,822
[glass shattering]
- Peter.

225
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:42,317
- What happened?

226
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,852
- There's someone outside.

227
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:46,672
- Come on out,
you little faggot.

228
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:53,328
- What do you want?
- We want you.

229
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:54,863
Fucking rat.

230
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:57,566
Get your ass out here, or else
we're comin' in for you.

231
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,534
- I'm calling the police.
Go away.

232
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:01,336
- Go ahead, bitch, do it.

233
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:03,572
And I'll burn your house down.

234
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:05,907
- No, no, no, no, no.
You'll only make it worse.

235
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:07,142
I'll take care of it.

236
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,345
- If you're not out here in 10..

237
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:12,830
...I'm smoking you out.

238
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,767
10..

239
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,756
...9, 8..

240
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,357
- I can't let them burn it all down.

241
00:22:22,457 --> 00:22:24,326
- ...7..
- No, Peter.

242
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,761
- ...6..
- 6..

243
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:27,796
- Peter, they're gonna kill you. Don't go.

244
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,064
- ...5..
- ...5..

245
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:31,166
- I'm coming out. Stop.
- Don't, Peter.

246
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,367
- ...4..
- ...4..

247
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,736
- Don't go out there, please.
- Mom.

248
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:36,672
- Please trust me.
- ...3..

249
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,812
- I can take care of it.

250
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,642
- ...2..
- ...2..

251
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:42,742
[door opens]...

252
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,956
...  - What do you want?
- Come here.

253
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,570
- Oh. Oh, no.

254
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,192
- I swear,
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

255
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,292
- I said get over here.

256
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,950
- Oh, no.

257
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,697
Oh, no. Peter.

258
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,572
No.

259
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,979
- Fucking rat.

260
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,132
- No. Stop it.

261
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:39,232
Stop it.

262
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:42,037
- Like to talk, huh?
- Asshole.

263
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:43,839
- Stop it. Stop, please.

264
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,006
Stop it.

265
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:48,336
- Stay inside.
I'm not saying it again.

266
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,580
Come on, get up,
you piece of shit.

267
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,080
- Come on over here,
you little fucking..

268
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,305
[grunts]...

269
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:06,636
...    - Where is he?
- I don't know.

270
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,301
- Where is he, bitch?
- Where did you take him?

271
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,537
- I don't know. I swear.

272
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:18,173
- He's lying, Caleb.
- Fucking liar.

273
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:20,324
[beeping]...

274
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,414
...     Where is he?

275
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:27,731
Fuck him up, man.

276
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,411
[indistinct screaming]...

277
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:45,783
...    Motherfucker.

278
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:50,054
[screaming]...

279
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,575
...   [intense music]...

280
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:59,290
...   [siren wailing]...

281
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,160
...   - They found us.

282
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,736
- No.

283
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:24,882
Please.

284
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,118
Please.

285
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,824
No, don't.

286
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,398
No.

287
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,002
Stop. Don't.

288
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:48,305
Please. I'm pregnant.

289
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:57,081
- What?

290
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:02,037
No, no.
It's - - it's impossible. No.

291
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:05,027
- I'm sorry,
animals aren't enough.

292
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,512
- But we're sick.

293
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:12,612
- Maybe he isn't.

294
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,952
- I'm sorry.

295
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,052
It's too dangerous.

296
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,958
- It's too dangerous.
- No.

297
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,793
Please, stop it. No.

298
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,893
Martin, stop.

299
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,481
No. Stop.

300
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,908
No.

301
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:41,743
- Open the fucking door,
you sick fuck.

302
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:44,478
Open the door,
you motherfucker.

303
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,848
You fucking animals,
you killed my sister.

304
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:49,084
Open the fucking door,
you assholes.

305
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:52,854
Goddamn door.
Goddamn fucking assholes.

306
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:56,758
Open the fucking door.
- Ana. Ana, Stop.

307
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:58,727
Please.

308
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,911
Ana, stop. Ana.

309
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,480
- There he is.
Get him, Billy.

310
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,040
[monitor beeping]...

311
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,828
...     [sighs]...

312
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:00,504
...   - Is this yours?

313
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,745
What did you do with the body?

314
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,647
Where did you hide him?

315
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,152
- He wasn't dead.

316
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,188
- Bullshit.

317
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,476
- I swear I'm telling the truth, sir.

318
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:23,956
That's why I helped him out.

319
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:28,532
- So where is he now?

320
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:34,004
- I don't know, sir.
I swear.

321
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,041
He left last night.

322
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:41,912
- By himself?

323
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,600
- Lieutenant.

324
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,668
- I'm busy here.

325
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:49,104
- I know. I'm sorry, sir.

326
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,499
We found your son's friend.

327
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,658
- Okay.

328
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,958
- He was still alive
when they brought him here.

329
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,798
And they severed his jugular
and he bled out.

330
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:19,167
Connor put his time of death
about 8 to 10 hours ago.

331
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:21,677
- Did you close route 15?

332
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,472
- Yeah.

333
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,607
The team says they're getting upset.

334
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:27,375
They wanna talk to the chief.

335
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:31,430
- The chief is in Black River,
I'm in charge now.

336
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,182
- But, lieutenant,
even if we set up road blocks...

337
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:35,817
...  we still have no idea
who we're looking for.

338
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,951
- Yeah, we do.

339
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:39,454
Caucasian male, 6 feet tall...

340
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:42,444
...30-35, brown hair with a beard.

341
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,742
Start looking for him.

342
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:47,793
- Yes, sir.

343
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,798
I need your assistance.

344
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:51,533
[cell phone vibrating]...

345
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,633
...     - De Luca.

346
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,740
Okay. Yeah, okay, I'm on my way.

347
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,481
- He had a heart attack.

348
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:10,251
Probably caused by thrombosis
due to the burns.

349
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:12,687
He's stable for now but, uh..

350
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,442
...his blood levels
dropped dangerously low.

351
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:19,060
He could have another thrombosis..

352
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,296
...or an embolism.

353
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:24,599
And this time,
it could be fatal.

354
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:29,037
- My son is gonna live
longer than you and me.

355
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,688
Understood?
- Yeah.

356
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,325
[instrumental music]...

357
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,356
...     [sobbing]...

358
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:23,874
...   [music continues]...

359
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,839
...     [honking]...

360
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,169
... - We have a conversation
to finish. Get in.

361
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:09,671
- I can't.

362
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:13,041
What about my bike and my things?

363
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:15,677
- Nobody's gonna steal your shit.

364
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:17,777
Get in the car.

365
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,734
Get in the car.

366
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:42,953
Come on.

367
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,461
[door creaking]...

368
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,865
... - I swear I've told you everything I know.

369
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,965
I'm not protecting him.

370
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:15,986
Please, sir.

371
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:21,158
What do you want?

372
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:38,426
- I wanna talk.

373
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:40,526
- Here?

374
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,251
- Get out of the car.

375
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,523
[rattling]...

376
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,801
...  [instrumental music]...

377
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:05,146
...Okay, cuff yourself to that.

378
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,914
- What for?

379
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:08,382
- Do it.

380
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:11,202
- I swear I won't run away, sir.

381
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,892
I'll tell you whatever you want.

382
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:24,114
- Come on.

383
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:44,051
I told you not to lie to me.

384
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:47,955
- I didn't lie. I swear
I was telling the truth.

385
00:36:48,055 --> 00:36:50,691
- You told me
you didn't know who he was.

386
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,860
I don't. He came by my house.

387
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,429
But I've never seen him before.

388
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:57,529
- Okay.

389
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:01,064
I'll give you one more shot.

390
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,372
Do you wanna know
how my son feels?

391
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,806
- Please, sir.

392
00:37:05,906 --> 00:37:08,743
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

393
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:10,843
I swear.

394
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:13,247
- You motherfucker.

395
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:16,299
- No. No. No.

396
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:19,803
[Peter screaming]...

397
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:46,596
...   [intense music]...

398
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,202
...     [groans]...

399
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,578
...     [gunshots]...

400
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,066
...- You thought you were gonna
get away, motherfucker?

401
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,166
[grunts]...

402
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:29,466
...     [groans]...

403
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:41,444
...    [door opens]...

404
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,813
...- What happened? Oh, my God.

405
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:01,248
What are you doing? I have
to take him to the hospital.

406
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:04,218
And look at him.
Let me go..

407
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,788
In 5 minutes he will be dead,
and I won't be able to help him.

408
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:11,074
So keep quiet and don't move.

409
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,546
[indistinct]...

410
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,694
...  - What are you doing?

411
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,422
You..

412
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:29,844
Oh, my God.

413
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,645
I need an ambulance.

414
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:34,115
My son has been in an accident.

415
00:40:34,215 --> 00:40:37,818
209, 05 Anderson Drive.

416
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:41,889
He's dying, please send
someone right away.

417
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:44,158
What are you doing?
Are you insane?

418
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:47,461
Leave my son alone.
I'm begging you.

419
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:50,097
Please, hurry up. Please.

420
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,197
Please, please.

421
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:57,238
Sweetie, hold on.
The ambulance is on it's --...

422
00:40:57,338 --> 00:40:59,840
...The ambulance is on it's way.

423
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,511
My love, sweetie, please.

424
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:05,611
- What happened to Ana?

425
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,932
Is he your son?

426
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,968
- Get out of my house.

427
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,738
Get out.

428
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,815
Hold on.

429
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:33,207
- I'm really sorry, Monica.
But I still don't understand.

430
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:35,109
How could this happen to him?

431
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:37,678
- He probably wasn't looking.

432
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:42,031
And when he lit the match,
the can exploded.

433
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:46,187
- Monica, Peter has burns
of different degrees...

434
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:48,889
...on different parts of his body.

435
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:52,226
Are you absolutely certain
this was an accident?

436
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:55,496
He's always been so reckless.

437
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,584
Alright. I'll come back later
to see how he's doing.

438
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,818
- Thank you.
- Okay.

439
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,926
[sobbing]...

440
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,014
...  - Is Peter Ana's son?

441
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,770
- What are you doing here again?

442
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,873
- She was my wife.

443
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,709
I need to know what happened.

444
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,464
If she was your wife,
then you should know..

445
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,503
...she was running away from you.

446
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,901
- What happened?

447
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:01,010
[instrumental music]...

448
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:30,216
...   - Good morning, Ana.

449
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:33,994
Would you like me to take him?

450
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:36,196
- Yes, please.

451
00:43:36,296 --> 00:43:40,886
Goodbye, my love. Don't worry,
she'll take care of you.

452
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:48,609
- Should I close the curtains?

453
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,312
- No, I'd like to watch the sunrise.

454
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:53,412
- Okay.

455
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,071
[music continues]...

456
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:28,047
...    - Nobody knew
what happened to her.

457
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:33,069
- Ana wasn't normal,
she -- she was sick.

458
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:37,240
- I know, but Peter..

459
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:41,244
...was born healthy.

460
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:43,793
He's not a danger to anyone.

461
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,101
- How do you know that?

462
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:49,285
- Because he's my son.

463
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,627
The only danger here, is you.

464
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:16,713
[breathing heavily]...

465
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:21,651
...    - Goddamn kid.

466
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,354

...   [siren wailing]...

471
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,994
...     [sighs]...

472
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,690
...   - I don't know how
you made it out alive...

473
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,358
...   or where the fuck you came from.

474
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:55,453
But your life is gonna end
in this fucking cell.

475
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,699
What you did to Caleb
is nothing compared...

476
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:02,624
...   to what I'm gonna do to your sorry ass.

477
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:05,604
You hear me,
you piece of shit?

478
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:10,010
- Send my regards to your son.

479
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,979
- Motherfucker.

480
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,130
I'll kill you right now.

481
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:23,573
[instrumental music]...

482
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,824
...  - Then what are you waiting for?

483
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:40,857
- Everything okay?

484
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:44,861
- Yeah.

485
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:47,714
Everything's fine.

486
00:47:47,814 --> 00:47:50,534
Friendly little chat,
that's all.

487
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:57,465
Quit breathing down my neck, Harris.

488
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:09,018
[birds chirping]...

489
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,430
...      - Mom.

490
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:27,003
Mom. Mom?

491
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,075
[monitor beeping]...

492
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:38,832
Sweetie, how are you feeling?

493
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:40,932
- Better.

494
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:43,003
- Morning, Monica.

495
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:46,039
- Hi, Sonia.
- Hi.

496
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:49,879
Looks like we're feeling
better today, Peter.

497
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:53,232
We're gonna change the bandages...

498
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:54,499
...on your arms, okay?

499
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,769
Can you lift your arm up a little for me?

500
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,869
That's good.

501
00:49:01,673 --> 00:49:04,674
[instrumental music]...

502
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,967
...Something's not right here.

503
00:49:14,067 --> 00:49:17,070
It's been less than 12 hours.

504
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,840
- No. No. Don't touch it,
it can get infected.

505
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,975
- It's okay, ma.

506
00:49:22,075 --> 00:49:24,011
It doesn't hurt anymore.

507
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:26,613
Doesn't hurt at all.

508
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,753
- Wait, let me help you.

509
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:33,369
[instrumental music]...

510
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,249
...   [music continues]...

511
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,943
...    - Oh, my God.

[instrumental music]...

513
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:50,304
...    Are you ready?

514
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,705
- No, not really.

515
00:49:51,805 --> 00:49:54,408
- Just bring
whatever you need right now...

516
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:57,444
...we can pick up the rest later.

517
00:49:57,544 --> 00:49:59,669
- We can't come back, ma.

518
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,848
We'll have to see about that.

519
00:50:01,948 --> 00:50:06,368
Hurry up, we can still make
the 11 o'clock bus, okay?

520
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,771
- Okay.

521
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:12,375
[monitor beeping]...

522
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:29,458
...   [dramatic music]...

523
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,948
...  - May I help you, sir?

524
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:37,951
Yes, what happened to the boy
who was in this bed?

525
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:40,887
Did he die?
- No, he was discharged.

526
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:42,222
- You, sure?
- Yes.

527
00:50:42,322 --> 00:50:43,390
He left this morning.

528
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,559
It was a miracle.

529
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:47,659
[dramatic music]...

530
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:02,058
...     - Come on.

531
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,894
What's happening?

532
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:11,667
[knocking]...

533
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:14,777
...  - Sorry. Thank you.

534
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:23,979
[siren wailing]...

535
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,736
...     - Fuck.
- Fuck.

536
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,123
Don't stop. Please.

537
00:51:50,223 --> 00:51:51,324
He's trying to kill us.

538
00:51:51,424 --> 00:51:53,634
Please don't stop the bus.

539
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:56,345
No.

540
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,616
[dramatic music]...

541
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:06,227
...   - Hey. I'm looking for two passengers.

542
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,760
[dramatic music]...

543
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:30,210
... How did you heal so fast?

544
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,689
What did they do to you?

545
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:40,014
I just wanna help my son.

546
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:45,361
Please. Just tell me.

547
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:52,299
Please, or he's going to die.

Stop.

554
00:53:26,186 --> 00:53:28,255
- Stop.
- Tell me what you did?

555
00:53:28,355 --> 00:53:29,723
Or I'll kill him right here.

556
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:31,358
- No. Don't tell him anything.
- You, shut the fuck up.

557
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,498
- You'll kill us anyway.

558
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:36,745

559
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,796

00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:41,951
- No, ma. No.

561
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:45,813
- Swear you'll let us go.

00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,626
- You have my word.

563
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,330
- We should take
the sample at the hospital.

564
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,425
- No, we can't let him out,
we gotta do it here.

565
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:26,646
- Lieutenant,
you can't take a blood sample...

566
00:54:26,746 --> 00:54:28,048
...  without a court order.
You know that.

567
00:54:28,148 --> 00:54:30,817
- I told you to get off my back, Harris.

568
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:33,317
I'm sorry sir,
but I'm may have to call...

...the chief on this one.

570
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:37,557
- You go over my head on this
and you have no idea...

571
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:39,492
...what's in the store for you.

572
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:41,592
Understood?

573
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:45,298
Alright, boys, go ahead.

Please, don't -- Please, don't.

585
00:55:33,046 --> 00:55:39,719
You have no idea of what you're doing.

586
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:44,154
This is extremely contagious.
Please, don't do this.

588

he's been acting...

608
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,265
...really weird lately.

609
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:15,682
I understand his kid's hurt and all...

610
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:19,862

a jerk to everyone.

Where you think you're going?

that did this to me.

...- Close all the access roads too, okay?

663
01:02:17,183 --> 01:02:18,885
Nobody can get through.

664
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,720
Yeah, I -- I just talked to Black River.

665
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,607
They said they're gonna --
- Where's the stranger?

666
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:25,992
- Uh, let me call you right back.

667
01:02:26,092 --> 01:02:29,492
Um, he can't have
any visitors right now.

668

Listen, I understand
what you're going through..

669
01:02:35,568 --> 01:02:37,804
...but it's probably best
if you just go home, okay?

670
01:02:37,904 --> 01:02:40,840
- You have to let him go,
please.

671
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,175
- Sorry, I can't do that.

672
01:02:42,275 --> 01:02:45,144
- Please. He's the only one
who can help my mom.

You have to let him go. Now.

- Sorry about your mom, kid.

675
01:02:50,316 --> 01:02:51,784
There's nothing you can do
to help her now.

676
01:02:51,884 --> 01:02:54,264
- He can. Let him go please.

677
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,173

- Calm down, please.
Calm down, calm down.

684
01:03:09,468 --> 01:03:11,003
Think about what you're doing,
this is stupid.

685

695
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,558
Please, you have to save her.

696
01:04:05,658 --> 01:04:07,658

01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:12,026
Sorry kid,
I can't heal the..

698
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:20,498
Where is the infected one?

699
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,826
I need to find him.
Where is he?

700
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,530
Where is he?

701
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:34,487

- Just a minute, sir.
I'll be right out.

704
01:04:41,193 --> 01:04:43,029
Go around back.
I'll distract them out front.

705
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,931
- Okay, De Luca,
you stop playing around...

706
01:04:45,031 --> 01:04:48,346
...  and open this damn door right now.

707
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:52,376
- Get out of here.
Go out the back.

708

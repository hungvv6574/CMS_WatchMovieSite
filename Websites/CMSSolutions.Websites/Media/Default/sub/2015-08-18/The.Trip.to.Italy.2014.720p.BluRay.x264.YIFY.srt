we'll deal with it

- The only time
I'd ever snuggle up to you

52
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:26,273
is if I was on the side
of the Eiger, on a shelf,

53
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:28,272
and not to do so
would mean I'd freeze to death.

I've also sorted out the music,
the iPod.

a broad selection,

00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,091
a lot of Italian stuff,

65
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:52,088
a lot of, um, opera, obviously.

66
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,509

- Don Giovanni.

Rigoletto...

68
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,509
- Uh, Verdi.

00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,975
Then a smattering of Wales
and the Welsh

70
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:00,810
to tie in
with the beautiful countryside.

71
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:03,102
- Right, Verdi's sounding
very, very appealing

72
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:04,727
right now, I have to say.

73
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,774

and some Tom-

75
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,323
- We're not gonna be doing
any impersonations, are we?

76
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,988
Because we talked about that.
- No.

77
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,319
If I sing along,
that's not an impersonation.

78
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,323
It just so happens
I bear an uncanny resemblance,

79
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,575
vocally and physically, to Tom.

80
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,577
- What?
'Cause you look 75?

81
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,162
- Why is this-

82
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,164
[dissonant chord plays] Ohh!

83
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,667
- I promise you I haven't
sabotaged the sound system

84
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:34,004

to your karaoke inclination.

85

- I've not drunk
for about nine months.

98
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:05,753

at all on the trip?

99
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:06,787
Wow.

103

with respect-know anything
about food, really.

105
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:21,848
- I know a little bit
about food.

106

- Well, yeah, but you don't-

107
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,439
- But when I wrote
the last ones,

108
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,227
I concentrated
not so much on the food.

109
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,395
It was more a journey.
It was the culture.

110
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:30,983
It was-it was Wordsworth
and Coleridge.

111
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,897
Now ifs gonna be Byron
and Shelley.

112
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,069

something for a second time.

You know, ifs like
second album syndrome, isn't it?

114

Everyone has this amazing,
expressive first album,

00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,372
where they
put everything into it,

116
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:43,240
and the second album's
a bit of a damp squib.

Ifs like trying to do a sequel,
isn't it?

118

139
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,662
You know, Childe Harold made him

140
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:24,073
the most popular poet
in all of Europe,

141
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,621
and when he wrote that, he did
the first two cantos, right?

142
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:29,245
And he said, "if this is a hit,
I'll write more."

If ifs not a hit,
I won't do any more."

you won't do any more

It's not a romantic name.

00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:39,949
[laughs] He does my head in.

177
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,236
So Childe Stephen-
we'll do it as an article,

178
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,116
turn it into a Sunday night
serial on BBC One.

179
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:48,699
Who plays you?

180
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,915
- A Sunday night costume drama
about my life?

181
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,036
- Yeah.
Who plays you?

182
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,037
- It could happen.

183
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,496
- Who plays you?

184
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,998
- Play myself.

185
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,546
- You couldn't do that-
It's "childe."

186
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,338
It's meant to be
like a young marl.

187
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:00,838
You could have Jude Law.

188
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,339
- Jude Law's 40-plus.

189
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,673
- He doesn't look it, does he?

190
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,846
He hasn't aged like you and I.

191
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:06,926
- Well, he's balding.

192
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,554
- Yeah, but he's got that face,
he does.

193
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:10,681
- He's got that really young
bald look.

194
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:12,478
[indistinct conversations]

195
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,483
- When you played
Alan Partridge-

196
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:19,647
you know,
when he was popular-

197
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,107
you-he was more known
than you.

198
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,697
And, of course,
he was older than you.

199
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:25,319
<i>But with me,
with The Rob Brydon Show,</i>

200
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,492
my name is in the title.

201
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:28,489
I sort of push that.
- Yeah.

202
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,115
- If I were in a bar in a hotel
in Britain, right,

203
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,707
and I wanted to have a drink
with a girl,

204
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,077
I couldn't do it,
'cause there would be

205
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,580
an assumption-
"Oh, what's he doing?"

206
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,121
- Go and chat to Rob Brydon?
- Yeah.

207
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,122
People think I'm affable.

208
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,123
Affable.
That's what I-

209
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,334
- Well, you are.
- I'm affable. I'm affable.

210
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,086
- I'm not disagreeing with you.
- I'm an affable man.

211
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,384
- I'm not disagreeing with you.

212
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:44,964
- But my public persona

213
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,386
is even more affable
than I actually am.

214
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:49,385
I'm not as affable
as people think I am.

215
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,229
- You've made an affable rod
for your own back.

216
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,346
- Yes.

217
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,896
Yes, and I'm not saying
I'm not affable.

218
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:56,392
I am affable.

219
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,393
- We're agreed there.

220
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,019
- But I'm not as affable

221
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,442
as perhaps I've given people
cause to think.

222
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:01,730
- Crystal clear.

223
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,442
- So out here,
I can be off the leash.

224
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,319
I can-I can let my hair-

225
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,492
what is left of it-
down.

226
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:09,697
- Yeah.

227
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,199
- And, you know,
have a good time.

- <i>Grazia.</i>

237
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,433
You know, there's a publisher
who is very interested

238
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:34,268
in putting these articles
into a book,

239
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:35,472
a Christmas stocking book.

240
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,724
- How do they think
they're gonna

241
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,318
get six articles
and turn it into a book?

242
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:40,936
- Well, we would also do
the ones from the Lake District,

243
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,401
from the English ones.

244
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:43,610
What did you think of them?

245
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:46,071
- I didn't read them.
I was in America, acting.

246
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,866
- They were
a lightly fictionalized account

247
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:52,656
of your adventures
in the north of England.

248
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,578
- How were they
lightly fictionalized?

249
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:55,998
- The names were changed to-

250
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,703
- What about my name?

251
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,455
- We kept your name, but
the girls' names were changed.

252
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,129
- So how do they know
ifs fictionalized if it says

253
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,420
"Steve Coogan's Adventures
in the Lake District"?

254
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,546
Did you say,
"[Penned by Rob Brydonl"?

255
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:06,712
No?

256
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,922
- Not in the traditional sense.
No, no.

257
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,766
But then I did do the work
for you, didn't I?

258
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,347
<i>- Mmm.</i>

00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,724
<i>Bellissimo.

on the mini, then?

261
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,726
You enjoying it?

262
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,229
- L'm_ I'm pleasantly surprised.

263
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,437
- Ifs a nice car.

264
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,439
And to drive it in Italy...

265
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,441
Yeah?

266
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,031
- What?
- You see what I'm getting at.

267
00:09:29,032 --> 00:09:31,445
- Yeah, The Italian Job.
- Exactly, yeah.

268
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,446
- I was wondering
whether you'd actually

269
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,492
booked the mini in Italy...

270
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:34,491
- Well...

271
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:35,579
<i>- The Italian Job,</i>

272
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,493
just to give you
the opportunity to say...

273
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,246
[as Michael Caine]
"You're only supposed to

274
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:40,746
blow the bloody doors off!"

275
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,206
But I've done it now,

276
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,505
so hopefully
thafll be an end to it.

277
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:47,669
- Do your Michael Caine.

278
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,297
Did you see him
in The Dark Knight Rises?

279
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,718
[as Michael Caine] And his voice

280
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:53,305
gets even more emotional

281
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:55,097
than ifs ever done in the past
before.

282
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,847
I don't want to bury you,
Batman.

283
00:09:56,848 --> 00:10:00,224
I will not put you
into the ground in a little box.

284
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,646
I will not do it, Master Bruce.
I will not do it.

285
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,897
- [as Michael Caine] I'm not
gonna bury another Batman.

286
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:05,897
- Another Batman?

287
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,114
How many Batmans
has he been burying?

288
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:08,190
How many are there?

289
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,738
[as Michael Caine]
I've buried 14 Batmen so far.

290
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:10,901
- I've buried 14 Batmen.

291
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,404
- Their little pointy ears
into the box.

292
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:15,828
- I'm not gonna bury another
nylon cloak with pointy ears

293
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:18,408
that people wear
at birthday parties.

294
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,249
- With the little belt-
the very wide belt

295
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,998
that is flattering
to a man with an expanded girth.

296
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,590
I won't do that to you,
Master Bruce.

297
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,208
I will not do it to you.

298
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,877
- And I won't make the voice
like that.

299
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,347
- [wavering voice] The voice
goes even more like that.

300
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:33,090
He's basically yodeling.

301
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,135
[both yodeling]
- Yodel-ay-he-hoo!

302
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,807
- [normal voice]
And then Christian Bale says...

303
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:39,397
[as Christian Bale]
"You wanted to see me."

304
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:41,016
And when he says that like this,

305
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,016
he puts his tongue up in front.

306
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,563
"I don't want to be a madman.

307
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:46,562
I don't want to be
a normal guy."

308
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,771
- You sound deaf.

309
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,773
- [speaking indistinctly]

310
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,650
[normal voice] It's so nobody
can recognize him.

311
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,903
[as Michael Caine]
I can't understand

312
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:54,366
a word you're saying,
Master Bruce.

313
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,363
Talk to me as Master Bruce,
not as Batman.

314
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,579
- Why-why does he-
- [speaking indistinctly]

315
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,452
So he can have
the cloak of anonymity.

316
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,077
- But he doesn't sound-
you said,

317
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,999
"Here's that bloke in the cloak
with the-

318
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,624
who sounds
like he's deaf again,"

319
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,043
that is not anonymous, is it?

320
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:08,834
- [muffled voice] I'm deaf hero.

321
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,586
- No wonder when Batman arrives
and starts speaking like that,

322
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,134
everyone starts
looking at their shoes.

323
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:13,505
'Cause they're all thinking,

324
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,928
"Oh, God,
why does he talk like that?

00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:16,508

You know?

326
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,344
- And what about Tom Hardy

00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,059
Did you catch a single word?

328
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,681
- They're, like, competing

329
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,142
to see who's the most-
the least understandable.

330
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,360
- [as Bale] Bane, you're never
gonna beat me.

331
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:27,569
You'll never beat me.

332
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,189
- [wheezing,
speaking indistinctly]

333
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,316
[inhales sharply, burps]

334
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,234
[speaking indistinctly] Wind.

335
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,736
- [normal voice]
Take off your mask, love.

336
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,989
I can't catch a word
you're saying.

337
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,113
- Oh!

338
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,366
[muffled voice]
I was saying-

339
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,283
[speaking indistinctly]

340
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,035
- He's a wonderful actor.
Don't get me wrong.

341
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,119
- No, he's very good.

342
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,212
- Tom Hardy's
very, very muscular,

343
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:46,418
so he's a terrific actor.

344
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,959
- No, he's a bit-he's good.

345
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,176
He's scary good, scarily good.
- But...

346
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:54,046
[speaking indistinctly]

347
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,298
- I don't-I don't-

348
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,013
I don't-do you know
what I think that is?

349
00:11:58,014 --> 00:12:01,388
I think that they both
are very formidable actors...

350
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,185
- Yes.
- Very charismatic...

351
00:12:03,186 --> 00:12:04,264
- Yes.

352
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,849
- A little bit scary.
- Yes.

353
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,476
- Can you imagine a first A.D.
going up to one of them,

354
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,228
going, "Um, the director thinks"

355
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,774
"he can't quite understand
what you're saying.

356
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:11,987
Do you want to try
a different voice?"

357
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:12,982
- [muffled] What did he say?

358
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,197
- "Do you want to try
a different voice?"

359
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:15,193
- Oh, certainly not.

360
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,568
- "The director's
just a little bit worried

361
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,412
that maybe people can't
understand what you're saying."

362
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:20,614
- [speaking indistinctly]

363
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,830
Stick your foot
up his fucking ass too.

364
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:24,873
- "Okay.
All right. All right.

365
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:27,246
"No, um,
Tom says he's quite happy

366
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,874
"with the voice he's got
at the moment,

367
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,749
and he's happy to go
with that."

368
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,751
- [as Bale] What are you doing?

369
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,345
I'm on a set filming a scene.

370
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:36,255
Is something wrong with you?

371
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,099
- "No, I'm just relaying what
the director said, Christian."

372
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,636
- Well, if he got something
to relay,

373
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:42,052
the fucking guy comes
and fucking tells me!

374
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,929
[muffled murmuring]
- "Yes, no, I understand."

375
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,603
- [as Bale]
Don't you worry about it, Tom.

376
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,224
Ifs fine.
[muffled murmuring]

377
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,398
- "Yeah.
They're both upset now.

378
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,019
Okay' u

379
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,771
- [as Bale] He can just say it
in front of me...

380
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,606
[speaking indistinctly]

381
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,692
- "Is this not something
we could fix in post?

382
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,115
Because I think you opened
a can of worms."

383
00:12:58,116 --> 00:12:59,700
- [speaking indistinctly]

384
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,198
- "I know. I know.
I'm on your side.

385
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,073
"I know.
I understand perfectly, Tom.

386
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,494
"And, Christian-no, you too.

387
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,081
Yes.
No, I understand."

388
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:08,078
- [muffled]
We're all in the same scene.

389
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,127
- 'That's what I told him.
I think he's-I think he-

390
00:13:10,128 --> 00:13:12,294
"Yeah. Shall I?
He says ifs fine.

391
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:13,837
Just-just go with the voices."

392
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:15,925
- Fucking halle-fucking-Iujah.
- "Yeah, okay."

393
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:17,422
- [speaking indistinctly]

394
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,927
[conversation in Italian]

395
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,855
- I like Tom Hardy.
I couldn't do what he does.

396
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,768
I couldn't do it.
Neither could you.

397
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:30,142
But then he couldn't do-
he couldn't do what I do.

398
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,190
When you're saying
something like,

399
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:32,602
"See in store for details"...

400
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,196
- No way he could do that.
- No, no, no.

401
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:36,356
[speaking indistinctly]

402
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,275
Sorry?
Where do I look for details?

403
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,903
- And what's the thing where
you have to talk really quickly,

404
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,194
with the disclaimer at the end?

405
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,615
- "Your home may be at risk
if you don't keep up

406
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:43,739
"repayments
on your loan taken out.

407
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,992
Terms and conditions may apply."

408
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:47,085
No projection.
If you project, you add time.

409
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:48,118
- Yeah.

410
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,786
- Now, Hardy-

411
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,999
[speaking indistinctly]

412
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,341
- You got through it.
- Well, yeah.

413
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:56,380
Look, I'm a pro.
I'm a pro.

414
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:57,378
I can't be any other way.

415
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,798
But your average family,

416
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,422
<i>in the middle</i>
of <i>Comnation Street-</i>

417
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,174
"'What the hell is that?"

418
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,258
They're throwing things.

419
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,681
They're throwing the remote
at the screen.

420
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:06,266
- Mm, yeah.
No, no, I'm with you.

421
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,809
- I can "Hardy" understand
what he's saying.

422
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,807
- Mm, I wouldn't say that
to his face, though.

423
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,559
- No, never.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

424
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,810
Never.

425
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,937
If I see him-
"Loved Batman.

426
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,939
"Some people said
they couldn't understand you.

427
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,692
They're just wrong."
- Yeah.

428
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,407
- [speaking Italian]

429
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,751
- Oh, wow, look at that.
- Yeah.

430
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:31,371
- [speaking Italian]

431
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,040
- <i>Grazia.</i>

432
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,837
- Grazia.
- [speaking Italian]

433
00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:38,254
<i>- Ah. Grazia.
- Grazia.</i>

434
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:39,970
Look at that.
Do you know what?

435
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:41,214
That's just...

436
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,889
- There's a lovely-
- Mmm!

437
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,009
- <i>Lovely...</i>

438
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,594
<i>Mmm...
- Game.</i>

439
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,518
- Mmm.
- We're both eating game.

440
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,098
<i>- Mmm.</i>

441
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,646
- Game's very good for you.

442
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:53,683
<i>- Mmm.</i>

443
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,852
- Because living in the wild,

444
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,900
ifs had lots of nutrition.

445
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:58,438
Ifs been eating wild-

446
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,157
It's been-this is-
- Been exercising.

447
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:02,484
- On the run, very fit,
exercise.

448
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,328
- So if you were to eat
Mo Farah...

449
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:05,362
- Yeah.

450
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,865
- It'd be fantastically
beneficial.

451
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,490
- Ifs the equivalent
of eating Mo Farah

452
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,959
if you were in a plane crash
with him.

453
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,618
- Yeah. Yeah.

454
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,996
If you were in a crash
with him...

455
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,996
- In the Andes.
- In the Andes...

456
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,375
- I'd eat him first-
if he was dead.

457
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,044
- What if
he was mortally wounded,

458
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,216
you know there was no chance
of him surviving,

459
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:25,635
and he'd lost all feeling
in his lower body?

460
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,592
Would you start to eat
those fantastic legs?

461
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,890
- No, 'cause that would be rude.

462
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:30,053
- Keep in the freshness-

463
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,852
No, no, there's no rudeness.
He's gonna die.

464
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:33,974
He's already paralyzed
from the waist down.

465
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,943
"Mo, Mo, you know you're not
gonna get up again."

466
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:37,477
- If you put a tent up
halfway along

467
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,229
and you distracted him
by chatting to him...

468
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,318
- Yeah.
- Possibly.

469
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:41,903
- About his glories
at the Olympics,

470
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:44,359
reliving those moments-
"You united the nation, Mo.

471
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,111
You were wonderful."
- Well, you know what?

472
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,580
Ifs a bit
of a silly conversation,

473
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:51,783
but if you-
but given a choice,

474
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,202
I'd rather eat Mo Farah's legs
than yours, and that's not-

475
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,954
- Well, there's gonna be
a lot more benefit in them.

476
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,548
I'd be the first to admit.

477
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:58,957
Only a fool would eat

478
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,128
my legs over Mo Farah's legs.

479
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,127
- Yeah.

480
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,344
I'm trying to think

481
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:04,296
who I'd eat your legs over.

482
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,089
- Um...

483
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,674
Stephen Hawking.

484
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,095
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

485
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:11,094
- Although I'd definitely
eat his brains first...

486
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,722
- Yeah.
- Before yours.

487
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,683
Well, that was just right.

488
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,185
- Shall I drive?

489
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,280
- You've had three glasses
of Barolo.

490
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:21,813
I haven't had any.

491
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,066
- All right,
but I am gonna drive

492
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,441
at some point on this trip.

493
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,902
- Perhaps.
To be discussed.

494
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,530
- I can drive in the mornings,

495
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:30,497
have a bottle at lunchtime,
and then...

496
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:32,073
[engine turns over]

497
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,576
Slump in the passenger seat
in the afternoon.

498
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,874
- What are you doing
in the boot?

499
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,497
- Just getting some music.

500
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,123
One CD.

501
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,291
- Sounds ominous.

502
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,709
Not Tom Jones, is it?

503
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,128
- Alanis Morissette.

504
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,254
- You're kidding me.

505
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,132
- Ifs, uh, Sally's.

506
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,717
[exhales sharply]

507
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,801
My wife.

508
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,928
- Ah, yeah.

509
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,805
[sighs]

510
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,806
[seat belt clicks]

511
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,017
- Shall, uh-shall we?

512
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,941
- <i>Uh...
Nah.</i>

513
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,779
[cell phone rings]

514
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,113
Hello?

515
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,703
- <i>Uh, hey, Dad.
It's Joe.</i>

516
00:17:13,704 --> 00:17:15,121
- Oh, hello.
How are you?

517
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:17,744
<i>- Uh, I'm okay.
Where are you?</i>

518
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,455
- I'm in Italy with Rob-
Rob Brydon.

519
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,082
<i>- Buongiomo!

it would have been deserted.

868
00:30:29,086 --> 00:30:30,161
- Yeah?

869
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,789
- Do you want to go back
to San Fruttuoso?

870
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,381
- Yes.
- It was lovely there.

871
00:30:33,382 --> 00:30:36,250
[opera music continues]

872
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,045
- [speaking Italian]

873
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,174
[seagulls squawking]

874
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,814
- Come and have a drink!

875
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,034
<i>'</i> Okay!

876
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,031
- <i>Mm.</i>

877
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,450
Yep.
I've still got it.

878
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,165
A bit shocked, aren't you?
- Not really.

879
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,380
I've always told you
that it was a possibility.

880
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:14,997
<i>'</i> [sighs]

881
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,751
- You know, you're an acquired
taste, but, you know...

882
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,350
Something quite about melancholy
about this place, isn't there?

883
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:28,052
Ifs like getting stranded
on a desert island.

884
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,179
- Yeah, only not as hot.

885
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,019
- "Desert" doesn't mean hot.

886
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,016
"Desert" just means
there's no people there.

887
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,065
There still can be water.
It just means "deserted."

888
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:37,438
- Yes, I know that.
I know that.

889
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,188
Don't you think
everything's melancholic

890
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,736
once you get to a certain age?

891
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:41,774
I do.

892
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,944
Garrison Keillor said,
'When you're under 40,

893
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,280
"seeming unhappy
makes you look interesting,

894
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,449
"but once you're 40 and beyond,

895
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,993
"you got to do
everything you can to smile.

896
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,745
Otherwise, you just look like
a grumpy old man."

897
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,456
- Morrissey.

898
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,835
Byron was famously gloomy.

899
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,051
- What will
people remember of us

900
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:05,172
in 200 years' time?

901
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,298
- <i>U.</i>

902
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,299
That's a big "if."

903
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,384
- If we are.

904
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,469
- Either of us are remembered.

905
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,846
I would say that ifs-

906
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,764
it would probably be me.

907
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,936
- What would they-
what would they most remember?

908
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:18,357
What would be celebrated
about you, do you think?

909
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,106
- Six BAFTAs.

910
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,817
- You've got five BAFTAs.

911
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,990
- Yeah, but I'll probably
get a lifetime achievement.

912
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:30,284
- True. Yeah, you will.
- More if I survive.

913
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:31,746
- You could have it
posthumously.

914
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:34,663
I like to think
if you did win it posthumously,

915
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:36,457
I'd be the one to accept it
on your behalf.

916
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:39,333
Unless, of course, if I was
the architect of your death,

917
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:42,211
in which case I'd still
like to receive it from my cell

918
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:43,669
via satellite link.

919
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,092
- Yeah.

920
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,466
- Thrilled to have this.

921
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:52,344
You know, I killed Steve
for the good of mankind.

922
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,263
Do I regret what I've done?

923
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,686
Not really,
because I think the world's-

924
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:57,433
- Lights out!
- Got to go. Good-

925
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,601
- Brydon!

926
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,227
Lights out, you nonce!

927
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,980
- Uh, yeah,
that's not what I'm in for,

928
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,571
but I accept it
as a general derogatory term.

929
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:07,568
- [deep voice]
Come on, Rob. Come to bed.

930
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,533
- [chuckling] All right, Melvin.

931
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:10,654
I'll be a minute.

932
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,406
Anyway, that's all from me.
- I want a cuddle.

933
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,748
- [laughing]
Yeah, ifs all right.

934
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:15,415
I'll give you a cuddle.
Please just wait.

935
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,828
Um, so anyway, on Steve's
behalf, thanks for this.

936
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,797
He would have loved it,
but, you know, he's gone-

937
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,332
- Come on.
- Yeah, all right.

938
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,880
- I'm horny!
- I want to go on the inside.

939
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:24,293
- [laughs]

940
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,137
- Of the bed, of the bed,
of the bed,

941
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:30,174
not the inside of the inmate-
the inside of the bed.

942
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,843
[engine humming]

943
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,097
- I better go and call Joe.

944
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,357
See you in a bit.

945
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,360
[sighs]

946
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,980
- So how did you end up here?

947
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,607
- Hmm.

948
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,526
My boyfriend had a boat.

949
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,444
We sailed together.

950
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,073
Then when we broke up,
I had to find work,

951
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,159
so I got a job on the crew.

952
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,377
- Must be fun.

953
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,830
- Sometimes.

954
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,583
- Do you have children?

955
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,918
- No.

956
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,379
I Wish I did.

957
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,672
Do you?

958
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,173
- Yeah.

959
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,385
I've got a daughter, Chloe.

960
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,636
She's three.

961
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,513
- [chuckles] Aww.

962
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,722
[chuckles]

963
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,771
She's gorgeous.

964
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,977
Do you miss her?

965
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,186
- Yeah.

966
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,188
Ifs been two days, so I'm...

967
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,565
- [laughs]

968
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,785
- I'm not pining, but...
[chuckles]

969
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,158
[as Hugh Grant] ls thy face

970
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,116
like thy mother's,
fair, my child?

971
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,534
Chloe:

972
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:43,414
sole daughter
of my house and heart.

973
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,258
When last I saw
thy young blue eyes,

974
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:48,043
they smiled, and then we parted.

975
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,795
- Is that your Hugh Grant
impression?

976
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,218
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.
Yes, yes.

977
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,798
- [laughs]

978
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,425
- I think that Steve's
absolutely right.

979
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,846
I do find it very difficult to-

980
00:34:55,847 --> 00:34:57,808
uh, gosh, crikey-
say a poem, uh,

981
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:59,430
unless
ifs somebody else's voice.

982
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,432
And Hugh
just happened to be passing,

983
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,642
you know, on-on the beach.

984
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,361
And he popped over for a blow...
- [laughs]

985
00:35:05,362 --> 00:35:09,023
- By-blow account
of what was going on.

986
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,399
- [chuckles]

987
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,610
- "Sorrow is knowledge.

988
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,445
'They who know the most

989
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:18,240
"must mourn the deepest
o'er the fatal truth.

990
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:22,496
The tree of knowledge
is not that of life."

991
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,379
[seagulls squawking]

992
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,274
- [exhales sharply]

993
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,069
Fuck.

994
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,867
Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck.

995
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,866
[birds chirping]

996
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,947
- You okay?

997
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,291
- Yes.
Fine.

998
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,369
- How was last night?

999
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,120
- Fine.

1000
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,667
- You want to elaborate?

1001
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,793
- I don't want to talk about it,

1002
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:11,007
and that's not the cue
for an ABBA song.

1003
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:12,547
- Well, I think
when most people say

1004
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:14,171
they don't want to talk
about it,

1005
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,766
it means it didn't go very well,
but with you,

1006
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:21,220
I'd infer that, uh, it-
it went pretty well.

1007
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,939
- Yeah.
Too well.

1008
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,525
Ifs not how I imagined
it would be.

1009
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:38,195
- I've never seen
so many deck chairs.

1010
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,911
- See, you got Shelley
upon his funeral pyre,

1011
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:42,705
Byron staring wistfully
into space.

1012
00:36:42,706 --> 00:36:43,909
That's Trelawney.

1013
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,786
He's the guy that
commissioned the boat, so...

1014
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,207
- Oh, that's a bit awkward.

1015
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,039
- Hence he's staring
at his feet.

1016
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,383
- They wouldn't sue
in those days,

1017
00:36:50,384 --> 00:36:52,292
not like they do now.

1018
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,669
- Have you been injured at work

1019
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,388
while composing romantic poetry
on a boat?

1020
00:36:55,389 --> 00:36:56,797
Call now!
- Yeah.

1021
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,799
- 0800-471-471.

1022
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,344
You could win up to £5,000.

1023
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,345
Like Mr. Shelley-

1024
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,722
- Guineas. Guineas.

1025
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,725
- You could win
up to 5,000 guineas,

1026
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,727
like Mr. Shelley
from the U.K.!

1027
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,774
They wouldn't have called it
the U.K.

1028
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:13,944
Like Mr. Shelley
from Great Britain!

1029
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,735
But this is a very idealized
version of everything.

1030
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,409
I mean, he wouldn't have
looked like that.

1031
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,623
He'd been bobbing around
for two weeks,

1032
00:37:21,624 --> 00:37:24,950
so he'd have been bloated
beyond belief.

1033
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,748
- Everything looks better
in a painting, doesn't it?

1034
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:30,590
- I sometimes think
that one day, I will be-

1035
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:32,833
and so will you-
on a slab.

1036
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:33,876
- YEP-

1037
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,092
- You'll have a little tag
round your toe,

1038
00:37:36,093 --> 00:37:38,759
and somebody will be there
embalming you.

1039
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,225
- Yep.
- Ever think that?

1040
00:37:40,226 --> 00:37:42,050
'Cause it is gonna happen.

1041
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,019
Unless you're lost at sea,
and we cannot find you,

1042
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,059
which is unlikely...

1043
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,096
- Oh, God.

1044
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,640
- You will one day
lie on a slab.

1045
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,725
- Ah!

1046
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,185
- You will. You will.

1047
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,775
Ifs better to accept it.

1048
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:54,398
You're gonna be on a slab.
- Yeah.

1049
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:56,070
- And then-
and you'll be naked.

1050
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:58,484
Then somebody else
will dress you.

1051
00:37:58,485 --> 00:37:59,902
- Yeah, but I'd do-

1052
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,653
- I would imagine, with you,
that will happen

1053
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,871
sometime before
you actually die,

1054
00:38:02,872 --> 00:38:04,034
somebody else dressing you.

1055
00:38:04,035 --> 00:38:05,409
I see you in your later years...

1056
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,409
- [laughs]

1057
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,661
- Having to be dressed.

1058
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:08,869
- I will.
- You will.

1059
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,041
- And I'll be dressed by
a very attractive young nurse.

1060
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:12,790
- Yeah, but you'll be able
to do nothing with her.

1061
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,211
You'll be able to do
absolutely nothing with her,

1062
00:38:14,212 --> 00:38:15,550
'cause only your mind-
you'll be like

1063
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:16,758
<i>The Diving Bell
and the Butterfly,</i>

1064
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:18,378
and your mind will still be
as active as it is now.

1065
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,222
- I'll still be able
to sort of clasp her hand

1066
00:38:20,223 --> 00:38:21,548
as she walks away.

1067
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,094
- No, there'll be no groping
at all,

1068
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,219
and that will absolutely
kill you from the inside,

1069
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,435
because she'll lean over you,
knowing,

1070
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:29,431
and she'll taunt you
with her breasts.

1071
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,183
And there'll be nothing
you can do.

1072
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,105
And I'd love to be there.
I would love to be there.

1073
00:38:33,106 --> 00:38:34,649
- I don't know what films
you've been watching.

1074
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,605
- Do you know what I do?
I read for Steve.

1075
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,028
"You heard what Rob Brydon
does for Steve?

1076
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:39,738
"Steve is more or less
a vegetable,

1077
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:41,235
but Rob goes every day
and reads."

1078
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,659
And the only reason I do it
is to be there,

1079
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,533
watching you unable to reach out
to your Filipino nurse,

1080
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,832
knowing how much
ifs hurting you.

1081
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,049
All right, just a quick one.

1082
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,836
Look at that hair.

George Michael
in the Careless Whisper video.

1084
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,263
- Why do we have to do this?

1085
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,763
- A picture is worth
1,000 words.

1086

[birds chirping]

1088
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,683
- The sign says
go the other way.

1089
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,229
- Yeah, but the sat nav said
go this way.

1090
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,319
- Well, I think the signs
were right,

1091
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,895
and I'm the navigator.

1092
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,939
[birds chirping]

1093
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,988
It would help if we got
over 40 miles an hour.

1094
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:22,693
- All right.

1095
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,446
See how I changed down, then?
- Yeah.

1096
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:25,866
I love the crunch sound

1097
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:28,282
that you made when you did it
as well.

1098
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,283

1099
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,501

1102
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,165
- Care to explain this?

1103
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,792
- [laughs]

1104
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,794
[as Dudley Moore] Oi, here.

1105
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,297
What are you doing
with Casanovds autobiography

1106
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,090
in your sandwich box?

1107
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,967
[normal voice]
It's just research. That's all.

1108
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,892
Just gonna plump up the articles
with a bit of, um-

1109
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:51,847
bit of culture, you know.

1110
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,849
The, um-
this is just extracts.

1111
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,184
The full thing is 800 pages.

1112
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,277
- How long was your book,

1113
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:58,604
your autobiography?

1114
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,107
- [sighs] I can't remember.

1115
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:01,857
300? ZOO-and-something?
300?

1116
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,073
- 200 of that has
got to have been padding.

1117
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:04,112
- There's not much padding.

1118
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:05,611
I'll be very honest with you.
Have you read it?

1119
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,782
- No, of course not.
No.

1120
00:40:06,783 --> 00:40:09,123
I mean, I've skimmed the index
in WHSmith's,

1121
00:40:09,124 --> 00:40:11,117
saved myself the £1.99.

1122
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,370
- Ah.

1123
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,747
- Ravioli.

1124
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,748
- I see.
- Pasta.

00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,749
<i>- Grazia mills.</i>

1126
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,170
You know we're not that far
from the hotel.

1127
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:21,545
You know that, don't you?
About 10 miles.

1128
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:22,753
- I know.

1129
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,129
- Because I checked a thing
called a map.

1130
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,006
Ifs what they used to use
in the olden days, Rob.

1131
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,633
- Fine,
so when we get to the hotel,

1132
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:28,842
we'll enjoy the hotel.

1133
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,843
- Yeah, I know.

1134
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,059
We could have been
eating there now.

1135
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,647
- This is good.
What's wrong with this?

1136
00:40:32,648 --> 00:40:33,852
- Nothing wrong with it.

1137
00:40:33,853 --> 00:40:35,145
- This is good ravioli.

"He feared nobody.

He was equally at home

- Tick, tick, tick.

1144

It meant pleasure,

- That's not me.
I've got a moral compass.

- Oh, yes,
you have a moral compass.

1151
00:41:06,051 --> 00:41:07,799

where it is.

How's it going?</i>

We're a bit-

Well, ifs all right.
We're a bit lost.

- Oh, dear.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1159
00:41:30,784 --> 00:41:32,200
I am just calling to remind you

1160

That's good.</i>

1162
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,245
- With Yolanda,
the photographer.

1163
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,964
- What, the same photographer
as last time?

1164
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,206
- <i>Yeah, um...</i>

1165

ls-is that okay?

1166
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,002
- Uh...
Well, who booked her?

1167
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,676
- I don't know.
I think it was The Observer.

1168
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:48,213
Is that a problem?

1169

<i>Because I could always
try and change it.</i>

1170
00:41:49,888 --> 00:41:53,051

No, no, that would be rude.

No, just-we'll-
I'm sure it'll be fine.

- Yeah.
- Oh.

1185
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,456
Is that gonna be awkward?

1186
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,416
- Be interesting.

1187
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,885
- How do you do it?

1188
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,298
- Just take your trousers off.

1189
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:30,672
- Serious question.

1190
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,017

socks optional.

how do you do it?

- Ifs reputation.

00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,513

I don't see any reason to not

use everything
you've got in your arsenal.

with you 'cause you're famous."

and young."

Look at that.

Isn't that beautiful?
- Yeah.

the Duke of Genoa suite

1206

00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,843
- Yeah?
- Yes.

00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,287
- We were gonna go to Naples

1554
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:48,204
'cause Shelley lived there,
Casanova,

1555
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:50,417
but he's put the kibosh
on that, so now-

1556
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:51,876
- I just wanted
a bit of glamour.

1557
00:54:51,877 --> 00:54:54,419
In my head, I thought
we'd get a bit of glamour,

1558
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,756
a bit of, you know, like, um,
<i>Dolce Vita,</i>

1559
00:54:56,757 --> 00:54:57,877
Anita Ekberg and Marcello-

1560
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,255
- Ooh, yeah,
in the Trevi Fountain.

1561
00:54:59,256 --> 00:55:00,468
- Um, what's his name?

1562
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:01,803
- Marcello Mastroianni.

1563
00:55:01,804 --> 00:55:03,257
- Marcello Mastroianni.

1564
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,725
- Very cross when I told him
I couldn't deliver Anita Ekberg.

1565
00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:06,971
He-he had
one of his fits then.

1566
00:55:06,972 --> 00:55:08,179
- Driving along in a TR3

1567
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,557
with a cigarette hanging out
the corner of his mouth-

1568
00:55:09,558 --> 00:55:11,182
<i>'Ciao, belle.'
- [laughs]</i>

1569
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,899
- Well, the cigarette
might fall out if you said that.

1570
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,894
- We were gonna go there,
but he doesn't want to.

1571
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,148
So instead, we're going
to the Amalfi Coast.

1572
00:55:17,149 --> 00:55:18,648
- Nice.
- Pompeii. Sicily.

1573
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:19,696
- On.
Why Sicily?

1574
00:55:19,697 --> 00:55:21,651
- Why Sicily?

1575
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:22,819
- Yeah.

1576
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,037
[as Al Pacino]
You're asking me why?

1577
00:55:24,038 --> 00:55:25,154
- She's asking you

1578
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,623
what ifs got to do
with Shelley and Byron.

1579
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:27,782
- To Sicily?

1580
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:29,075
Let me tell you.

1581
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,496
- "Nothing" is the answer.

1582
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:32,915
- [as Marlon Brando]
Sicily is the home

1583
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,038
<i>oi The Godfather.</i>

1584
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,081
- Of course.

1585
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,377
- We think of going to Sicily

1586
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:38,628
because ifs where
The Godfather began,

1587
00:55:38,629 --> 00:55:40,336
you know, in Corleone.

1588
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,629
I want to have a homage.

1589
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,303
- Sounds like you're deaf.
- A pilgrimage.

1590
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:45,341
- [muffled voice]
I love you very much.

1591
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,342
- [laughs]

1592
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,687
- He knows very well
I'm not doing a deaf person.

1593
00:55:48,688 --> 00:55:52,056
- I normally like
your impressions quite a lot.

1594
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,432
- [laughs]

1595
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,475
- That's not his voice.

1596
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,691
[as Marlon Brando]
It's more like that.

1597
00:55:55,692 --> 00:55:57,027
- I know that's not his voice
either.

1598
00:55:57,028 --> 00:55:58,440
Ifs a deaf person.
- Well, you show me the voice.

1599
00:55:58,441 --> 00:55:59,653
Show me the voice.
- I can't do the voice.

1600
00:55:59,654 --> 00:56:01,023
All I know is that
that's the deaf person.

1601
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,822
- Come on, you can do
Marlon Brando, can't you?

1602
00:56:02,823 --> 00:56:04,360
- Come on, Steve.
You can do it.

1603
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,783
- Let's have a Marlon-off.
- Come on.

1604
00:56:05,784 --> 00:56:06,993
Let's hear your Marlon.

1605
00:56:06,994 --> 00:56:09,407
Let's even things out now
with your Marlon.

1606
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,876
- You need to put bread
in your cheeks.

1607
00:56:10,877 --> 00:56:12,159
- Careful.
That's crusty bread.

1608
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,536
He finds
some of the crustier bread

1609
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,750
a little difficult these days.

1610
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:15,788
I cut it up for him.

1611
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:16,959
- Oh, you have to puree it
for him.

1612
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,423
- Yeah, I cut it up for him,
yeah, gonna be good.

1613
00:56:18,424 --> 00:56:19,509
- Okay.
- Oh, there you go.

1614
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,210
[laughter]

1615
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,628
Oh, now, there you have it.

1616
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,300
- [as Marlon Brando]
It's like going to the dentist.

1617
00:56:24,301 --> 00:56:25,299
- You what?
- What?

1618
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,469
- Its like going to the dentist.

1619
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,467
- Say again?

1620
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:28,931
- You wondered
where your tent is?

1621
00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:30,052
- [laughs]
- What?

1622
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,888
- Send reinforcements.

1623
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,599
We're going to
send reinforcements.

1624
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,813
We're going to advance.

1625
00:56:35,814 --> 00:56:37,435
- "Send three and four pence.

1626
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,436
We're going to a dance"?

1627
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,563
- Thank you very much.

1628
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,483
- [speaking Italian]

1629
00:56:42,484 --> 00:56:43,483
- [imitating mandolin]

1630
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:44,525
- Go on.

1631
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,527
- You do the-do it, Rob,
the background-

1632
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,154
- [as Marlon Brando]
The whole time, you know,

1633
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,873
I just bite my tongue, you know,

1634
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:52,950
and, hey,
don't call me Godfather.

1635
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,118
- [laughs]

1636
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,336
- What is it you're playing,
Steve?

1637
00:56:55,337 --> 00:56:56,831
- Mandolin.
- Mandolin.

1638
00:56:56,832 --> 00:56:57,997
Was it a miniature mandolin?

1639
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,874
Are they all that size?
Are they all that small?

1640
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,969
- They're very small, yeah.
Have you seen a mandolin?

1641
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,002
[mumbling]

1642
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,222
[imitating mandolin]

1643
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,134
- Service.

1644
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,350
- Shall we begin?
- Yes, I think we shall.

1645
00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:14,347
- Let's let the expectant mother
set us off.

1646
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,015
- [laughs] Okay.

1647
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:18,437
- And so she plunges the knife
into the John Dory.

1648
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:19,810
"Ouch," says the fish.

1649
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:20,858
- Oh, don't!
- And we're away!

1650
00:57:20,859 --> 00:57:22,021
- [laughs]

1651
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,147
- Fantastic.
- Mmm.

1652
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,398
- Mary Shelley, I think,

1653
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,694
was the most interesting
of all of them.

1654
00:57:25,695 --> 00:57:26,693
- I agree.

1655
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:28,908
- I <i>absolutely loved
Frankenstein.</i>

1656
00:57:28,909 --> 00:57:30,700
- She was more successful
than her husband.

1657
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:32,536
- She was.
She was way more successful.

1658
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:33,953
- Probably why Shelley had

1659
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:36,079
so many affairs
with so many women,

1660
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,705
probably just jealous of her.

1661
00:57:37,706 --> 00:57:40,294
- And he slept
with her stepsister Claire.

1662
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:42,586
- Mary and Shelley together-
they had five kids.

1663
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:45,550
Four of them were lost
before he drowned, though.

1664
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:46,921
That's why they left Rome,

1665
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,924
was because William had malaria.

1666
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,598
- Ugh,
it must have been horrific

1667
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,386
having kids in those days.

1668
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,602
- Yes, well, talking about
Frankenstein, of course,

1669
00:57:55,603 --> 00:57:58,062
brings to mind my dear friend
Sir Kenneth Branagh

1670
00:57:58,063 --> 00:58:00,902
<i>and his production</i>
of <i>Frankenstein</i> with <i>De Niro.</i>

1671
00:58:00,903 --> 00:58:03,062
[as De Niro]
I got a-

1672
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,731
I got a-I got a bolt
in my neck.

1673
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,196
Got to get a bolt...
- [laughs]

1674
00:58:07,197 --> 00:58:08,943
- Got to get the bolt
out of my neck.

1675
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,366
Got to get this bolt
out of my neck.

1676
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:11,779
- Good God.

1677
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,531
- He's got a big bolt
in his neck.

1678
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,616
Pop a cap in his crazy ass.

1679
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,243
I can't get it out.
- [laughs]

1680
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,120
- Bloody hell.
That's not-that's subtle.

1681
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,371
<i>- Loom.
You' re bursting.</i>

1682
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:21,998
- [as De Niro] Robert here
is trying to divert you

1683
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,499
from the fact that
he can't do Robert De Niro

1684
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,625
because he doesn't know
how to do it,

1685
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,168
speak through the nose
like that.

1686
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,420
You know,
you got to get that sound,

1687
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,219
talking through his nose
like that, you know?

1688
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,132
And the whole
facial gesture thing-

1689
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,553
that's-
that's all part of it, you know?

1690
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:33,768
- Yeah, that's a bit
more familiar.

1691
00:58:33,769 --> 00:58:35,305
- Talk like that, you know?

1692
00:58:35,306 --> 00:58:36,512
That's the way he talks.

1693
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,933
- Hey, Frank,
what you got in your neck?

1694
00:58:37,934 --> 00:58:39,148
You got something in your neck.

1695
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,975
Whats that thing
sticking out of your neck?

1696
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:42,601
- I got some goddamn bolts
in my goddamn fucking neck.

1697
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:43,772
You shut the fuck up,
or I'll rip your head off,

1698
00:58:43,773 --> 00:58:45,238
shit down
your goddamn fucking neck,

1699
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:47,857
you stupid bitch-sucking
motherfucking asshole.

1700
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,734
That's how he-
he speaks like that.

1701
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,027
[laughter]

1702
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,118
- It was like
watching the video.

1703
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:53,785
- I don't remember that
from Frankenstein.

1704
00:58:53,786 --> 00:58:55,406
- Was that on the extras?
- [laughs]

1705
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:58,617
- Oh, you have to buy
the box set to see that?

1706
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,622
[birds chirping]

1707
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,458
You know, Shelley wrote,

1708
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,053
"It could make one
fall in love with death,

1709
00:59:08,054 --> 00:59:10,880
to be buried
in so beautiful a place."

1710
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:13,257
And within a year, he was dead.

1711
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,681
- Well, be careful
what you wish for.

1712
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:18,179
- It is lovely, though.

1713
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,477
- There's Shelley.

1714
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,558
Wow.

1715
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,774
- "Nothing of him
that doth fade,

1716
00:59:24,775 --> 00:59:26,397
"but doth suffer a sea change

1717
00:59:26,398 --> 00:59:30,024
into something
rich and strange."

1718
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,244
Defying the physical, isn't it?
Transcendent.

1719
00:59:32,245 --> 00:59:33,277
- Yeah.

1720
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,404
- Here's Trelawney.

1721
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,658
- His poetry lives on
in a way that-

1722
00:59:37,659 --> 00:59:40,661
"- 'These are two friends
whose lives were undivided."

1723
00:59:40,662 --> 00:59:42,745
- Trelawney died aged 88.

1724
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:43,913
- [chuckles]

1725
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,334
- What-Shelley was what, 26?

1726
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:47,005
So that's 62 years
they were divided.

1727
00:59:47,006 --> 00:59:48,042
- [chuckles]

1728
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,011
- And he-
and he bought this plot

1729
00:59:50,012 --> 00:59:52,296
'cause he maintained the grave.

1730
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,719
And he bought the boat
that sank-

1731
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,132
that killed Shelley.

1732
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,884
So ifs a bit rich,
him burying himself next to him.

1733
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,636
He spent his whole life
dining out on the fact

1734
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,101
that he knew
Byron and Shelley-

1735
01:00:00,102 --> 01:00:02,187
and claimed to know Keats,
which he didn't.

1736
01:00:02,188 --> 01:00:03,604
[camera shutter clicks]

1737
01:00:03,605 --> 01:00:05,601
- Steve, look at the book.

1738
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,445
Good.
- Okay, now I'm looking away.

1739
01:00:07,446 --> 01:00:09,605
I'm thinking.
- Uh-huh.

1740
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,399
The light here is great.

1741
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,444
- My favorite film
is Roman Holiday.

1742
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,487
- Oh, yes.

1743
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:17,740
- Do you remember Gregory Peck?

1744
01:00:17,741 --> 01:00:18,864
- Of course.

1745
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,209
- He had his flat
in number 51 Via Margutta.

1746
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:22,284
- Yes.

1747
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,536
- This is Via Margutta.

1748
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:24,662
- Seriously?

1749
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,415
- Yeah. This is it.
- Wow.

1750
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:29,293
- And do you remember he took
her upstairs, and he said-

1751
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:30,793
No, she said
when she got up there-

1752
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:32,922
'cause it was so tiny,
and she's like,

1753
01:00:32,923 --> 01:00:34,588
"Is this the elevator?"

1754
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,881
- Yeah. Yeah.

1755
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,096
- I love Audrey Hepburn

1756
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:38,264
and Ingrid Bergman.

1757
01:00:38,265 --> 01:00:39,510
- Keats. Shelley.

1758
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:40,933
- Brilliant,
brilliant actresses.

1759
01:00:40,934 --> 01:00:42,888
<i>- La Dulce Vita.
- Si.</i>

1760
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,855
- Well, actually, most people
think La Dolce <i>Vita</i>

1761
01:00:44,856 --> 01:00:46,851
is about the glamour of Rome,
but ifs about the opposite.

1762
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,147
Ifs about...
- Yeah.

1763
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:49,315
- The emptiness of that life,

1764
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:50,401
the superficiality.

1765
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:51,489
- Yeah.
Vacuous people.

1766
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:52,565
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1767
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,067
- The term "paparazzi"

1768
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,861
<i>comes from the film Dolce Vita.</i>

1769
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:57,909
- That's where it came from?

1770
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:59,118
<i>- Oi course, 'm Roman Holiday,</i>

1771
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,242
Gregory Peck
plays the journalist,

1772
01:01:01,243 --> 01:01:04,085
and his photographer friend
is played by Eddie Albert.

1773
01:01:04,086 --> 01:01:06,787
- Yes, with his Zippo lighter.
- Yes.

1774
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,916
- Which is where the term
"Eddie Alberto" comes from.

1775
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:10,040
[laughter]

1776
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,591
[cell phone ringing, vibrating]

1777
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,178
- Hello?

1778
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,597
- <i>Rob?
It-it's Lucy.</i>

1779
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,225
- So tell me about-
are you still seeing that guy?

1780
01:01:26,226 --> 01:01:28,022
What's his name?
- Roberto.

1781
01:01:28,023 --> 01:01:29,185
- Roberto.

1782
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,395
Roberto Brydono.
I'm sorry.

1783
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,735
A horrible thought.
Go on.

1784
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:34,404
<i>- Hello?
- Can you-can you hear me?</i>

1785
01:01:34,405 --> 01:01:36,108
- Yeah.
How are you?

1786
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,236
<i>- Yeah, yeah, Pm good.</i>

1787
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,405
<i>Um...
We been missing you.</i>

1788
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,325
- Oh, Well, I-l, um-

1789
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,784
I've missed you too.

1790
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:46,911
[chuckles]

1791
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:48,245
- <i>Really?</i>

1792
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,788
- Yeah.

1793
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:53,042
- <i>I-I mean, I've been missing
Hugh Grant as well.</i>

1794
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,256
- Well, yes, of course.

1795
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:56,003
I mean, ifs a terrible loss.

1796
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,506
I think we'll all miss him.

1797
01:01:57,507 --> 01:01:59,131
[as Hugh Grant]
I'm sure that-that,

1798
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,635
were he here now, he-he would
apologize profusely,

1799
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,845
uh, for his, uh, absence.

1800
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:08,933
And I daresay, he-he would
delight at the prospect of-

1801
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:12,937
of dropping anchor,
uh, once again, in, um-

1802
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:16,941
in, uh-in Lucy, um, Cove,
if that's not too,

1803
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,276
uh, inopportune, uh, sort of.

1804
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,861
<i>Uh. Yeah.
- [chuckles]</i>

1805
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,079
- Oh, you laughed.
Thank God.

1806
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,368
- <i>It would be lovely to
see you again, if you wanted.</i>

1807
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:28,666
- Yes, it would, wouldn't it?

1808
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:30,287
Yes, um-yeah.

1809
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,539
How do we-how can we do that?

1810
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,708
<i>- Well, I don't know.</i>

1811
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,710
<i>Um... where are you?</i>

1812
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,128
- Uh, Rome.

1813
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,672
- <i>Ah, I see.</i>

1814
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,883
<i>Well, um, look,
shall I call you again?</i>

1815
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,098
<i>- Yeah.
- Would you mind?</i>

1816
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:45,219
<i>Is that a good idea?</i>

1817
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,813
- Absolutely, yes.
That would be good.

1818
01:02:46,814 --> 01:02:49,765
I'd accept the call, definitely.

1819
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,186
- It's nice to see you.
- It's nice to see you too.

1820
01:02:51,187 --> 01:02:52,401
- Yeah, yeah.
You look fantastic.

1821
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:53,811
- Thank you.

1822
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,438
There's something in your hair.

1823
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,110
<i>- Good.
Well, VII call you soon, than.</i>

1824
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:59,233
- All right, bye, Lucy.

1825
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,281
BYE. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1826
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:04,739
- [exhales heavily]

1827
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:11,248
So how did it go last night
with Yolanda?

1828
01:03:11,249 --> 01:03:13,122
- Good.
Mission accomplished.

1829
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:16,834
Everyone's happy at,
uh, Houston Ground Control.

1830
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:20,089
Small panic when I disappeared
round the dark side of moon.

1831
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,297
- Oh!

1832
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,007
- We lost communication.

1833
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:26,927
But both of us achieved
a very satisfactory splashdown,

1834
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,345
and, at which point,

1835
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:31,307
Houston broke into
a round of applause.

1836
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:35,185
When Vesuvius erupted,
it just went "bang!"

1837
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:38,731
And-a cacophonous bang.

1838
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,484
They would've seen
a plume of smoke, just-

1839
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:41,951
just "boom,"
right from back there.

1840
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:43,235
[mimics explosion]

1841
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,330
And a cloud
going up into the sky.

1842
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:47,948
30,000 Hiroshima bombs,
200 megatons-

1843
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,617
imagine that loud a sound.

1844
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:54,204
This whole city's preserved
in formaldehyde,

1845
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,956
like this artificial-

1846
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,458
that's why ifs so remarkable.

1847
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,632
Ifs like a photograph
of the past.

1848
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:02,296
- Ifs a sculpture of the past.

1849
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:04,261
- Well, you know,
a sculpture is an impression.

1850
01:04:04,262 --> 01:04:05,634
A photograph-that's reality.

1851
01:04:05,635 --> 01:04:08,010
- Yeah,
but a sculpture is 3-D.

1852
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,762
A photograph is 2-D.

1853
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,180
- Uh.... yeah.

1854
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,933
Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
Yeah. All right.

1855
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:14,558
Yeah,
these people just are caught

1856
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,148
frozen in their death throes.

1857
01:04:16,149 --> 01:04:17,566
- Look at his sandal.
- Wow.

1858
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:18,979
They're like yours.

1859
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,356
- They are, aren't they?
Yeah, they are.

1860
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,779
- It shows you
that even 2,000 years ago,

1861
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,823
there were people
with bad dress sense.

1862
01:04:23,824 --> 01:04:26,362
- For me, the big question is,

1863
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,990
how did he get in the box?

1864
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,127
Was he an illusionist?

1865
01:04:32,128 --> 01:04:36,205
Was he a sort of
David Blaine of his day?

1866
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,670
But it is incredible, 'cause,

1867
01:04:37,671 --> 01:04:39,586
look, he's gone in;
he's sealed it.

1868
01:04:39,587 --> 01:04:42,007
He's like that guy they found
in the holdall in the bath.

1869
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,217
Ifs a small man in a box.

1870
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,343
"Here I am.

1871
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,344
"Oh, my word.

1872
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:51,767
"How did I get in here?

1873
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:54,098
"I can see the volcano erupting,

1874
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:57,893
and I am petrified."

1875
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,191
- The thing is, he was real.

1876
01:04:59,192 --> 01:05:02,481
He was-
this is a real man who died.

1877
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:04,155
I wonder if anyone cried
for him.

1878
01:05:04,156 --> 01:05:06,235
I wonder if anyone who escaped

1879
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,654
loved him and cried about him.

1880
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,248
"- 'We didn't get on."

1881
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,086
"It seems like he's a little
oversensitive to me."

1882
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,296
I agree.

1883
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,298
"Are you knocking about
with him?"

1884
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,768
Yeah, we're just
traveling round Italy.

1885
01:05:30,769 --> 01:05:32,344
"On, my God.

1886
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,268
It must be a nightmare
for you."

1887
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:35,681
It really is.

1888
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:36,854
In many ways, I envy you.

1889
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:38,434
You're inside the box.

1890
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,856
I mean, at least for you,
ifs muffled.

1891
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:42,855
"Yeah, I'm just
picking up the odd word,

1892
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,069

01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,301
- How far is it?
- Five minutes.

2066
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,178
- Five minutes, okay.
Great.

2067
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,018
- Should really have asked him
for his I.D.

2068
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:51,935
I mean, we're trusting him,
basically,

2069
01:11:51,936 --> 01:11:54,773
on the strength of a polo shirt
with a logo on it.

2070
01:11:54,774 --> 01:11:55,986
- Seemed very nice, though.

2071
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,814
- I think this is-

2072
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,611
I think steps are better
than a slope.

2073
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:04,033
- A slope, I think, is better
for your leg muscles.

2074
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:09,199
- I'll try the slope.

2075
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,826
- See?
It's nice, isn't it?

2076
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:11,868
- Ifs smooth.

2077
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,246
Ifs just different.

2078
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,458
- The Camelia suite.

2079
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:19,756
- Right, okay.

2080
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,046
- <i>Pnego.</i>

2081
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:26,842
- [chuckling] Oh, wow.

2082
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:29,261
- Uh, I'll have this one.

2083
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:30,726
- This is a very nice room.

2084
01:12:30,727 --> 01:12:32,597
Please have a look outside
as well.

2085
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:33,599
- On, boy.

2086
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:35,684
- <i>Pnego.</i>

2087
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,028
This is the Greta Garbo suite.

2088
01:12:37,029 --> 01:12:38,353
- Greta Garbo?

2089
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,277
- Yeah.
She also stayed here.

2090
01:12:40,278 --> 01:12:41,523
- Wow.

2091
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:45,527
- Well,
you know what Byron said...

2092
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:47,863
<i>about Don Juan.</i>

2093
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:50,743
"Could anyone have written it
who has not lived?"

2094
01:12:50,744 --> 01:12:52,701
- <i>Hi.
Rob?</i>

2095
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,077
It's Donna.

2096
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,079
I've got some good news.

2097
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,455
You've got the part.

2098
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,457
- Seriously?

2099
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,379
- Yeah. Seriously.
They loved you.

2100
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,549
They loved your audition.

2101
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:05,297
- [laughs]

2102
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,507
Right.
Wow.

2103
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,885
- They want you in L.A.
week after next

2104
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,469
for a costume fitting.

2105
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,430
- And how long is the shoot?

2106
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:14,890
- Eight weeks!

2107
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:15,891
- Eight weeks?

2108
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,142
- <i>I know.</i>

2109
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,102
<i>It's great news, isn't it?</i>

2110
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,104
- God. Right.
Um...

2111
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:24,325
- The film starts filming
in three weeks.

2112
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:28,320
- I'm in the Greta Garbo room.

2113
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,529
- Are you?
- Yes.

2114
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,531
- Really?
- Yeah.

2115
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:33,909
- Oh, wow.

2116
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,243
- Look at that.

2117
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,330
- This is called
the terrace of infinity.

2118
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,332
John Huston filmed a scene here

2119
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,552
for <i>Beat</i> the <i>Devil</i>
with Humphrey Bogart.

2120
01:13:42,553 --> 01:13:44,127
They all stayed here:

2121
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:46,472
Bogart, Huston,
and Gina Lollobrigida.

2122
01:13:46,473 --> 01:13:47,839
- Wow.

2123
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,049
Gosh.

2124
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:50,467
- Incredible.

2125
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:52,264
- And now Rob Brydon
and Steve Coogan.

2126
01:13:52,265 --> 01:13:53,887
- Yeah, right.
Yeah, sure.

2127
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:55,731
- Well, thank you very much.
- Thank you to you.

2128
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:57,976
Enjoy your evening.
Thank you. Bye.

2129
01:13:57,977 --> 01:13:59,022
- [inhales sharply]

2130
01:13:59,023 --> 01:14:00,602
Whoa, God.

2131
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:01,686
- Wow.

2132
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,521
[exhales sharply]

2133
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,945
It'd be great to go back in time
to the 1950s.

2134
01:14:05,946 --> 01:14:07,525
- On, God.
- 195a-

2135
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,653
Go back in time
and just come up here

2136
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:11,488
with Gina Lollobrigida

2137
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:14,324
and just snog her.

2138
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:16,039
[indistinct conversations]

2139
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,708
This is as good as it gets.

2140
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:24,751
- Ahh.

2141
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:27,003
- Ifs a lovely little, uh...

2142
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:29,297
- Ooh.
Nice?

2143
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,641
You know what that is?
- Very nice.

2144
01:14:30,642 --> 01:14:32,226
- You know what it is?
- Sweet.

2145
01:14:32,227 --> 01:14:33,310
- Ifs a kumquat.

2146
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,519
[as Christopher Lee]
Come, come, Mr. Bond.

2147
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,688
You derive just as much pleasure
from saying...

2148
01:14:39,689 --> 01:14:42,727
both: "Kumquat" as I do.

2149
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:47,065
- Come, Quat,
ifs time for us to go.

2150
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,817
- Quat!
[laughs]

2151
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:49,985
- Quat, come!

2152
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,529
- Quat, come.
Come, Quat.

2153
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:54,406
- One of the most erotic
experiences in my life

2154
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:56,622
was seeing a quat come
right in front of my eyes.

2155
01:14:56,623 --> 01:14:58,660
- Oh, please.
For God's sakes.

2156
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,709
- God, you've not lived
till you've seen a quat come

2157
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:03,873
right in front of you
in a bar in Vietnam.

2158
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,542
- [exhales sharply]

2159
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:07,419
- Mmm.
My God!

2160
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,046
When that quat came-
ahh.

2161
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:13,216
[chuckles] Grazia.

2162
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,140
[conversation in Italian]

2163
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,099
<i>Bogart,</i> when he <i>made
Beat the Devil-</i>

2164
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,016
you won't know this-

2165
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,813
had an accident
during the filming.

2166
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:23,855
Did you know this?

2167
01:15:23,856 --> 01:15:24,900
- This is news to me.

2168
01:15:24,901 --> 01:15:26,771
[both laugh]

2169
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,773
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

2170
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,069
- I came as quick as I could.

2171
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:31,693
Humphrey Bogarfs
had an accident.

2172
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,909
No, he had a car crash,
and he knocked some teeth out.

2173
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:35,451
[as Bogart]
So when he was talking...

2174
01:15:35,452 --> 01:15:37,073
[speaking indistinctly]

2175
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,667
- [as Bogart] Of all the bars
in all the towns...

2176
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:39,993
- In all the world...

2177
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,209
- Of all the bars
in all the towns,

2178
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:42,250
you had to come into mine.

2179
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:43,955
- Kinda relaxed kinda guy.

2180
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,501
- Just relaxed.
You believe he's living it.

2181
01:15:45,502 --> 01:15:47,250
He's saying the words.
You don't believe he's acting.

2182
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:49,169
- I imagine his arms
are always at his side.

2183
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,170
"On, hey."

2184
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:51,588
He acts as though

2185
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,341
he knows something
nobody else knows, yeah?

2186
01:15:53,342 --> 01:15:54,429
- Yeah.
Oh, yes.

2187
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,970
- You know that?
- Yeah. No. Yeah.

2188
01:15:55,971 --> 01:15:58,014
- That's what I do.
No, sorry. I do the opposite.

2189
01:15:58,015 --> 01:16:00,811
I act like everybody else
knows something I don't know.

2190
01:16:00,812 --> 01:16:02,724
- Right-.

2191
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,142
- Mm.
That's me.

2192
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,732
[as Bogart]
Now, Humphrey Bogart.

2193
01:16:05,733 --> 01:16:06,853
- [as Bogart] Keep talking.

2194
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:07,979
- Yeah.
He couldn't talk.

2195
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,900
[speaking indistinctly]

2196
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,653
Nowadays,
you get an Oscar for that.

2197
01:16:13,654 --> 01:16:14,736
- Absolutely, yeah.

2198
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:15,862
- Okay, but in those days, no.

2199
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:17,322
So what do they do?

2200
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:18,700
Okay, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.

2201
01:16:18,701 --> 01:16:20,116
They had to dub him.

2202
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:21,201
Who dubbed him?

2203
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,704
Steve Coogan-two points-

2204
01:16:22,705 --> 01:16:25,997
who dubbed Humphrey Bogart
in <i>Beat</i> the <i>Devil?</i>

2205
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,082
- George Raft.

2206
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,124
<i>I</i>

2207
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,501
Peter Sellers.

2208
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,381
- Imagine Truman Capote
sitting here, can't you?

2209
01:16:32,382 --> 01:16:34,005
- Can you do him?

2210
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,346
- I could have a stab
at Philip Seymour Hoffman

2211
01:16:36,347 --> 01:16:37,719
or Toby Jones doing it,

2212
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,307
but I couldn't really, you know.

2213
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:41,012
I couldn't really-
no, not really.

2214
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,889
I think you either do it well
or don't bother.

2215
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,811
- Better not to try, then.
- Yeah, exactly.

2216
01:16:44,812 --> 01:16:46,652
Gore Vidal said
about Truman Capote

2217
01:16:46,653 --> 01:16:50,438
that he turned lying
into an art form...

2218
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,148
a minor art form.

2219
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:56,152
- [as Gore Vidal]
Yes, I also said of Truman

2220
01:16:56,153 --> 01:17:01,741
that dying, for him,
was a great career move.

2221
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:02,959
Oh.

2222
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,215
- But did he purse his lips
at the end and go like that?

2223
01:17:07,216 --> 01:17:09,541
- [laughs]
- "0hh."

2224
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,419
- Well, the thing
with Gore Vidal-

2225
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:15,343
Gore spoke as though he had
worked out the secret of life,

2226
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:17,090
and he also said,

2227
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:20,760
"It is not enough
for me to succeed.

2228
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:23,054
My friends must fail."

2229
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,139
- <i>Mm.</i>

2230
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,141
You know, Byron was a bit like
Gore Vidal because-

2231
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:27,267
- How so?

2232
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:29,896
- Because they were both
in exile in Italy.

2233
01:17:29,897 --> 01:17:31,187
- True.

2234
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,031
- Self-imposed exile,
cultural exile,

2235
01:17:33,032 --> 01:17:35,358
because they-because their-

2236
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,985
the way they thought and lived

2237
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,987
was totally at odds

2238
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,952
of their respective countries.

2239
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:41,990
You know what he said?

2240
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:43,411
When Byron came to Italy,
you know what he said?

2241
01:17:43,412 --> 01:17:45,457
He said, "I will not give way
to all the cant of Christendom."

2242
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:47,829
He said, "I have been cloyed
with applause"

2243
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,664
and sickened with abuse."

2244
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,332
. Well.

2245
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,337
One of those must ring bells
with present company.

2246
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:57,380
I refer to the abuse.

2247
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,554
- Yeah, I know, but I've been
cloyed with applause.

2248
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:00,758
- So have I.

2249
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,385
- Yeah, well, I've been-

2250
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,225
I've been cloyed
more than I've been abused.

2251
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:05,847
- [chuckling] And so have I.

2252
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:08,183
- Well, yeah.
Well, there you go.

2253
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:09,606
- All right,
so we're both happy.

2254
01:18:09,607 --> 01:18:10,945
- [sighs heavily]

2255
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,197
- Mind you, if you got to be
exiled anywhere,

2256
01:18:14,198 --> 01:18:15,732
I could be exiled here.

2257
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:18,828
I could see out my days here
quite happily.

2258
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,372
- Yeah, well,
you'd be able to finally,

2259
01:18:22,373 --> 01:18:25,491
you know, come out,
wouldn't you?

2260
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,160
- What a relief that would be.

2261
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,004
- Oh, it'd be such a weight
off your shoulders.

2262
01:18:29,005 --> 01:18:33,041
- Yeah, yeah,
finally say to people...

2263
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,670
"Happily living with Steve
in our villa

2264
01:18:35,671 --> 01:18:37,337
overlooking the coast."

2265
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,340
Finally, we can be ourselves.

2266
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,348
- Can you wiggle both eyebrows?

2267
01:18:45,349 --> 01:18:46,893
- Oh, of course I can.
Elementary.

2268
01:18:46,894 --> 01:18:48,765
- Go on.

2269
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:50,234
- Yeah, you looked at me
like I couldn't do it.

2270
01:18:50,235 --> 01:18:51,940
You looked me-
'cause I can do the same.

2271
01:18:51,941 --> 01:18:53,106
That's no great achievement-.

2272
01:18:53,107 --> 01:18:54,567
You either can or you can't.

2273
01:18:54,568 --> 01:18:56,406
- Can you wiggle your ears
independently?

2274
01:18:57,858 --> 01:18:58,905
- Let's see what you can do
first,

2275
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:00,568
and then I'll answer.

Well, that's a disappointment.
That really is.

I was looking forward
to telling you my news.

That's terrific news.

missing Sicily.

See you at breakfast.

This is good.

You can taste a good egg,
can't you?

- Yeah.

2395
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:18,326
What I've discovered
on this trip

2396
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,745
is that I can live very simply.

2397
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,293
I mean, I'm very happy
right now...

- Yes.

- With a simple breakfast,

2400
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:28,669
a simple view, nothing fancy.

2401
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,422
- And that's just wonderful.

2402
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,549
I don't think you can top it,
really, with anything.

2403
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,722
- Could put some brown sauce
on it.

2404
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:36,010
- That's true.

2405
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:39,514
Emma's organized a place
for us to stay on Capri.

2406
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:40,890
So I was gonna ask you,

2407
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:42,359
if you want,
you can come and stay...

2408
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,564
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2409
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:45,274
- Because then you still have

2410
01:23:45,275 --> 01:23:46,692
your six places to write about.

2411
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:48,773
- Great.

2412
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:50,613
Be a shame not to go to Sicily,
though.

2413
01:23:50,614 --> 01:23:53,236
I was looking forward to that
for obvious reasons.

2414
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:54,946
- Well, you don't have to-

2415
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,572
you don't have to be in Sicily
to do impressions.

2416
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,449
- [as Pacino] See the
coffee commercial he did?

2417
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,867
- No.

2418
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,085
- Pacino-he sits there,
and he says,

2419
01:24:01,086 --> 01:24:03,374
"You know, for me,
coffee is a way of life.

2420
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:06,376
"A Pacino script will always
have coffee marks on it.

2421
01:24:06,377 --> 01:24:08,376
That's how you know
ifs a Pacino script."

2422
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:09,841
And then he takes a sip
and goes-

2423
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:11,554
"[as Pacino]
'That's good coffee."

2424
01:24:11,555 --> 01:24:13,965
"And you go,
'That's Al Pacino?"

2425
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:15,675
And that's another reason
why I think,

2426
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:17,552
well, so I did Crunchy Nut
Cornflakes, you know?

2427
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:18,973
But he did coffee.
- [sighs]

2428
01:24:18,974 --> 01:24:21,269
- There's a lot of similarities.
- Yeah.

2429
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:23,975
- Two short, brooding,
intense actors,

2430
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:26,695
promoting products
they genuinely love.

2431
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:34,986
[cell phone ringing]

2432
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,445
- Hello?

2433
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:38,114
- <i>Hello. You all right?
- Yeah,</i> great.

2434
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,583
<i>- I've got Joe,
and we're just about</i>

2435
01:24:39,584 --> 01:24:40,995
<i>to get on a plane to Naples.</i>

2436
01:24:40,996 --> 01:24:42,245
- Okay.
How is he?

2437
01:24:42,246 --> 01:24:43,289
- <i>Good.
He's great.</i>

2438
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:45,251
<i>We're gonna get a cab
from the airport,</i>

2439
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:47,750
<i>and we'll go to
the Fontanelle catacombs, okay?</i>

2440
01:24:47,751 --> 01:24:49,750
- Why are we meeting
at a cemetery?

2441
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,168
- <i>Well,
it's on the edge of town,</i>

2442
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:53,467
<i>so it'll be easy, 'cause Naples
is crazy for the traffic,</i>

2443
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:54,927
<i>and I've always
wanted to see it.</i>

2444
01:24:54,928 --> 01:24:56,465
<i>It's in
one of my favorite films.</i>

2445
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,059
- All right, listen,
tell Joe I love him

2446
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,969
and we're gonna have
a great time.

2447
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,893
- <i>All right, brilliant.
I'll pass it on. See you soon.</i>

2448
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:02,980
- Thanks, love.
Okay, bye.

2449
01:25:02,981 --> 01:25:04,181
Right.
Let's see.

2450
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:05,558
Let me see.
Where are we?

2451
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:06,856
Okay, I know. I've got it.
I've got it.

2452
01:25:06,857 --> 01:25:10,187
Don't you-
you just concentrate on driving.

2453
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:13,032
- Paul <i>McCartney,
The Long and Winding Road,</i>

2454
01:25:13,033 --> 01:25:17,403
and he may well have been
talking about the Amalfi Coast.

2455
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,654
[horns honking]

2456
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,703
Right. Very close.
Very close.

2457
01:25:20,704 --> 01:25:22,326
We can almost touch it.

2458
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:25,748
Right.
Have a look at that now.

2459
01:25:25,749 --> 01:25:27,669
Tell me-is that where
we're meant to be?

2460
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:29,123
- Um...

2461
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:31,000
- That should be working
with us, not against us.

2462
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:32,423
- I'm trying
to make it go bigger.

2463
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,066
Ifs a bit like
being at one of your shows.

2464
01:25:46,067 --> 01:25:48,476
- Ah, a lot of people.

2465
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:49,644
- Ifs full.

2466
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:52,068
I'll give you that.

2467
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:55,191
Weird, isn't it,

2468
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:58,361
that Byron used to drink
out of a skull?

2469
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:00,196
- Ohh...

2470
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:01,405
- You all right?

2471
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,658
- Alas, poor Yorick.

2472
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:05,368
I knew him well.

2473
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:06,369
- That's a total misquote.

2474
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,872
Ifs, "Alas, poor Yorick.
I knew him, Horatio."

2475
01:26:07,873 --> 01:26:09,538
- Alas, poor Yorick.
I knew him well.

2476
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:11,540
- It's not, "I knew him well."
It's, "I knew him, Horatio."

2477
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:13,384
It's the most famous misquote
in the English language,

2478
01:26:13,385 --> 01:26:14,418
and you just did it.

2479
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:15,885
- Whats the actual quote?
- I'm a bit shocked.

2480
01:26:15,886 --> 01:26:17,256
- All right,
whats the actual quote, then?

2481
01:26:17,257 --> 01:26:18,673
- Alas, poor Yor-ala-
Alas, poor-

2482
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,017
- See, you don't know it
yourself.

2483
01:26:20,018 --> 01:26:21,092
- I do know it.

2484
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,561
Alas, poor Yorick.
Alas-

2485
01:26:22,562 --> 01:26:24,136
Alas, poor Yorick.

2486
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:26,265
- Well, who are you talking to,
me or the invisible man?

2487
01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:28,435
- I'll tell you.
I'm talking to him about you.

2488
01:26:28,436 --> 01:26:29,855
- Who am I?
- You're Yorick.

2489
01:26:29,856 --> 01:26:31,435
Alas, poor Yorick.

2490
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:35,272
I knew him, Horatio,
a man of infinite jest...

2491
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:36,440
- Thank you.

2492
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:38,109
- Of excellent fancy.

2493
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,694
- Thank you.

2494
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,696
- He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times.

2495
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:44,198
- That is true.

2496
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:47,910
- Where be your gibes now,
your gambols,

2497
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:50,663
your songs,
your flights of merriment

2498
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:53,133
wont to set a table on a roar'?

2499
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,127
[chuckles]

2500
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,345
Puff.

2501
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,144
- [as Clint Eastwood]
Feel lucky, punk?

2502
01:27:04,145 --> 01:27:05,720
- He didn't say that.

2503
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,311
- I deliberately got it wrong
to reel you in.

2504
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:10,477
- All right, go on.
What's the real quote?

2505
01:27:10,478 --> 01:27:12,569
- I know what you're thinking,
punk.

2506
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:15,563
You're thinking,
"Did he fire six shots

2507
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,356
or only five?"

2508
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:18,571
both: Tell you the truth,

2509
01:27:18,572 --> 01:27:20,365
I can't quite remember myself

2510
01:27:20,366 --> 01:27:22,236
in all this excitement.

2511
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,080
- [as Eastwood] Its a myth
that he whispers all the time.

2512
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:26,073
Sometimes
he just speaks normally,

2513
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,867
but his jaw is clenched.

2514
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:30,872
- If I wanted a lesson
in how Clint Eastwood spoke,

2515
01:27:30,873 --> 01:27:32,079
I'd talk to Clint Eastwood.

2516
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,080
[cell phone ringing]

2517
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:34,832
- Oh, shit.

2518
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,250
Hello?

2519
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:37,752
- <i>Hey.
Hey, we're here.</i>

2520
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:39,253
- Are you?
Oh, great.

2521
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,674
<i>- We're just at the entrance.</i>

2522
01:27:40,675 --> 01:27:42,381
- Right.
See you in a bit.

2523
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:43,382
- Is she here?

2524
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:44,425
- Yeah.

2525
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:45,426
- Have they arrived?

2526
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:46,635
- Yeah.

2527
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:47,720
[sighs]

2528
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,221
[imitates trumpet]

2529
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:53,976
[laughter]

2530
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:55,019
Come here, lad.

2531
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,187
Hey!

2532
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:57,401
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

2533
01:27:57,402 --> 01:27:58,898
- Ifs good to see you, buddy.

2534
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,367
- There he is, big boy.

2535
01:28:00,368 --> 01:28:02,359
- Yeah.
- Hello. All right?

2536
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,574
- Almost as tall as you...

2537
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:05,571
- I'll have to start
wearing me high heels soon.

2538
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:07,117
- So listen, I've arranged
for the mini people

2539
01:28:07,118 --> 01:28:08,581
to come and collect the car
from here,

2540
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:10,201
and then we can take the taxi
to the port.

2541
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:11,499
It'll be about ten minutes.

2542
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,828
I, in the meantime,

2543
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,205
am gonna have
a quick look around.

2544
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,081
- I'll come with you.
- Good.

2545
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:17,833
- Hey, mate, ifs just really
great to see you, honestly.

2546
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:18,926
- Yeah.
- How are you?

2547
01:28:18,927 --> 01:28:20,377
- I'm good, yeah.

2548
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:21,844
- How's Mamie?
- Oh, she's good, yeah.

2549
01:28:21,845 --> 01:28:23,008
Enjoying it
a lot more than I was.

2550
01:28:23,009 --> 01:28:24,007
- Yeah.

2551
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:25,466
- Why are we here?

2552
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:27,259
- Ingrid Bergman.

2553
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,636
- Which one is she?

2554
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:30,805
- [chuckling] She's not here.

2555
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:33,265
<i>But she was in Journey to Italy.</i>

2556
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:34,767
- Well, how do you feel
about your exams?

2557
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:36,477
- Oh, you know,
I hope they went fine.

2558
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,105
I'm just trying
not to worry about them.

2559
01:28:38,106 --> 01:28:39,193
Just gonna relax.

2560
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:41,482
- I'm sure they're fine.
I'm sure they're fine.

2561
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:43,030
You worked a damn sight harder
than I ever did.

2562
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:44,777
- First her husband goes off
to Capri

2563
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:46,280
to try and have an affair,

2564
01:28:46,281 --> 01:28:48,572
and her friend brings her here.

2565
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,075
Her friends come here
to try and pray for a baby.

2566
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,451
- Ugh.

2567
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,453
- Let's get out of here.

2568
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,669
Ifs, uh-ifs a bit
of a downer, to be honest.

2569
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:58,133
I'm not quite sure why, but...

2570
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,960
- Antonella?
Si.

2571
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,127
- [speaking Italian]

2572
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:03,175
- How are you?
- Thank you.

2573
01:29:03,176 --> 01:29:04,463
- Hello, hello.
Thank you.

2574
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,090
- Joe, do you want to go
and put your bag

2575
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:07,308
in the back of that taxi?

2576
01:29:07,309 --> 01:29:08,759
- Sure, yeah.

2577
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,977
- All right, love.
Thank you.

2578
01:29:09,978 --> 01:29:11,428
That's a nice hat.

2579
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:13,352
- Borsalino.

- Could stop a bullet, that.
- It does.

Look at that one there!
Look! He's following us!

2599
01:29:57,936 --> 01:29:59,398
- Quite scary.
- Like The Birds.

2604

2605

- He let the birds
peck 1'ippi Hedren?

2606
01:30:08,071 --> 01:30:09,114
- Yeah, I think so.

2607
01:30:09,115 --> 01:30:11,206
- He also named
all the individual birds.

2608
01:30:11,207 --> 01:30:12,239
- Yeah, well-

2609
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,455
- And when-they'd be having
a go at 1'ippi Hedren,

2610
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:15,576
and he would instruct them.

2611
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:16,702
So he'd go up to one.

2612
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:18,376
He'd say, "Gregory, peck."

2613

- Yes, that's the one.

2638
01:31:38,456 --> 01:31:40,165
- What happens at the end?

2639
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:41,707

with the producer

2640
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:43,082
and then dies in a car crash.

2641
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:44,707

and a part-time actor,

2723
01:34:46,186 --> 01:34:48,396
he took the role
and made it his own.

2724
01:34:48,397 --> 01:34:49,479
He went for the audition-

2725
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,976
I don't know if you know this-

2726
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:53,192
and "Cubby" Broccoli
and Saltzman auditioned him.

2727
01:34:53,193 --> 01:34:54,313
They thought he was good.

2728
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:55,402
He left the room.

2729
01:34:55,403 --> 01:34:56,943
As he walked away in the street,

2730
01:34:56,944 --> 01:34:59,193
they said he walked
like a panther.

2731
01:34:59,194 --> 01:35:01,117
Now, in reality,
that would be impractical.

2732
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:02,696
He'd be on all fours.

2733
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,032
He'd be soiling the furniture.

- No, he's got a northern-y-
you do him well.

He's got a northern sound.

01:35:27,642 --> 01:35:30,060
- Things could have turned out
very nasty.

2750
01:35:30,061 --> 01:35:32,356
- That's almost
a very butch Alan Bennett.

2751
01:35:32,357 --> 01:35:35,145
Things could have turned out
very nasty.

- Daniel Craig.

2755
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:42,449
- Ah!
- Definitely.

2756
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:43,867
- Our generation.
- Exactly.

2757
01:35:43,868 --> 01:35:45,864
- You and me.
- Yeah.

2758
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:48,825

that Roger Moore again.

2759

- The Roger Moore again.

- Yeah.
- Course you would.

2762
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:53,291
It must be nice
for you to hear-

- He's so well brought up,
isn't he?

properly done, yeah?

And when I say "properly done,"
I mean done properly.

2767
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:05,842
Right. Ready?
Here he goes.

[as Roger Moore]
Uh, my name is Roger Moore.

Now, I'm a lot older
than I used to be,

2770
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,226
so there's a degree-

2771
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:15,898
I'm still doing it, Steve.

2772
01:36:15,899 --> 01:36:18,316
Please don't interrupt
in front of your son.

2773

2774
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:20,691
Do him shouting.

when they're doing that.

2784
01:36:32,462 --> 01:36:33,917
- The name's Bond.
- Move!

2785
01:36:33,918 --> 01:36:35,127
Both: Move!
- Hold on.

2786
01:36:35,128 --> 01:36:38,093
I want both of you,
one eyebrow-one eyebrow up.

2787

Oh, good, good.

That's entry level.

- Ah, very good.
[gasps]

2790

or I can do that eyebrow.

- Oh, that is really impressive.

2792

with very little effort
at exactly the right time.

2794

with shrimps and zucchini.

Great cooking, huh?

2796
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:00,485
- Great.
- Look at that.

2797
01:37:00,486 --> 01:37:02,527

the paccheri with anchovies.

- Oh, that's lovely, that.
- Yeah.

2799

- For you, that's the linguine,

2800
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:08,864
same with the shrimps
and the raw egg cooking.

2801
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:09,865
For you...
- Yes?

2802

- That's the best plate.

2803
01:37:10,914 --> 01:37:12,159
- Best one?
Wow!

How is it?
- Fantastic. Beautiful.

to make.

- Oh?
- Really?

2810
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:24,921
- You're pregnant.
- No.

2811
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:26,548
I got a part in a film.

2812
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:27,801
- Well done.
That's great news.

2813
01:37:27,802 --> 01:37:28,925
- American film.

Good for you.

- Yeah.

2817
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:33,522
- A Michael Mann film?

2818
01:37:33,523 --> 01:37:34,556
- Yeah.

2819
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,142
- Rob, that is amazing.
Wow!

2820
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:38,190
- Want to do another one?

2821
01:37:38,191 --> 01:37:39,728
Oh. Thanks.

2822
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:41,231
- Gosh, that's incredible.

2823
01:37:41,232 --> 01:37:43,023
- I know,
and ifs one of the leads.

2824

That's amazing.
I can see it.

- Gangster accountant?
- Tough guy with a pen.

in the audition.

you gonna be away for'?

- Eight weeks?
Gosh.

- That's tough.

though, isn't it?

Plenty of time for all that.

01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:36,080
- [as Hugh Grant]
I have another announcement,

2922
01:40:36,081 --> 01:40:37,492
uh, to make, actually.

2923
01:40:37,493 --> 01:40:38,537
- Really?
- Yes.

2924
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:43,328
I've had a little adventure.

2925
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:44,412
- Right-.

2926
01:40:44,413 --> 01:40:45,789
- You know the boat
that we went on?

2927
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,374
- Yeah.

2928
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:50,961
- I had an...
altercation with a-

2929
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:52,754
a deckhand.

2930
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:53,800
- You had a fight?

2931
01:40:53,801 --> 01:40:55,549
- No, no, quite the opposite.

2932
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:58,093
A-a lady, uh, deckhand,

2933
01:40:58,094 --> 01:41:02,055
who-who-
who shivered my timber.

2934
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:06,476
She-she circumnavigated
my globe.

2935
01:41:06,477 --> 01:41:09,071
She-she scraped the barnacles
from my bottom.

2936
01:41:09,072 --> 01:41:10,272
- [laughs]

2937
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:12,613
- And she hoisted,
uh, my mainsail.

2938
01:41:12,614 --> 01:41:14,359
- I get the picture.
- Yes, yes.

2939
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:15,777
- [laughs]

2940
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:19,197
- And, of course, the-
the thing is...

2941
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:22,784
I'm thinking about
hopping aboard again

2942
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:24,911
before we return home.

2943
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:27,080
- Really?
- Yes. Yes.

2944
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:28,957
Slight fly in the ointment,
of course-

wife, small child back at home.

2946
01:41:30,677 --> 01:41:32,085
- Yeah.

2947
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,546
- I'm-certainly don't want you
to sit in judgment.

2948
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:35,547
- Oh, Rob, I wasn't.

2949
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:36,593
- Or to profess an opinion.

2950
01:41:36,594 --> 01:41:37,592
. OKQY-

2951
01:41:37,593 --> 01:41:38,684
- But what do you think?

2952
01:41:38,685 --> 01:41:39,884
- [laughs]

2953
01:41:39,885 --> 01:41:42,262
Oh, God.
Do you know what?

2954
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:45,604
Hormonal pregnant women
probably aren't the best to ask.

2955
01:41:45,605 --> 01:41:46,943
I don't know, really.

2956
01:41:46,944 --> 01:41:48,311
- Ah.

2957
01:41:53,608 --> 01:41:55,030
" Rob!"

2958
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:59,613
Rob, are you gonna come in?

2959
01:41:59,614 --> 01:42:00,822
- No, thank you!

2960
01:42:00,823 --> 01:42:02,824
- Go out for a swim?

2961
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,576
- No, thanks!

2962
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:06,578
- You're missing out!

2963
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:08,288
- I know!

2964
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:10,582

Oh, this is relaxing.

2967
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:18,051
- Remember
the end of Roman Holiday,

2968
01:42:18,052 --> 01:42:19,642
when Gregory Peck
and Audrey Hepburn

2969
01:42:19,643 --> 01:42:22,636
have that amazing day together,

2970
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:25,184
and then she goes back
to being a princess?

2971
01:42:25,185 --> 01:42:28,276
And she gets told about
her duties as a princess.

2972
01:42:28,277 --> 01:42:29,893
And she says,

2973
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:32,854
"if I wasn't aware
of the importance

2974
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:36,858
"of my duties to my family
and to my country,

2975
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:39,203
I wouldn't have ever come back."

01:42:53,711 --> 01:42:55,585
- So you can come over.

2985
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:58,802
You maybe could come
and live with me if you wanted.

2986
01:42:58,803 --> 01:43:00,215

2987

- Yeah.

2988
01:43:01,217 --> 01:43:03,426
- And I don't want
to not be with her.

Yes, that's my point.

1
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:30,335
<i>- Sí. Bueno.
-  Family is everything.</i>

2
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,237
<i>No?</i>

3
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:35,743
<i>Now, do you love your son?</i>

4
00:02:36,713 --> 00:02:40,479
Sí.

5
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:51,953
<i>Now... do you understand?</i>

6
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:56,430
<i>You have a $10 million insurance policy.
I know that.</i>

7
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:08,056
Georgina!

8
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:11,429
Obey me, I will love you.
Come on.

9
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:13,297
That's how it works, huh?

10
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:16,566
<i>- Simple.</i>
- That's right.

11
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:18,573
Mwah.

12
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:26,011
She got a sister?

13
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:29,312
How's business?

14
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,320
The Japanese are here in a big way.

15
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:36,247
Cheap labor, factory space.

16
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:40,318
But they feel a lot safer living
over the border in El Paso.

17
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,490
I ferry them back and forth.
They think I'm John Wayne.

18
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,500
- Ah.
- Come on.

19
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:53,204
- I live like a king down here.
- Yes, you do.

20
00:05:56,946 --> 00:06:00,109
- You been workin'?
- Yeah. No.

21
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:02,275
Nah. Been movin' around,
you know.

22
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:06,446
Colombia, couple of places I can't name.
Nothing catches my fancy.

23
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:11,293
Oh.

24
00:06:11,394 --> 00:06:13,954
You think God will forgive us
for what we've done?

25
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:16,623
- No.
- You don't?

26
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:20,897
Me either.

27
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:25,805
- How long you staying?
- I don't know. I just... you know.

28
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:29,867
I wanted to see you, Ray,
see how you're doin'.

29
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,504
You know, I came by on impulse.

30
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:36,176
Well, I could do with some impulse.

31
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:49,321
What happened?

32
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:51,627
Family paid the ransom...

33
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:55,727
then they sent the kid home
after a couple of days...

34
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:57,999
minus an ear, of course.

35
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:01,836
Now every mother in Mexico City with a little bit
of money wants bigger and better bodyguards...

36
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:03,812
my own wife included.

37
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:07,212
I hate to break it to you,
but she's right. She's right.

38
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,184
Look, Sammy, all my clients have, uh,
kidnap and ransom insurance.

39
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:16,520
I have a policy. A.I.G.
My dad gave it to me.

40
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:19,891
Yeah, I know.
I got it for your dad.

41
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:22,431
<i>But what are you gonna do in 60 days
when you can't renew it?</i>

42
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,384
You can't because you
don't have a bodyguard.

43
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,022
I know. I had to let Emilio go.

44
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:31,032
You gotta please Lisa.
I mean, hey, ass like that's hard to find.

45
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:37,742
Look, a bodyguard's like anything else.

46
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:41,112
You get what you pay for, okay?

47
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:44,209
You could do this.
You get one that's got a decent résumé.

48
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,652
We're not looking for
goddamn Superman here, right?

49
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,486
Get someone cheap
till you renew the policy...

50
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:52,959
and then, uh...
then fire the prick for whatever.

51
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:55,121
Incompetence.

52
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:59,634
All kidding aside, the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school...

53
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:02,705
and that your wife gets to save face.

54
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:07,606
This way, you won't be the only
unprotected family in the neighborhood.

55
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,420
<i>That's right. A bodyguard.
Your Spanish is good enough.</i>

56
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:26,927
- You're crazy.
- You even look the part.

57
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:29,497
In my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.

58
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,397
<i>It's rich guys flashing their cash.
It's all for show.</i>

59
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:33,633
Nothing's gonna happen.

60
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:35,858
<i>Yeah?
You think they'd hire a drunk, a has-been?</i>

61
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:42,607
You have to keep it under control.

62
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:47,479
What if there was, you know, say,
a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

63
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,610
<i>You do your best. They're not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles.</i>

64
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:54,315
- I don't know.
<i>- It's not exactly a scam, Crease.</i>

65
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:58,655
- Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.
- Yeah.

66
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:00,956
Bodyguard's gotta be close
to people though.

67
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:03,896
He gotta talk all the time,
and I'm no good at that.

68
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,527
You'll be the silent type.
People are gonna appreciate that.

69
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:17,344
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?

70
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:20,347
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.

71
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:23,247
<i>He owns one of the plants in Juárez.</i>

72
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:25,286
<i>Yeah?</i>

73
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:28,186
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.

74
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,226
He's trying to persuade Ford
to partner with him.

75
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:35,195
I think he's in trouble.
His family lives in Mexico City.

76
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,823
He asked me if I knew
anybody he could trust.

77
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:42,394
- And you thought of me.
- Yeah.

78
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:45,906
Take a job, Crease.
Breathe some air.

79
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:48,374
<i>Then decide if you want
to stick around or not.</i>

80
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:52,573
<i>Besides, I'm glad to see you.
I got nobody to talk to down here.</i>

81
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:02,957
Listen, my wife wants someone
presentable and polite.

82
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:08,855
You'll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week.

83
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:10,694
Your résumé's quite impressive.

84
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,260
<i>Sixteen years of military experience,
extensive counterterrorism work.</i>

85
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:18,932
I'm surprised anybody could afford you.
What's the catch?

86
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,305
I drink.

87
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,401
How does that affect you?

88
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:25,980
Well...

89
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:28,209
coordination, reaction time.

90
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:32,083
If top professionals try to kidnap
your daughter, I'll do the best I can...

91
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:35,214
but the service will be
on par with the pay.

92
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,384
What if amateurs tried?

93
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:41,622
I'd probably kill 'em.
Is that likely?

94
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,699
No.

95
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:46,563
No one is to know about your drinking.
That includes my wife.

96
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:16,226
Lisa!

97
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:20,334
Lisa!

98
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:34,448
My wife, Lisa.
And this is John Creasy.

99
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,720
- You're an American.
- So are you.

100
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:47,558
It's all in there.

101
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:52,533
Would you like a drink?

102
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:55,365
Yes, uh, Jack and
water'd be good.

103
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:59,166
Have you done much of
this kind of work before?

104
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:00,575
No, ma'am.

105
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:04,342
But he has a lot of
experience in related fields.

106
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:09,545
- You have a family, Mr. Creasy?
- No.

107
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:11,847
Pita.

108
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:13,922
<i>Pita.</i>

109
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:17,350
- Thank you.
- Yes, Mom?

110
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,360
Honey, this is, uh, Mr. Creasy.

111
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,001
In English, honey.

112
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:29,731
Um, do you wanna show
Mr. Creasy to his room?

113
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,536
- This way, Mr. Creasy.
- Okay.

114
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,950
Thank you.

115
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:53,691
Just like that?

116
00:12:53,796 --> 00:12:56,196
I think it's nice...

117
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:58,766
that he's an American.

118
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:03,066
I think it's terrific. You sure?

119
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,039
Thank you.

120
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:10,772
Thank you.

121
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,348
I feel better now.

122
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:18,152
<i>- ¡Hola, Bruno!
- ¡Buenas tardes!</i>

123
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:20,552
That's Bruno, the gardener.

124
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,715
And, um, that's Maria, the cook.

125
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:25,623
<i>- ¡Hola, Maria!
- Hola, Pita.</i>

126
00:13:27,897 --> 00:13:31,924
We fixed the room up two weeks ago.
It's nicer than before.

127
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:38,938
<i>You've got a TV and C.D. Player.
What kind of music do you like, Mr. Creasy?</i>

128
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,407
I don't know.

129
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,001
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

130
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:47,276
That's Bird.

131
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:50,250
Emilio forgot to take
him when he left.

132
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,752
Emilio was my last bodyguard.

133
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:59,990
Have you protected a lot of children
before, Mr. Creasy?

134
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:02,860
Creasy. You can call me Creasy.
And no, you're the first.

135
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:04,865
Creasy.

136
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:06,901
Bye, Creasy.

137
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:09,664
So long.

138
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:12,502
Bye, Bird.

139
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:19,511
Ow.

140
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:25,977
- School tomorrow, peeps.
- Does that mean we can get a dog?

141
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:29,857
<i>Dad promised me one
when I went back to school.</i>

142
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,654
Yeah, we'll see.

143
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,560
If you get a dog,
will you give up your bear?

144
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:38,997
You're getting too old for him.

145
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:42,502
- How'd you like Mr. Creasy?
<i>- Creasy.</i>

146
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,971
He said to call him just Creasy.

147
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:47,542
- Uh-huh.
- That isn't disrespectful, is it?

148
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:49,941
No, not if he asked you.

149
00:14:50,045 --> 00:14:52,878
Here. There you go.

150
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:04,523
- He's like a bear too.
- Yeah?

151
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:06,925
A big, sad bear.

152
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:12,193
- Is he sad?
- I think. Or something.

153
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:17,905
- Good night, honey.
- Night.

154
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,608
- Oh, can you get me some floss in the morning?
- Floss?

155
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:28,240
- Yeah, the strawberry kind.
- Oh, sure.

156
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:32,611
Good night, Bear.

157
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:35,690
Creasy Bear.

158
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:11,557
What's that one for?

159
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,560
<i>La Virgin de Guadalupe.</i>

160
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:18,065
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.

161
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:20,795
If one dies, maybe she can
resurrect the other one.

162
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:23,463
I don't know.

163
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:26,507
She likes him.

164
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,407
- What are you talking about?
- Creasy.

165
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:35,610
Pita likes him.

166
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:37,618
Pita loves school.

167
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,919
<i>Pita would love Count Dracula
if he took her back there, honey.</i>

168
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:44,993
Okay?

169
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:50,330
- Hey. Are you okay?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

170
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:54,528
Okay?

171
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:57,071
I don't know, Lisa.

172
00:16:57,172 --> 00:16:59,140
I'm trying.

173
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,298
Come on, Bird.

174
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:59,765
That's right.
That's right. Come on.

175
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:03,031
All right. Home to Emilio.

176
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:06,005
You're home free, baby.

177
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:28,892
- Where are you from, Creasy?
- The U.S.

178
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:31,932
<i>- I know, but which state?</i>
- No state in particular.

179
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:34,025
You can drive and talk at the same time.

180
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:36,604
No, I can't, Pita, so, please,
let me just do my job.

181
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:42,775
Are you going to stay?

182
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:44,778
My last bodyguard left.

183
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,747
Somebody gave him
more money than we could.

184
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,809
I guess that makes me
a bargain then, huh?

185
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,323
Being black... is that a positive or
negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?

186
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:58,325
Time will tell.

187
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:06,096
There were 24 kidnappings
in Mexico City in the last six days.

188
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:08,101
- Four a day.
- Yeah?

189
00:19:08,203 --> 00:19:09,371
- Twenty-four?
- Twenty-four.

190
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:10,972
What do you think about that, Creasy?

191
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:13,036
I think that you know entirely
more than you should.

192
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:14,461
Well, thank you.

193
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:40,194
<i>Hola, Miguel.</i>

194
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:44,603
- See you later.
- You have to sign.

195
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:49,006
- What?
- You have to sign in, show them your I.D.

196
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:52,547
Buenos días.
<i>Come on.</i>

197
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:55,615
Right there.

198
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:58,345
- Hola, Manuel.
<i>- Hola, Pita.</i>

199
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:11,031
<i>- ¡Hola, Pita!
- ¡Hola!</i>

200
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:15,331
Pita!
It's so good to have you back.

201
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:18,338
Sister Anna, this is
my new bodyguard, Creasy.

202
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,568
Sister Anna, the headmistress.

203
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:23,702
<i>Señor Creasy.</i>

204
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:25,712
Hurry. Class is about to begin.

205
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:28,146
- Go, go.
- Bye, Creasy.

206
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,741
<i>- Madre.</i>
- You must look after our Pita.

207
00:20:30,853 --> 00:20:33,048
It is not good that she's late today.

208
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:37,717
I'm very sorry. I, uh... I'll have to get
used to the rules. It won't happen again.

209
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:41,387
No offense, but I regret
that your profession needs to exist.

210
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:44,625
So do I, <i>Madre.</i> So do I.

211
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:48,692
Do you ever see the hand of God
in what you do?

212
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:52,432
No, not for a long time.

213
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,908
The Bible says,
"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome..."

214
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:59,447
"Overcome evil with good."

215
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:08,385
I'm the sheep that got lost, <i>Madre.</i>

216
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:14,847
When you were a kid, Creasy,
did you like school?

217
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:18,620
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

218
00:22:18,727 --> 00:22:22,629
No, I don't remember.
It, uh... Nah, I didn't like it.

219
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:24,790
Why not?

220
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,460
Because it wasn't a school like yours.

221
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:29,537
There was no, uh... no Sister Anna.

222
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:34,568
Were you unhappy?

223
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:40,179
Being unhappy, Pita, that's a state
of mind. I really don't remember.

224
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,718
What happened to your hand?

225
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:55,161
- It's a birth defect.
- No, it's not.

226
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:59,529
Look, no more questions, okay?

227
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:02,001
- It really wasn't a question.
- It sounded like a question.

228
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:04,698
<i>Look, I got a job to do. Hey!</i>

229
00:23:04,806 --> 00:23:07,036
No. <i>Gracias. Gracias.</i>
No. No.

230
00:23:07,142 --> 00:23:10,077
Listen to me.
I'm being paid to protect you, okay?

231
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:13,147
No, no, no. I'm being paid
to be your bodyguard.

232
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:16,342
<i>Look at me.
I'm not being paid to be your friend.</i>

233
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:20,012
<i>I'm being paid to protect you,
so no more questions. That's it. Period.</i>

234
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:26,521
<i>- You hear me?</i>
- Yes.

235
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:30,064
- And no crying.
- I'm not crying.

236
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:33,225
Well, don't start.

237
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:35,769
You gotta understand, this is a job.

238
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:38,669
In order for me to do...

239
00:23:38,774 --> 00:23:40,708
In order for... Wait a minute.

240
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:32,326
Yeah, come in.

241
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:40,094
Mr. Creasy.

242
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:43,000
I just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

243
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:45,073
I'm fine, thanks.

244
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:50,508
Is the food all right?
'Cause, uh, Maria told me you didn't eat.

245
00:24:50,612 --> 00:24:54,070
Uh... yeah, the food is great.

246
00:24:54,182 --> 00:24:56,673
I just wasn't that hungry tonight.

247
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:02,649
So you, uh, read the Bible?

248
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:06,387
Yeah, sometimes.

249
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:10,261
- Does it help?
- Yeah, sometimes.

250
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:15,866
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

251
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:20,834
How are you doing with Pita?

252
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:22,842
Fine. Fine.

253
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,209
Soon as she figures out that I'm
not her new toy, we'll be fine.

254
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:29,283
- Yeah, she told me about that.
- Okay.

255
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:33,013
- You don't have children, do you?
- I told you I didn't.

256
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:36,579
Well, they can be tenacious
when they want something.

257
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:41,025
- And Pita just wants to be friends.
<i>- Okay.</i>

258
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:44,758
But you're paying me to protect her, right?
Not to be her friend.

259
00:25:44,866 --> 00:25:46,834
Right?

260
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,535
So, uh...

261
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,165
look, maybe this isn't gonna work out.

262
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:58,235
Maybe your husband should find
somebody who's a little more sociable.

263
00:26:01,116 --> 00:26:03,016
No, you're right.

264
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:08,455
You're being paid to protect her...

265
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:11,924
and I'm confident that you'll do that.

266
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:19,831
I'll be coming with you tomorrow.
I hope that's all right.

267
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:53,725
<i>You think God
will forgive us for what we've done?</i>

268
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:22,126
<i>I'm tired of killin', Ray.</i>

269
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:30,800
<i>You think God will forgive us
for what we've done?</i>

270
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:34,398
<i>In my state, I couldn't...
I couldn't guard a corpse.</i>

271
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:37,000
<i>Talk all the time.</i>

272
00:27:37,112 --> 00:27:39,103
<i>You know, I'm no good at that.</i>

273
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:43,411
<i>You know, I'm no good at that.</i>

274
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:46,846
<i>You know how they say...</i>

275
00:27:48,924 --> 00:27:51,324
<i>a bullet always tells the truth?</i>

276
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:34,402
Yeah.

277
00:28:34,502 --> 00:28:36,663
- Hey.
- Crease.

278
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:38,466
What's wrong?

279
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:42,009
Hey, listen, you-you ever have a...

280
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,578
a nine-millimeter round
that didn't go off?

281
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:47,477
Well, yeah. Failure to fire.

282
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:50,710
I know.
Failure to fire and-and-and, uh...

283
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:53,686
You know, I pulled the trigger
and... and... and...

284
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:55,688
click, nothing.

285
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,088
You're talking about a bad primer.

286
00:28:58,193 --> 00:29:00,252
Yeah, I... Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

287
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:02,853
But I... You know, right, dimple.
Dimple on the primer.

288
00:29:02,964 --> 00:29:05,057
That may be.

289
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:08,761
Well, like we used to say...

290
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,738
a bullet always tells the truth.

291
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:20,674
Crease?

292
00:29:20,782 --> 00:29:23,444
- You all right?
- Yeah.

293
00:29:24,786 --> 00:29:27,118
What were you shooting at?

294
00:29:27,222 --> 00:29:29,349
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray.
I'm sorry I woke you.

295
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:33,917
No, I-it's okay. Nothin'.
I was watchin' TV.

296
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:36,862
Okay.

297
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,228
All right.

298
00:30:57,078 --> 00:30:59,638
Pita, you have a pencil?

299
00:31:04,152 --> 00:31:05,779
Thank you.

300
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:42,183
It's hard to get used to
the traffic down here.

301
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,383
Yeah. I'm very sorry.

302
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:07,177
- See you, baby.
- All right. See you later.

303
00:32:07,282 --> 00:32:09,546
- Hey. Don't forget your towel.
- Oh, thank you.

304
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:20,650
<i>Bye.</i>
Buenas días.

305
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:27,593
- You're a strong swimmer.
- I never win.

306
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,868
Thanks.

307
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:42,007
- So what do I do?
<i>- What do you think you should do?</i>

308
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,869
You're the fastest one in the water,
the slowest one off the blocks.

309
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:46,915
What do you think that means?
What do you gotta do?

310
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,415
Get faster off the blocks.

311
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:50,646
Get faster off the blocks.

312
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:54,119
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks.
- Yeah?

313
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:56,986
- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle.
<i>- Yeah, you'll be fine.</i>

314
00:33:57,091 --> 00:33:59,059
You'll be okay.

315
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:04,031
- I'll still be slow.
- You're not slow.

316
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:06,726
I never finish better than third.

317
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:09,701
All right.
Maybe you are slow then.

318
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,250
Go!
<i>¡Vamos!</i>

319
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:30,551
<i>¡Vamos, Bird!</i>

320
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:32,626
¡Vamos!

321
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:41,127
<i>How do you think he got out?</i>

322
00:34:42,904 --> 00:34:45,930
- I let him go.
- It's better to be free, right?

323
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,905
It's better for him.

324
00:34:49,877 --> 00:34:52,573
<i>Actually, he was driving me crazy.</i>

325
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:58,085
Good night.

326
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:05,053
Good night.

327
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:23,135
- See you in a couple of days. I love you.
- All right. Love you.

328
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:25,144
Be good. Come on, Lise.

329
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:27,738
All right, sweetheart.
We'll call you from Detroit.

330
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:28,849
Okay.

331
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,785
- I love you.
- Love you.

332
00:35:31,886 --> 00:35:33,854
- Okay. Bye, honey.
<i>- Señora.</i>

333
00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:36,048
- Bye.
- Oh. <i>Gracias.</i>

334
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:38,625
- Okay. Bye, honey!
<i>- Bye.</i>

335
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:41,024
- I love you.
- Love you.

336
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:47,395
I hate leaving her.

337
00:36:01,215 --> 00:36:03,342
Concentratin'?

338
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:05,681
Eyes are closed?

339
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:10,391
What happened?

340
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:13,016
- I flinched.
- You flinched? The gunshot holds no fear.

341
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:14,924
- Say it.
- The gunshot holds no fear.

342
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:17,463
The gunshot holds no fear!
Say it.

343
00:36:17,565 --> 00:36:19,533
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- Louder!

344
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:21,602
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- Louder!

345
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:23,414
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good.

346
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:24,726
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good.

347
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:25,829
You welcome the sound.

348
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,138
In fact, it's the sound
that sets you free.

349
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:31,478
You are a prisoner on this block
until that sound sets you free.

350
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:33,945
- Are you ready? Are you ready?
- Yes. Yes.

351
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:35,640
- Are you set?
- Uh-huh.

352
00:36:42,924 --> 00:36:44,892
- Creasy?
- Hmm?

353
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:48,155
- What's a concubine?
- Why do you ask?

354
00:36:48,262 --> 00:36:50,662
It's in my history book.

355
00:36:50,765 --> 00:36:53,495
- Oh.
- It's like a wife, right?

356
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:56,900
Yeah. Yes, uh... Can I see that?

357
00:36:57,004 --> 00:36:59,529
- Kind of a wife.
- Right there.

358
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,768
But the emperor of China
had 1,000 of them.

359
00:37:02,877 --> 00:37:04,811
Um...

360
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:09,008
Okay, like nowadays in-in the West,
they have one husband for one wife.

361
00:37:09,116 --> 00:37:11,676
But in the olden time cultures,
they had, uh...

362
00:37:11,786 --> 00:37:15,381
you know, different...
uh, different rules.

363
00:37:17,258 --> 00:37:20,022
- Why, you feel sorry for the husband?
- Yeah.

364
00:37:20,127 --> 00:37:22,527
Can you imagine my mom
multiplied by a thousand?

365
00:37:25,032 --> 00:37:29,025
Creasy. You're smiling.

366
00:37:29,136 --> 00:37:31,730
- What?
- You were smiling.

367
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,932
- No, I'm not. No, I was not.
- You were.

368
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,441
- You're not now, but you were.
- You were smiling. I wasn't.

369
00:37:36,544 --> 00:37:38,341
- You were.
- When?

370
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:40,937
- Like five seconds ago.
- I'm not smiling.

371
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:44,575
- A second ago you were.
- You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.

372
00:37:44,685 --> 00:37:46,880
- Six seconds ago I wasn't smiling.
- Ten seconds ago.

373
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:50,617
Ten seconds ago I was smiling. Okay, in the
next 10 seconds, let's see who smiles first.

374
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:58,392
- You smiled already. See? You did.
- Mmm!

375
00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:00,967
- No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.
- Yeah, you...

376
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:03,298
That's not a smile.
A smirk is different.

377
00:38:03,404 --> 00:38:07,272
They both start with "S," but they're
not the same... Do your homework.

378
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,343
You were.

379
00:38:12,513 --> 00:38:15,448
Bang!

380
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,984
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Come back, come back.

381
00:38:18,085 --> 00:38:20,918
Bang!

382
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:24,890
<i>Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop. Come here.</i>

383
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:27,324
<i>Hurry up, hurry up.
Set.</i>

384
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:29,157
Bang!

385
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:32,391
Bang!

386
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:36,904
You don't flinch when you hear
the gunshot, understand?

387
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:41,773
You listen for the sound.
You don't anticipate.

388
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:44,470
- Concentrate on the sound.
- You understand me?

389
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,945
They're gaining on you!
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Stop! Stop!

390
00:38:47,048 --> 00:38:50,176
Come on, get out.
Let's go again. Let's go again.

391
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:11,038
<i>- Gracias.</i> Come here, girl!
- Daddy!

392
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:13,936
Oh, I missed you so much.

393
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,703
- I missed you too.
- How are you doing? I got a surprise for you.

394
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:19,006
- You do?
- Ready?

395
00:39:19,113 --> 00:39:21,604
- Huh?
- You got me a dog! You finally got me a dog!

396
00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:25,208
<i>- Huh?
- You bought me a dog, finally! Oh, my God!</i>

397
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,446
<i>- What do you think?</i>
- Oh, my gosh.

398
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:30,524
- Just what I wanted. What's his name?
- Sam, like Dad.

399
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:33,458
Great! Come on, Sam!
Come on, Sam!

400
00:39:33,561 --> 00:39:35,529
- State.
- Mm-hmm.

401
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:40,963
Bhutan.
It's a Himalayan kingdom.

402
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:44,560
<i>They were having some problems
with their royal family not that long ago.</i>

403
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:47,402
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
- Okay.

404
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:50,705
Any more questions?

405
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:52,711
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- What?

406
00:39:52,813 --> 00:39:54,804
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

407
00:39:54,915 --> 00:39:57,679
<i>What kind of question is that?
You're supposed to be studying history.</i>

408
00:39:57,684 --> 00:40:00,842
- That is history. Creasy history.
- No, that's ancient history.

409
00:40:00,855 --> 00:40:03,182
<i>- No more questions.</i>
- Who was your very first girlfriend?

410
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,682
Nonya. Nonya business.
That's who.

411
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:09,925
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Hi.

412
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:13,728
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita,
could you take me to get my hair done?

413
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:16,564
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

414
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:20,232
Well, um, I'll leave you two
to your history.

415
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:24,606
- Good night.
<i>- Good night, honey.</i>

416
00:40:27,181 --> 00:40:29,741
- Okay, now ask me.
- Ask you what?

417
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:39,183
Go, Pita, go. Go!
Go, go, go, go!

418
00:40:41,362 --> 00:40:43,853
Go, go, go, go, go.

419
00:40:43,964 --> 00:40:46,262
¡Bravo! ¡Muy bien!

420
00:40:47,568 --> 00:40:49,763
- 10.99.
- Yes!

421
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,304
<i>Whoo!</i>

422
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:55,637
- I'm tough, Creasy.
- No such thing as tough.

423
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:58,109
There's trained, then there's untrained.

424
00:40:58,212 --> 00:40:59,907
<i>- Now, which are you?</i>
- Trained.

425
00:41:00,014 --> 00:41:02,209
Trained. Okay. Let's go again.

426
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:12,785
- Here.
- Stand here near the finish line.

427
00:41:12,893 --> 00:41:14,827
Okay. Hey.

428
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:18,126
I'm a prisoner in the block
until the gunshot sets me free.

429
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:20,232
Don't smile, don't fool around
if you want to win.

430
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:20,834
Okay.

431
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:22,935
- You want to win? Trained or untrained?
- Trained.

432
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:25,035
Go.

433
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:29,676
<i>- Señor Creasy,</i> nice to see you.
- Oh, good to see you, <i>Madre.</i>

434
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:32,678
Pita's parents are away
on business in Juárez. I was...

435
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,408
Today you are her father.

436
00:42:57,932 --> 00:43:00,492
<i>Pita Ramos!</i>

437
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,641
I won!
Creasy! I won!

438
00:43:09,743 --> 00:43:13,338
- Okay.
- I won!

439
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:26,723
- Once upon a time, when <i>we</i> were young...
- When I was young.

440
00:43:26,827 --> 00:43:29,921
Well, when we were young
and he was younger...

441
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,760
all heads turned our way.

442
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:35,529
We made a deal
to take the world together.

443
00:43:35,636 --> 00:43:39,470
<i>Yeah, then one day
I got a call, and he said...</i>

444
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:42,872
"I'm in love! I'm in love!"

445
00:43:42,977 --> 00:43:45,741
<i>"And I'm moving to Mexico."</i>

446
00:43:45,846 --> 00:43:48,212
<i>And...
 I said...</i>

447
00:43:48,315 --> 00:43:50,978
"What happened to the plan?
What happened to it?"

448
00:43:52,086 --> 00:43:54,179
I said, "The plan's right here."

449
00:43:54,288 --> 00:43:56,756
Yeah. Yeah. And what'd I do?

450
00:43:56,857 --> 00:43:59,257
I hung up, then I met Alicia...

451
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,558
and then I went,
"Oh, now I got you! I got you."

452
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:06,394
I got it.
Can I kiss her? Is that...

453
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,129
Absolutely!
Hey, what are you doing?

454
00:44:15,843 --> 00:44:20,473
- You got me.
- Okay, I think now is a good a time as any.

455
00:44:23,384 --> 00:44:26,080
I bought it with my own money.

456
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:33,817
Open it.

457
00:44:38,198 --> 00:44:42,658
It's St. Jude,
patron saint of lost causes.

458
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,601
Wow.

459
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,474
Well deserved.

460
00:44:52,713 --> 00:44:55,307
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.

461
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:58,851
You're welcome.

462
00:45:47,534 --> 00:45:50,264
- Dad.
<i>- Yes, sweetie?</i>

463
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:52,271
Can I talk to you?

464
00:45:52,373 --> 00:45:54,500
Yes.

465
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:57,839
I don't want to play piano.
I want to swim.

466
00:45:57,945 --> 00:46:00,379
It's not open for discussion,
honey, okay?

467
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:04,349
Mr. Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher,
and if he accepts you as his student...

468
00:46:04,451 --> 00:46:06,419
you're gonna play the piano.

469
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,454
Whatever.

470
00:46:08,555 --> 00:46:11,023
Baby.

471
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:13,685
- I love you.
- I love you.

472
00:46:13,794 --> 00:46:15,915
I just want what's best
for you, you know that?

473
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,940
Okay.

474
00:46:17,297 --> 00:46:19,288
Okay, honey.

475
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:32,303
If you broke all my fingers,
then taped them back together...

476
00:46:32,413 --> 00:46:35,382
I wouldn't be able to play piano,
but I could still swim.

477
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:37,814
Sam, get back.

478
00:46:37,918 --> 00:46:40,785
Don't be a crybaby.
You're tougher than that.

479
00:46:40,888 --> 00:46:43,356
<i>Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.</i>

480
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:49,425
- Remember the day you wanted the pencil?
- Yeah.

481
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,021
I know why.

482
00:46:52,132 --> 00:46:55,590
- Yeah?
- You wanted the license number off of that car.

483
00:46:55,702 --> 00:46:58,398
I wrote it down in my notebook.

484
00:46:58,505 --> 00:47:01,269
I got it all but the last number.

485
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,435
I'll get it from you lat...
Can you belch?

486
00:47:04,545 --> 00:47:07,605
Burp. Can you burp?

487
00:47:11,018 --> 00:47:13,350
That's good. That's very good.

488
00:47:13,454 --> 00:47:16,514
- I just had a Coke.
- All right. Listen.

489
00:47:16,623 --> 00:47:18,921
Now, this teacher, this famous teacher...

490
00:47:19,026 --> 00:47:21,654
He teaches a lot of rich kids
and plays for the symphonies, right?

491
00:47:21,655 --> 00:47:22,236
Right.

492
00:47:22,262 --> 00:47:24,390
You belch every few minutes
while you're practicing.

493
00:47:24,998 --> 00:47:27,262
- Okay.
- You apologize to him, but you keep belching.

494
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:29,961
- You'll offend every sensibility he has.
- Okay.

495
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,801
Very good. You'll be back in the pool
in 24 hours, I guarantee you.

496
00:47:33,907 --> 00:47:37,035
Right, Sam?

497
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:44,178
- Hola.
- Lupita Ramos?

498
00:47:47,788 --> 00:47:50,348
For you, Creasy.

499
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,458
Thank you.

500
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:00,697
- How does this look?
<i>- Good.</i>

501
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:04,567
- Good.
- Hmm?

502
00:48:04,671 --> 00:48:07,231
<i>- Hola, Pita.
- Hola.</i>

503
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:09,866
- Bye.
- Bye.

504
00:48:10,978 --> 00:48:12,912
<i>Gracias.</i>

505
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,340
Pita.

506
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:52,778
Pita!

507
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:18,595
Pita!

508
00:50:20,374 --> 00:50:23,104
Pita!

509
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:33,309
Pita!

510
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:44,820
Run!

511
00:52:02,709 --> 00:52:05,109
Creasy!

512
00:52:05,212 --> 00:52:07,203
Creasy!

513
00:52:10,016 --> 00:52:12,416
Creasy. Creasy.

514
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:14,578
Creasy!

515
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:28,500
I can't...

516
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:33,239
Come on!

517
00:52:51,658 --> 00:52:55,321
<i>John W. Creasy is under arrest
for the murder of two police officers...</i>

518
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:57,260
<i>of the Judicial Police.</i>

519
00:52:57,364 --> 00:52:59,161
Creasy!

520
00:52:59,266 --> 00:53:01,157
<i>Also involved in the kidnapping of...</i>

521
00:54:58,184 --> 00:55:00,584
Excuse me.

522
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:09,487
Everybody relax, okay?
Relax, Sammy.

523
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,968
I know she's your little girl.

524
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:20,165
When I tell you everything's gonna be
all right, everything's gonna be all right.

525
00:55:21,942 --> 00:55:24,240
<i>Señor Ramos.</i>

526
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:35,254
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

527
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:39,451
Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division,
<i>Policia Judicial.</i>

528
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:42,858
Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus.
I'm the family attorney.

529
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:47,923
Speak slower, please.
My Russian is better than my English.

530
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:52,835
Well, I'm conducting the negotiations, and
we neither need nor want police assistance.

531
00:55:52,939 --> 00:55:56,602
We're gonna...
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.

532
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:00,646
<i>Señor Ramos,</i>
two police officers were killed...

533
00:56:00,747 --> 00:56:02,612
<i>during your daughter's abduction.</i>

534
00:56:04,017 --> 00:56:08,818
I have a written order
from <i>Ministerio Publico...</i>

535
00:56:08,922 --> 00:56:12,881
authorizing our participation
ex-officio.

536
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:19,797
If you want to speak to
Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.

537
00:56:21,968 --> 00:56:23,936
No. Okay.

538
00:56:24,037 --> 00:56:28,133
The kidnapper will tell you
to deliver the money alone.

539
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:30,835
<i>Por favor,</i> don't do that...

540
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:34,072
or you will find yourself
in a real Mexican hell.

541
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,809
No mariachi.
No tequila... and no Pita.

542
00:57:18,124 --> 00:57:21,059
<i>Crease.</i>

543
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:23,857
Crease.

544
00:57:23,963 --> 00:57:28,127
<i>When I heard it was
this hospital, I was so pleased.</i>

545
00:57:28,234 --> 00:57:31,465
There is a pastry shop nearby.

546
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:34,904
Delgado's. They have
the best pastries in Mexico.

547
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:38,535
Oh, Miguel Manzano...

548
00:57:38,645 --> 00:57:41,273
director of the A.F.I...

549
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:46,080
and a former director of Interpol...

550
00:57:46,186 --> 00:57:47,983
in Rome.

551
00:57:48,088 --> 00:57:51,489
- And you are?
- Friend of his. Rayburn.

552
00:57:51,591 --> 00:57:53,075
Rayburn?

553
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,560
Rayburn?

554
00:58:06,406 --> 00:58:07,998
<i>Hola.</i>

555
00:58:08,108 --> 00:58:11,635
Do you love your daughter, Señor Ramos?

556
00:58:11,745 --> 00:58:13,838
Yes. Yes.

557
00:58:13,947 --> 00:58:17,144
- Do you want to see her again?
<i>- Yes, I do.</i>

558
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:20,981
Señor, if your daughter's life...

559
00:58:21,087 --> 00:58:24,454
is as important to you as it is to me...

560
00:58:24,557 --> 00:58:26,923
you will do as I say.

561
00:58:27,026 --> 00:58:30,621
- Yes?
- Okay. Yes.

562
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:33,426
- Crease. Can you hear me?
- Hmm.

563
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:39,165
You got four of them. All dead.

564
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:44,035
- Pita.
- It's, uh...

565
00:58:46,212 --> 00:58:50,672
It's been two days.
They're negotiating a ransom.

566
00:58:52,886 --> 00:58:56,549
These things take time, Mr. Creasy.

567
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,792
Crease.

568
00:59:04,998 --> 00:59:07,967
Don't fuck with me, all right?

569
00:59:13,807 --> 00:59:17,174
Do you have the 10 million?
Do you have the money?

570
00:59:17,277 --> 00:59:21,737
- Yes, we have the money.
- Now if you do as I say...

571
00:59:21,848 --> 00:59:26,046
the girl will be returned
exactly as she was taken.

572
00:59:26,152 --> 00:59:29,485
<i>But if you deviate from
the process in any way...</i>

573
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:34,956
I swear, you will never see her again.

574
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:38,030
I understand. Listen, I-I too worship
<i>la Virgin de Guadalupe.</i>

575
00:59:38,131 --> 00:59:39,928
I ask you if you understand.

576
00:59:42,802 --> 00:59:46,067
Hello, sir.
This is, uh, Mr. Ramos's attorney.

577
00:59:46,172 --> 00:59:49,403
<i>He's going through a very difficult
time here, but he understands.</i>

578
00:59:49,509 --> 00:59:52,967
<i>Do you understand?
Repeat the drop instructions.</i>

579
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:56,515
<i>Okay, the money, 10 million,
U.S., will be divided into...</i>

580
00:59:56,616 --> 00:59:59,813
<i>two 15-gallon black canvas bags,
each containing five million...</i>

581
00:59:59,919 --> 01:00:02,387
<i>which will be checked
at the bank by the K.R. Agent...</i>

582
01:00:02,488 --> 01:00:04,725
<i>then driven to the house
in an armored car</i>

583
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,950
where it will be transferred
to the delivery car.

584
01:00:07,026 --> 01:00:10,553
You got a flat tire here.

585
01:00:10,663 --> 01:00:13,962
This is for you.

586
01:00:14,067 --> 01:00:16,228
Hello. Yeah.

587
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:18,896
Listen, I need a driver to drive Samuel.

588
01:00:19,005 --> 01:00:21,235
<i>No.
Why?</i>

589
01:00:21,341 --> 01:00:25,141
He's got a bad ticker.
He's got a heart condition.

590
01:00:25,245 --> 01:00:28,408
Look, he's a nervous kid
who doesn't respond well to stress.

591
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:35,211
All right.
But the car will not be powerful.

592
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:40,452
Remove the trunk lid.
Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.

593
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:44,997
<i>You will arrive at
La Diana Fountain at 1:00 a.m.</i>

594
01:00:45,098 --> 01:00:49,967
You will drive around
the circle two times.

595
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:54,267
<i>Samuel will remove his shirt
and hold it out the window...</i>

596
01:00:54,374 --> 01:00:56,274
to I.D. The car.

597
01:00:58,912 --> 01:01:01,472
<i>There is a pay phone
on the southeast corner.</i>

598
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:07,019
<i>The phone will ring.
He will answer and wait for instructions.</i>

599
01:01:08,655 --> 01:01:11,954
<i>There is a map on the top of the phone.
Follow it.</i>

600
01:01:15,094 --> 01:01:16,959
<i>Perfecto.</i>

601
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,260
- What are you doing? He said no phones!
- Relax. Relax.

602
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:27,862
- I'm just trying to protect your daughter.
- Just get me there, please.

603
01:01:32,245 --> 01:01:37,205
- What's going on?
- Hospitals can be very dangerous places.

604
01:01:37,317 --> 01:01:41,185
Especially when you have
killed two corrupt cops.

605
01:01:53,566 --> 01:01:57,696
<i>Leave the money
in the trunk of the white car.</i>

606
01:01:57,804 --> 01:02:00,102
<i>Then return to your car.</i>

607
01:02:01,574 --> 01:02:03,633
<i>Do not look back.</i>

608
01:02:22,929 --> 01:02:26,990
<i>Remember, I'm a professional.</i>

609
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:31,230
<i>If you keep your word, I will keep mine.</i>

610
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:46,375
- Hello.
- Mr. Ramos.

611
01:02:46,486 --> 01:02:50,013
<i>You betrayed me.
You killed my nephew.</i>

612
01:02:50,123 --> 01:02:52,250
You took my money.

613
01:02:52,358 --> 01:02:56,795
<i>Señor Ramos...</i>

614
01:02:58,731 --> 01:03:04,192
All right. Get out of here, all of you.
Get the fuck out of my house!

615
01:03:04,303 --> 01:03:06,567
Okay, this is Lisa.

616
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:12,140
I'm Pita's mother.

617
01:03:12,245 --> 01:03:16,511
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened
to your nephew, but I beg you...

618
01:03:20,253 --> 01:03:24,417
This conversation is not being recorded.

619
01:03:26,993 --> 01:03:31,953
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I wish we had talked sooner, senora.

620
01:03:32,065 --> 01:03:35,330
I'm really sorry.

621
01:03:35,435 --> 01:03:39,462
Now it is too late.

622
01:03:48,014 --> 01:03:52,474
Fuck off! Get the fuck out
of my fucking house now!

623
01:03:53,886 --> 01:03:56,252
Get out!
Get out!

624
01:04:37,663 --> 01:04:39,631
Hey.

625
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:44,492
<i>Hey.</i>

626
01:04:44,604 --> 01:04:47,505
Hey, Ray.

627
01:04:49,909 --> 01:04:53,709
- Where am I?
- Well, it looks like a dog hospital.

628
01:04:57,683 --> 01:05:00,982
Manzano was afraid the cops
were gonna kill you.

629
01:05:03,022 --> 01:05:05,490
How ya doin', Doc?

630
01:05:08,895 --> 01:05:10,726
What's the matter?

631
01:05:15,101 --> 01:05:17,262
She's de... dead, Crease.

632
01:05:19,972 --> 01:05:21,872
<i>It's a mess.</i>

633
01:05:21,974 --> 01:05:24,340
<i>Somebody hijacked the drop, and, uh...</i>

634
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,107
<i>the kidnapper's nephew was killed...</i>

635
01:05:30,216 --> 01:05:32,684
so he k... he killed Pita.

636
01:06:04,116 --> 01:06:06,141
No.

637
01:06:13,426 --> 01:06:15,394
No.

638
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:24,126
Did you recognize any of these men?

639
01:06:25,638 --> 01:06:29,904
No. Does that make me a suspect?

640
01:06:30,009 --> 01:06:32,637
No.

641
01:06:32,745 --> 01:06:34,770
It would be convenient, but no.

642
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,839
Um, maybe you should show me
some pictures of some Mexican cops.

643
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:41,532
- Maybe we'll get somewhere then.
- Those were all policemen.

644
01:06:43,022 --> 01:06:45,149
Bad judicial cops.

645
01:06:46,325 --> 01:06:50,261
Protected by a brotherhood.

646
01:06:50,363 --> 01:06:52,263
Brotherhood?

647
01:06:54,133 --> 01:06:59,093
A brotherhood called <i>La Hermandad.</i>

648
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:14,786
You all set?

649
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:17,947
- Hmm?
- Right arm. Here.

650
01:07:20,926 --> 01:07:23,554
- Okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

651
01:07:23,663 --> 01:07:25,722
Let's go.

652
01:08:02,468 --> 01:08:07,201
- Somebody's on us.
- Yeah. Lois Lane.

653
01:08:07,306 --> 01:08:11,208
- Who?
- Mariana something, works for Reforma.

654
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,505
<i>Newspaper journalist.</i>

655
01:08:13,612 --> 01:08:16,945
Maybe she thinks you're a scoop.

656
01:08:18,984 --> 01:08:21,214
I'll get you up to the border.

657
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,778
A friend of mine will take you to San Diego,
drop you right at the naval hospital.

658
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:30,385
- I'm not going, Ray.
- What are you gonna do?

659
01:08:30,496 --> 01:08:33,590
Let's take a ride by the crime scene.
She can follow us.

660
01:08:43,142 --> 01:08:45,042
<i>Buenos días.</i>

661
01:09:44,871 --> 01:09:47,169
<i>Mr. Creasy?</i>

662
01:09:47,274 --> 01:09:49,970
A lot of people are looking for you.

663
01:09:50,076 --> 01:09:52,670
I'm Mariana Garcia Guerrero.

664
01:09:54,981 --> 01:09:56,949
Reporter for <i>Reforma.</i>

665
01:10:00,086 --> 01:10:04,022
- Nice to meet you.
- I found this across the street.

666
01:10:06,226 --> 01:10:09,320
Open it.

667
01:10:13,066 --> 01:10:15,694
It's <i>Santa Muerte.</i>
Death worship.

668
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:23,197
<i>- They've put a curse on you.</i>
- Ha. They're a little late.

669
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:31,546
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna get in my truck and leave.

670
01:10:34,754 --> 01:10:37,086
I can help you.

671
01:10:39,226 --> 01:10:43,219
There's a brotherhood called <i>La Hermandad.</i>

672
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:46,299
It protects high-ranking
government officials, corrupt police...

673
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:49,766
and organized crime at a level
that is too difficult for me to reach.

674
01:10:51,505 --> 01:10:53,405
Okay.

675
01:10:53,507 --> 01:10:58,342
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos
are victims of this organization.

676
01:10:58,445 --> 01:11:03,007
I want to expose them. Talk to me,
give me your story, then I can help you.

677
01:11:03,116 --> 01:11:05,778
<i>Please.</i>

678
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,757
Help me do what?

679
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:16,719
You're gonna help me do what?

680
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:19,060
You're a stranger here, no?

681
01:11:19,165 --> 01:11:21,224
That's right.

682
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:23,632
You're going to need friends
that know their way around.

683
01:11:25,939 --> 01:11:28,407
Okay.

684
01:11:28,508 --> 01:11:30,373
Okay, friend that's gonna help me.

685
01:11:32,812 --> 01:11:37,044
A pleasure to meet you. Tell your driver
to keep his distance next time.

686
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,414
All right, friend?

687
01:11:42,022 --> 01:11:44,650
<i>Sí.</i>

688
01:12:01,074 --> 01:12:02,974
You'll be stateside by supper time.

689
01:12:03,076 --> 01:12:05,874
I'm gonna need some help
first though, Ray.

690
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:08,914
<i>If you don't stop bleeding,
you won't last a day the shape you're in.</i>

691
01:12:09,015 --> 01:12:12,451
- Is that a yes or is that a no?
- Yeah.

692
01:12:12,552 --> 01:12:15,316
But I'm done killing.
I told you that.

693
01:12:15,422 --> 01:12:17,322
- Okay.
- Anything else is yours.

694
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:27,324
- You're talking about war.
- Exactly what I'm talking about.

695
01:12:27,434 --> 01:12:30,130
Can you help me?

696
01:12:30,236 --> 01:12:33,034
- Yeah.
- Good.

697
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,810
Creasy.

698
01:14:08,134 --> 01:14:10,034
Hmm.

699
01:14:44,637 --> 01:14:46,935
- What are you doing here?
- Oh.

700
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,010
Came to get my stuff.

701
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:59,585
Couldn't find my Bible.
I thought it might be in here.

702
01:14:59,686 --> 01:15:04,146
- I borrowed it.
- Okay.

703
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:08,287
It's crazy, huh?

704
01:15:08,394 --> 01:15:11,090
One week we're figuring out
which nightclub to go to...

705
01:15:11,197 --> 01:15:14,189
and the next thing I'm reading the Bible.

706
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:18,031
It's a good thing.
You hold on to it.

707
01:15:22,408 --> 01:15:27,436
I keep thinking, if only we hadn't...

708
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:33,044
It's like, um...

709
01:15:34,554 --> 01:15:36,954
my whole life,
all I've ever thought about...

710
01:15:37,056 --> 01:15:41,049
was what I could get for myself.

711
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:44,619
Even with my own baby.

712
01:15:46,499 --> 01:15:50,458
She needed me so much, and sometimes...

713
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:54,370
I felt like I had nothing to give her.

714
01:15:54,474 --> 01:15:57,102
Just, um, I don't know what to do.

715
01:15:59,813 --> 01:16:03,249
- What are you gonna do?
<i>- What I do best.</i>

716
01:16:03,349 --> 01:16:05,317
I'm gonna kill 'em.

717
01:16:06,753 --> 01:16:09,221
Anyone who was involved.
Anybody who profited from it.

718
01:16:09,322 --> 01:16:11,916
Anybody who opens their eyes at me.

719
01:16:13,526 --> 01:16:16,222
You kill 'em all.

720
01:16:43,723 --> 01:16:45,554
<i>Yla Browning.</i>

721
01:17:26,426 --> 01:17:30,294
<i>Hola.</i>

722
01:17:30,397 --> 01:17:32,456
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

723
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:35,626
- Mr. Creasy.
- Okay. I need the license...

724
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:37,464
Well, no, excuse me.

725
01:17:37,571 --> 01:17:41,098
I need the name and address of someone
whose license number is...

726
01:17:41,207 --> 01:17:42,765
C-5-T-K-8.

727
01:17:42,876 --> 01:17:46,107
That's C-5-T-K-8.

728
01:17:46,212 --> 01:17:49,443
I got everything but the last digit,
so I need 10 possible matches.

729
01:17:49,549 --> 01:17:52,677
And when do I find out
which of the 10 it is?

730
01:17:52,786 --> 01:17:55,516
- Eventually.
- Well, where do I reach you?

731
01:17:55,622 --> 01:17:59,285
I'll call you.

732
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:20,079
Jordan, Angola, Lebanon.
Yes, I know all of that.

733
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:25,482
He's an assassin. And you want to help him
identify the owner of a car for him?

734
01:18:35,662 --> 01:18:38,358
- Mariana.
<i>- Sí.</i>

735
01:18:47,407 --> 01:18:49,739
<i>Gracias.</i>

736
01:18:51,344 --> 01:18:53,244
Ciao.

737
01:19:26,813 --> 01:19:29,611
Now, Jorge Gonzales.

738
01:19:36,823 --> 01:19:38,848
Okay.

739
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:06,685
<i>What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?</i>

740
01:20:06,786 --> 01:20:08,754
<i>What I do best.</i>

741
01:20:10,523 --> 01:20:12,991
<i>Anyone who was involved.
Anybody who profited from it.</i>

742
01:20:13,093 --> 01:20:15,653
<i>Anybody who opens their eyes at me,
I'm gonna kill 'em.</i>

743
01:20:27,107 --> 01:20:29,166
Oh, God!

744
01:20:57,937 --> 01:21:00,428
<i>"Oye Como Va."</i>

745
01:21:23,096 --> 01:21:25,064
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

746
01:21:32,205 --> 01:21:34,105
Okay?
<i>Ahora.</i>

747
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:40,172
Huh?
You know who I am?

748
01:21:47,654 --> 01:21:49,679
Correct.

749
01:21:49,789 --> 01:21:51,484
Okay.

750
01:21:51,591 --> 01:21:53,821
Hey, hey, hey.

751
01:22:36,236 --> 01:22:38,101
<i>No sé nada.</i>

752
01:22:56,322 --> 01:22:58,984
<i>¡No sé! ¡No sé!</i>

753
01:23:18,544 --> 01:23:20,171
<i>Hmm?</i>

754
01:23:27,954 --> 01:23:30,821
<i>La Voice.</i>

755
01:23:50,209 --> 01:23:52,700
Okay.

756
01:23:52,812 --> 01:23:56,111
Okay.

757
01:25:12,792 --> 01:25:15,454
Okay. Well.

758
01:25:15,561 --> 01:25:17,620
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

759
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:21,029
Give me one cigarette, please.

760
01:25:21,134 --> 01:25:23,602
<i>- Sí.
- Okay.</i>

761
01:25:28,741 --> 01:25:31,039
<i>¿Bueno?</i>

762
01:25:32,979 --> 01:25:37,609
Okay, my friend.
It's off to the next life for you.

763
01:25:39,118 --> 01:25:42,554
I guarantee you, you won't be lonely.

764
01:26:06,813 --> 01:26:10,340
<i>Revenge is a meal best served cold.</i>

765
01:27:49,649 --> 01:27:51,742
<i>- La niña.</i>
- No.

766
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:54,081
<i>¿No?
Vamos.</i>

767
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:59,241
No?

768
01:29:02,121 --> 01:29:03,952
Hmm?

769
01:29:15,034 --> 01:29:18,333
I heard you speaking Spanish.
You're American, right?

770
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:20,302
- And so are you.
- Yeah.

771
01:29:20,406 --> 01:29:22,874
- Get out of here. Where are you from?
- I'm from New Jersey.

772
01:29:22,975 --> 01:29:24,340
- You from New Jersey?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

773
01:29:24,443 --> 01:29:26,673
I'm from New Jersey.
All right, listen to me.

774
01:29:30,016 --> 01:29:32,644
<i>All right.
Everything is done up by cell phone.</i>

775
01:29:32,752 --> 01:29:36,017
You just wait around for calls,
and we don't even have a fucking number.

776
01:29:36,122 --> 01:29:38,147
Who pays you?

777
01:29:38,257 --> 01:29:43,320
We got an A.T.M. Card. We take out 200
fucking measly dollars every two weeks.

778
01:29:45,064 --> 01:29:46,998
- Two hundred dollars?
- Yeah.

779
01:29:47,099 --> 01:29:49,397
- What's the PIN number?
- The what?

780
01:29:49,502 --> 01:29:51,333
The PIN number.
Code number.

781
01:29:55,107 --> 01:29:57,371
- Yeah.
- Good. You wouldn't lie to me, right?

782
01:29:57,476 --> 01:30:00,276
- I'm not lying, man.
- Did you kill her? You didn't kill her, did you?

783
01:30:00,379 --> 01:30:02,404
No.

784
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:07,085
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me!
Did you kill her?

785
01:30:07,186 --> 01:30:08,915
Oh, man, you're making me
fucking nervous.

786
01:30:09,021 --> 01:30:11,922
- Did you kill her?
- No way. The fucking boss did, or his brother.

787
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:17,356
- We never see his face.
- You're not lying to me, are you?

788
01:30:17,463 --> 01:30:19,693
No. Goddamn it! I'm telling you the truth!

789
01:30:19,799 --> 01:30:22,324
Tell me, who?
You never see whose face?

790
01:30:22,435 --> 01:30:24,767
<i>Well, we were in the other room...</i>

791
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:28,101
<i>and he was yellin' at the girl
'cause his nephew got killed...</i>

792
01:30:28,207 --> 01:30:30,607
<i>and the money got stolen.</i>

793
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:32,610
Wait, wait. Wh-What?
Somebody stole what money?

794
01:30:32,712 --> 01:30:35,510
- The ransom money at the drop.
- Who? Who stole it?

795
01:30:35,614 --> 01:30:38,014
- He said some fuckin' crooked cop took it.
- Who?

796
01:30:38,117 --> 01:30:40,278
- Fuentes.
- Fuentes?

797
01:30:40,386 --> 01:30:42,445
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

798
01:30:42,555 --> 01:30:45,183
<i>All right? Huh?
Jersey boy?</i>

799
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:49,193
Yeah. Now.

800
01:30:50,463 --> 01:30:53,125
- This Fuentes guy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

801
01:30:53,232 --> 01:30:55,632
<i>He's a lieutenant for the
Anti-Kidnapping Division.</i>

802
01:30:55,735 --> 01:30:58,226
Fuentes is. What'd you do?

803
01:30:58,337 --> 01:31:00,897
- Oh, man.
- Tell me about the girl. What'd you do?

804
01:31:01,006 --> 01:31:03,566
<i>- Huh? What'd you do?</i>
- I just do what they told me.

805
01:31:03,676 --> 01:31:05,375
- You do what they tell you to do?
- Yeah.

806
01:31:05,477 --> 01:31:07,545
Did you say good-bye to her?
Answer my question.

807
01:31:07,747 --> 01:31:09,738
- Did you say good-bye to her?
- No!

808
01:31:09,849 --> 01:31:12,317
- You didn't? Here's your chance. Say good-bye.
- Oh, shit!

809
01:31:12,418 --> 01:31:15,148
Say good-bye to her.
Say good-bye to her.

810
01:31:15,254 --> 01:31:17,381
Fucking let me go!

811
01:31:20,025 --> 01:31:22,391
Rico?

812
01:32:03,569 --> 01:32:05,469
Okay. Okay.

813
01:32:22,421 --> 01:32:23,945
<i>- No?</i>
- No.

814
01:32:41,607 --> 01:32:43,438
<i>Sí.</i>

815
01:32:46,145 --> 01:32:48,409
<i>Sí.</i>

816
01:34:23,542 --> 01:34:25,669
<i>- Sí, Guerrero.</i>
- Listen, it's me.

817
01:34:25,778 --> 01:34:28,872
Yeah, it's me. You know anything about
a young girl being kidnapped recently?

818
01:34:28,981 --> 01:34:32,144
- She's about 12 years old?
- Yes, that's last night.

819
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:33,980
- Do you know something?
- What's her name?

820
01:34:34,086 --> 01:34:36,077
Uh, Camilla. Camilla Valencias.

821
01:34:36,188 --> 01:34:39,487
<i>¿Camilla?
¿Se llama Camilla?</i>

822
01:34:39,592 --> 01:34:41,423
<i>- Sí.</i>
- Okay. I got her.

823
01:34:41,527 --> 01:34:44,257
Where are you?

824
01:35:13,993 --> 01:35:16,791
<i>- Creasy, what happened?
- It's okay.</i>

825
01:35:16,895 --> 01:35:18,863
Sit down. Relax.

826
01:35:18,964 --> 01:35:21,797
She's okay. She's okay.
You got banking connections?

827
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:25,301
Yes, I have connections.

828
01:35:27,006 --> 01:35:30,021
Okay.
The PIN number's 4747.

829
01:35:30,342 --> 01:35:33,834
I wanna find out who's
putting money in that account.

830
01:35:33,946 --> 01:35:37,507
4747.

831
01:35:37,616 --> 01:35:40,050
What do you know
about a cop named Fuentes?

832
01:35:40,152 --> 01:35:42,382
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division.

833
01:35:42,488 --> 01:35:44,888
<i>He's the one who drove
Samuel Ramos to the drop.</i>

834
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:46,582
- Fuentes?
- Sí.

835
01:35:46,692 --> 01:35:47,692
Who is she?

836
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:49,910
<i>You can ask her later.
She'll tell you anything.</i>

837
01:35:50,796 --> 01:35:53,594
- What do you know about him?
- About Fuentes?

838
01:35:53,699 --> 01:35:57,100
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000
and a dead body in the trunk of his car.

839
01:35:57,202 --> 01:35:58,897
- Huh.
<i>- Never charged.</i>

840
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:01,871
Arresting officer couldn't testify
'cause he was dead.

841
01:36:03,475 --> 01:36:05,875
- Is he <i>La Hermandad?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

842
01:36:05,978 --> 01:36:09,505
- You know where he lives?
- He lives in a judicial compound.

843
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:14,351
He travels by motorcade.

844
01:36:17,723 --> 01:36:20,089
<i>Creasy, he's better protected
than the president of Mexico.</i>

845
01:36:20,192 --> 01:36:22,456
He's gonna need it.
You gonna take care of her?

846
01:36:22,561 --> 01:36:25,086
- Yes. Well, how can I find you?
- I'll find you.

847
01:36:52,858 --> 01:36:56,794
This is my jurisdiction.

848
01:36:56,895 --> 01:37:01,298
I want this man as much as Creasy does.

849
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:06,463
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend
than 10 years of your courts and tribunals.

850
01:37:06,572 --> 01:37:09,905
- Just stay out of his way.
- I plan to.

851
01:37:17,349 --> 01:37:20,807
I will even help him, if I can.

852
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:25,083
But, uh, I would like to understand him.

853
01:37:26,925 --> 01:37:28,586
Give me that.

854
01:37:28,694 --> 01:37:31,322
Pita Ramos...

855
01:37:32,898 --> 01:37:34,798
that's a number to you.

856
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:39,837
You know, one more dead, but a number.

857
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:42,532
What was she to Creasy then?

858
01:37:42,641 --> 01:37:45,474
She showed him
it was all right to live again.

859
01:37:48,614 --> 01:37:52,675
And the kidnappers took that away, huh?

860
01:37:52,785 --> 01:37:56,744
And they're gonna wish
they never touched a hair on her head.

861
01:37:58,323 --> 01:38:01,520
A man can be an artist...

862
01:38:04,429 --> 01:38:07,057
in anything... food, whatever.

863
01:38:07,166 --> 01:38:11,728
It depends on how good he is at it.

864
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,040
Creasy's art is death.

865
01:38:19,912 --> 01:38:23,712
He's about to paint his masterpiece.

866
01:38:31,089 --> 01:38:33,557
I don't have anything else to say.

867
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:04,808
Shh. Shh.

868
01:40:23,368 --> 01:40:25,700
Forgiveness is between them and God.

869
01:40:25,804 --> 01:40:28,705
It's my job to arrange the meeting.

870
01:42:25,057 --> 01:42:27,787
Don't move.
Put your hands down. Put 'em down.

871
01:42:36,501 --> 01:42:39,129
<i>Señor John W. Creasy...</i>

872
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:42,729
<i>is under arrest for the murder
of two officers of the Judicial Police.</i>

873
01:42:44,843 --> 01:42:47,937
<i>He's suspected of possible involvement...</i>

874
01:42:48,046 --> 01:42:51,504
<i>of possible involvement in
the kidnapping of Lupita Ramos.</i>

875
01:43:21,513 --> 01:43:24,311
Can you hear me?
Huh?

876
01:43:25,951 --> 01:43:27,919
Know where we are?

877
01:43:29,154 --> 01:43:33,523
We're under the bridge
where the deal went bad.

878
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:38,392
The ransom got stolen.
You wanna tell me what happened?

879
01:43:38,497 --> 01:43:41,159
- Have you heard of <i>La Hermandad?</i>
- Yes, I have.

880
01:43:41,266 --> 01:43:43,166
<i>- Do you know what it is?</i>
- Yes.

881
01:43:43,268 --> 01:43:45,395
I'm the president of <i>La Hermandad.</i>

882
01:43:45,504 --> 01:43:47,199
- You're the president?
- Yes.

883
01:43:47,305 --> 01:43:49,398
<i>The president?</i>
Wow.

884
01:43:49,508 --> 01:43:51,567
Look at me.

885
01:43:52,844 --> 01:43:55,244
Oh, you can't.
 I'm sorry.

886
01:43:55,347 --> 01:43:57,406
How's that?

887
01:44:05,957 --> 01:44:07,925
Let me show you what I got here.

888
01:44:09,861 --> 01:44:13,388
See this? This is a charger. It's used
by convicts to hide money and drugs.

889
01:44:13,498 --> 01:44:17,195
They stick it in their body.
They tuck it up their rectum.

890
01:44:17,302 --> 01:44:20,533
You familiar with that?
This... Look at me.

891
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:23,403
Pencil detonator.

892
01:44:23,508 --> 01:44:27,239
Timer, used as a receiver-transmitter.

893
01:44:27,345 --> 01:44:30,371
C-4. Highly explosive.

894
01:44:30,482 --> 01:44:32,712
You put 'em all together, you got a bomb.

895
01:44:32,817 --> 01:44:35,377
Not very sophisticated,
but very powerful.

896
01:44:37,589 --> 01:44:40,217
That's what you have in your ass right now.

897
01:44:40,325 --> 01:44:43,692
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move.

898
01:44:47,966 --> 01:44:50,434
Cheap watch. Pager watch.

899
01:44:50,535 --> 01:44:56,167
Used to send a page to the receiver
that's up your behind right now.

900
01:44:56,274 --> 01:44:59,471
<i>So, I'm gonna send you a page...</i>

901
01:44:59,578 --> 01:45:01,478
which you will receive...

902
01:45:04,649 --> 01:45:07,140
in five minutes.

903
01:45:07,252 --> 01:45:09,482
Now.

904
01:45:14,326 --> 01:45:16,726
You got less than five minutes
to tell me what went down...

905
01:45:16,828 --> 01:45:19,956
between your men and the kidnapper.

906
01:45:20,065 --> 01:45:21,896
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

907
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,628
- Four minutes and 30 seconds.
- Nothing. I don't know him.

908
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:28,433
<i>You don't know?
Four minutes and 25 seconds.</i>

909
01:45:30,575 --> 01:45:32,566
Four minutes and 20 seconds.
Are you sure?

910
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:38,280
Okay.

911
01:45:38,383 --> 01:45:41,614
I got all the time in the world.
You don't, but I do.

912
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:44,484
- Hey, relax, relax, buddy.
- I'm relaxed.

913
01:45:44,589 --> 01:45:47,456
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.

914
01:45:47,559 --> 01:45:50,323
I saw the opportunity, and I got lucky.

915
01:45:50,428 --> 01:45:51,918
And?

916
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:55,124
And I had my men ready as we
got instructions where to go.

917
01:45:55,233 --> 01:45:57,167
You had your men ready to steal the drop.

918
01:45:57,269 --> 01:45:59,703
<i>You had your men ready to kill
one of the kidnappers, yeah?</i>

919
01:45:59,804 --> 01:46:02,329
<i>You've done this many times.</i>

920
01:46:04,242 --> 01:46:07,541
- One of the nephews of the head kidnapper...
- Bingo. Bingo. Bingo.

921
01:46:07,646 --> 01:46:09,730
Bingo, yeah. You've done
this many times, huh?

922
01:46:09,755 --> 01:46:10,755
Many times, yeah.

923
01:46:10,815 --> 01:46:14,148
- Yeah. Killed many victims too, haven't you?
- Come on, sir.

924
01:46:14,252 --> 01:46:17,221
- We just make out as best we can.
- "As best we could"?

925
01:46:20,292 --> 01:46:23,386
Two minutes, 47 seconds.

926
01:46:24,863 --> 01:46:28,128
Wait-Wait a minute. Come on.

927
01:46:28,233 --> 01:46:30,497
- I have a little gift for you.
<i>- For me?</i>

928
01:46:30,602 --> 01:46:33,400
- Yeah. Come on. Come on.
- What do you got?

929
01:46:33,505 --> 01:46:37,635
<i>There was no $10 million.
There was one half in the bags.</i>

930
01:46:37,742 --> 01:46:40,472
The ransom was $10 million?
They put it in two bags.

931
01:46:40,578 --> 01:46:42,705
- Five million in each bag, right?
- Two bags, true.

932
01:46:42,814 --> 01:46:46,341
<i>But one has half paper...</i>

933
01:46:46,451 --> 01:46:49,545
<i>the other only paper.</i>

934
01:46:49,654 --> 01:46:53,556
Maybe your men stole it.

935
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:56,149
Whoever did it
took it before the exchange.

936
01:46:58,196 --> 01:47:01,165
Okay. At the Ramos house...

937
01:47:01,266 --> 01:47:05,896
before the exchange,
who put the bags in the car?

938
01:47:06,004 --> 01:47:08,268
- Guess what.
- What?

939
01:47:08,373 --> 01:47:11,672
Ramos lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.

940
01:47:11,776 --> 01:47:14,244
- Jordan Kalfus?
- Yeah.

941
01:47:16,881 --> 01:47:19,349
Pedro.

942
01:47:26,624 --> 01:47:29,115
Sir?
Please.

943
01:47:29,227 --> 01:47:31,923
I-I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry for the girl.

944
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:36,023
It was just business.
You know, I'm a professional.

945
01:47:36,134 --> 01:47:39,433
That's what everybody keeps saying.
"I'm just a professional."

946
01:47:39,537 --> 01:47:43,035
Everybody keeps saying that to me. "I'm just
a professional. I'm just a professional."

947
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:46,066
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing that.
You understand me?

948
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,815
What are you going to do now?

949
01:47:51,916 --> 01:47:54,043
What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna leave. I gotta go.

950
01:47:54,152 --> 01:47:57,315
- Yeah. I got...
- Come on. Come on. What about me, huh?

951
01:47:57,422 --> 01:48:00,391
- What about you? You got 40 seconds.
- Come on.

952
01:48:00,492 --> 01:48:04,929
- Thirty-five.
- A last wish, please. Please.

953
01:48:05,029 --> 01:48:10,262
Last wish?
I wish you had more time.

954
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:14,464
Hey! Hey, hey!

955
01:50:16,961 --> 01:50:20,590
Hola.

956
01:50:20,698 --> 01:50:23,326
<i>- Mariana, it's me.</i>
- Creasy, where are you?

957
01:50:23,434 --> 01:50:26,096
Listen, I got something
that looks like banking codes...

958
01:50:26,204 --> 01:50:28,069
from Bank Coast in the Cayman Islands.

959
01:50:28,172 --> 01:50:31,300
- I need it translated as fast as you can.
- Whose account is it?

960
01:50:31,409 --> 01:50:35,505
<i>Jordan Kalfus, and it looks like
U.S. Deposits and withdrawals.</i>

961
01:50:35,613 --> 01:50:37,547
<i>Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.</i>

962
01:50:37,649 --> 01:50:41,380
Samuel Ramos. That's it?

963
01:50:41,486 --> 01:50:43,215
- That's it.
- Okay.

964
01:51:18,456 --> 01:51:20,356
<i>Gracias.</i>

965
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,429
- Creasy.
- Samuel.

966
01:51:32,537 --> 01:51:34,528
<i>Honey?</i>

967
01:51:38,142 --> 01:51:40,508
What's going on?

968
01:51:42,313 --> 01:51:46,340
That's what I wanna know.
What is going on?

969
01:51:48,786 --> 01:51:51,687
<i>Huh, Sam?</i>

970
01:51:51,789 --> 01:51:54,019
I'm gonna ask your wife a couple
of questions, okay?

971
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:57,060
You move...

972
01:51:57,161 --> 01:51:59,186
<i>you make one sound...</i>

973
01:51:59,297 --> 01:52:02,391
I'll snatch the life right outta you,
you understand?

974
01:52:09,707 --> 01:52:12,403
What happened, Lisa, hmm?

975
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:14,410
Were you in on this?

976
01:52:14,512 --> 01:52:18,676
- Or was it just your husband, huh?
- Am I in on what?

977
01:52:18,783 --> 01:52:22,310
You know what I'm talking about... Pita's
kidnapping, her death. Were you a part of it?

978
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:25,719
- Pita got killed because the ransom got stolen.
- Shut up!

979
01:52:27,258 --> 01:52:29,624
Yeah, the money was stolen.
You're right. He's right.

980
01:52:29,727 --> 01:52:33,254
The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen though, huh?

981
01:52:33,364 --> 01:52:36,356
- $2.5 million, right?
- What are you talking about?

982
01:52:36,467 --> 01:52:39,628
He knows what I'm talking about. $2.5
million. That's what Victor got, isn't it?

983
01:52:39,704 --> 01:52:42,696
- What are you talking about?
- 2.5 million.

984
01:52:42,807 --> 01:52:45,105
<i>2.5 million to your lawyer Jordan Kalfus...</i>

985
01:52:45,209 --> 01:52:48,649
that he put in an account in the Cayman
Islands, but he won't get a chance to spend it.

986
01:52:51,683 --> 01:52:54,015
What happened to the other five, Sam?

987
01:52:54,118 --> 01:52:57,053
<i>Huh? That's 2.5, 2.5.
What is five from 10?</i>

988
01:52:57,155 --> 01:52:59,755
That's five. What happened to the
other five, Sam? Tell your wife.

989
01:52:59,791 --> 01:53:02,231
<i>- It's your chance to talk.
- What happened to the other five?</i>

990
01:53:02,326 --> 01:53:04,391
- You got a wife, Creasy?
- No, I don't have a wife.

991
01:53:04,395 --> 01:53:07,235
Then you'll never know how hard
it could be to tell your wife the truth.

992
01:53:07,264 --> 01:53:09,194
No, you have a wife!
You tell me what happened!

993
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,227
It was in this room
that my father prayed.

994
01:53:11,235 --> 01:53:13,931
- I don't give a fuck about your fucking father!
- My father prayed.

995
01:53:14,038 --> 01:53:15,540
<i>He prayed that his gambling debts</i>

996
01:53:15,565 --> 01:53:17,965
and his infidelities would be
forgiven right in this room.

997
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:20,738
- Samuel! I love you!
<i>- What, Lisa?</i>

998
01:53:20,746 --> 01:53:21,746
<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

999
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:23,770
<i>I didn't inherit a kingdom!
That's the truth!</i>

1000
01:53:24,749 --> 01:53:27,650
You wanna know the truth?
I inherited his debt and his mess.

1001
01:53:27,752 --> 01:53:30,672
- I inherited his lawyer Jordan...
- You tell me what happened to my baby!

1002
01:53:30,755 --> 01:53:33,315
Say it! Say it! Say it!

1003
01:53:33,424 --> 01:53:36,052
Say it! Say it!
Be a fucking man!

1004
01:53:39,864 --> 01:53:42,298
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room...

1005
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,800
and watch cartoons all day...

1006
01:53:44,902 --> 01:53:47,769
and she'd eat ice cream
and we'd have her back in two days.

1007
01:53:47,872 --> 01:53:50,466
He lied to me!

1008
01:53:50,575 --> 01:53:53,442
That's why he's fucking dead!
I did it!

1009
01:53:53,544 --> 01:53:55,603
I did it, Lisa!

1010
01:53:55,713 --> 01:53:58,443
I agreed to the kidnapping.

1011
01:53:58,549 --> 01:54:01,985
I did it for us...
for the three of us.

1012
01:54:10,428 --> 01:54:12,555
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

1013
01:54:18,569 --> 01:54:20,537
You kill him.

1014
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:23,839
You kill him or I will.

1015
01:54:54,205 --> 01:54:56,173
Huh. You know, they say a, um...

1016
01:54:58,576 --> 01:55:01,704
<i>a bullet always tells the truth.</i>

1017
01:55:10,988 --> 01:55:12,956
It never lies.

1018
01:55:25,937 --> 01:55:30,203
It didn't work for me, Samuel, but maybe...

1019
01:55:32,476 --> 01:55:35,036
Maybe it'll work for you.

1020
01:55:44,355 --> 01:55:46,949
<i>I'll pray for you.</i>

1021
01:58:49,407 --> 01:58:51,307
Gracias.

1022
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:18,000
- ¿Hola?
- Hola.

1023
01:59:18,102 --> 01:59:20,593
<i>- Mr. Creasy?
- Yeah, it's me.</i>

1024
01:59:20,704 --> 01:59:22,965
<i>I traced the PIN for you
and I have an address.</i>

1025
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:24,874
<i>Yeah?</i>

1026
01:59:24,875 --> 01:59:28,333
<i>The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez,
the wife of "The Voice".</i>

1027
01:59:28,446 --> 01:59:32,712
<i>She lives in Los Arcos,
apartment 26D, Via Appia.</i>

1028
01:59:32,817 --> 01:59:35,285
<i>- Good.
- And another thing.</i>

1029
01:59:35,386 --> 01:59:39,186
<i>Pick up today's paper and you'll have
a picture of "The Voice."</i>

1030
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:41,258
<i>Good.
Thank you.</i>

1031
02:00:44,255 --> 02:00:46,348
Shh, shh, shh.

1032
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:51,754
<i>José?
¿Qué te pasa?</i>

1033
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:08,661
<i>Sí.</i>

1034
02:03:08,766 --> 02:03:10,734
Okay.

1035
02:03:18,309 --> 02:03:20,072
Hmm?

1036
02:03:26,583 --> 02:03:28,050
Hmm?

1037
02:03:39,163 --> 02:03:41,063
<i>Sí.</i>

1038
02:03:41,165 --> 02:03:43,156
Okay. Uh...

1039
02:03:47,504 --> 02:03:49,404
<i>- ¿Sí?
- Sí.</i>

1040
02:03:56,613 --> 02:03:59,241
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez. Okay.

1041
02:04:04,121 --> 02:04:06,021
Okay.

1042
02:04:14,465 --> 02:04:16,399
<i>Sí.</i>

1043
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:18,900
<i>Sí.</i>

1044
02:04:19,002 --> 02:04:20,936
Huh?

1045
02:05:17,795 --> 02:05:19,763
<i>Momento.</i>

1046
02:05:49,426 --> 02:05:51,360
<i>Hola,</i> Daniel.

1047
02:05:51,462 --> 02:05:53,327
Señor Creasy.

1048
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:56,797
Yeah. Yeah, I got your family here.

1049
02:05:56,900 --> 02:05:59,460
<i>Your brother doesn't look too good.</i>

1050
02:05:59,570 --> 02:06:02,835
<i>Yeah, Reina, she's what,
about eight months?</i>

1051
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:07,001
<i>Huh?
You wanna negotiate?</i>

1052
02:06:10,914 --> 02:06:14,577
The most important thing
in life is family.

1053
02:06:14,685 --> 02:06:16,880
<i>Do you agree?</i>

1054
02:06:18,088 --> 02:06:19,988
I agree.

1055
02:06:21,792 --> 02:06:24,260
And there you are.
You have my family.

1056
02:06:24,361 --> 02:06:27,228
Well, most of my family.

1057
02:06:27,331 --> 02:06:31,495
<i>My wife and I are separated.
You know how that is.</i>

1058
02:06:31,602 --> 02:06:35,368
Now, tell me seriously,
h-how much do you want?

1059
02:06:35,472 --> 02:06:37,235
Ah.

1060
02:06:39,776 --> 02:06:42,267
Your brother wants to speak to you.
Yeah, hold on.

1061
02:06:53,357 --> 02:06:56,520
I'm gonna take your family apart
piece by piece. You understand me?

1062
02:06:56,627 --> 02:06:58,686
Piece by piece. Shut up!

1063
02:06:59,897 --> 02:07:02,695
<i>I don't want your money!</i>

1064
02:07:02,799 --> 02:07:06,428
Do you understand me?
You understand me? I want you.

1065
02:07:39,570 --> 02:07:41,663
I'm listening.

1066
02:07:43,106 --> 02:07:46,473
<i>I'm listening, Daniel.
I'm listening.</i>

1067
02:07:52,683 --> 02:07:55,982
<i>All right, I will
give you a life for a life.</i>

1068
02:07:57,588 --> 02:08:00,148
Whose life?
What are you talking about?

1069
02:08:00,257 --> 02:08:03,021
<i>Whose life, Daniel?
I want you.</i>

1070
02:08:03,126 --> 02:08:06,618
I will give you her life for your life.

1071
02:08:06,730 --> 02:08:11,190
And in exchange, I will get my life back.

1072
02:08:11,301 --> 02:08:15,294
- What life? Whose life?
- The girl's. Pita's.

1073
02:08:19,209 --> 02:08:23,373
- Pita's dead.
-  Creasy!

1074
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:28,816
<i>I'm a businessman.
A girl dead is worth nothing. She's alive.</i>

1075
02:08:33,123 --> 02:08:35,091
All right.

1076
02:08:37,027 --> 02:08:39,222
I want proof of life. You hear me?

1077
02:08:39,329 --> 02:08:42,298
I want proof of life.
I want... I want...

1078
02:08:42,399 --> 02:08:44,833
I want the name of her bear.
What does she call her bear?

1079
02:08:44,935 --> 02:08:47,563
<i>You tell her to tell you...</i>

1080
02:08:47,671 --> 02:08:51,198
to tell me what she calls her bear.

1081
02:09:20,003 --> 02:09:22,597
- Yeah?
- Creasy.

1082
02:09:22,706 --> 02:09:25,698
<i>She calls the bear Creasy Bear.</i>

1083
02:09:41,625 --> 02:09:43,593
Okay.

1084
02:09:45,429 --> 02:09:48,023
O-Okay.

1085
02:09:48,131 --> 02:09:50,691
I give you your brother,
you give me the girl.

1086
02:09:52,436 --> 02:09:54,768
- All right.
- Where?

1087
02:10:38,448 --> 02:10:40,348
Hello?

1088
02:10:40,450 --> 02:10:43,112
Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.

1089
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:45,415
I think Pita's alive.

1090
02:10:47,224 --> 02:10:49,454
I can't take this anymore.

1091
02:10:49,559 --> 02:10:51,493
Take the road to Puebla.

1092
02:10:51,595 --> 02:10:54,462
Get off junction 34, south side.

1093
02:10:54,564 --> 02:10:56,589
I'll meet you there in two hours.

1094
02:11:41,912 --> 02:11:43,812
So where is she?

1095
02:11:46,349 --> 02:11:49,477
She's right over there.
You see those two cars out there?

1096
02:11:54,791 --> 02:11:58,056
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...

1097
02:11:58,161 --> 02:12:01,494
this is his brother.

1098
02:12:02,866 --> 02:12:04,993
Here.

1099
02:12:05,101 --> 02:12:08,832
I'm goin' up on the bridge to get Pita.

1100
02:12:08,939 --> 02:12:11,703
<i>If anything goes wrong,
you put it to his head.</i>

1101
02:12:13,276 --> 02:12:15,403
You pull the trigger, all right?

1102
02:12:16,446 --> 02:12:18,971
You understand?

1103
02:12:22,052 --> 02:12:24,418
You don't...

1104
02:12:24,521 --> 02:12:27,786
Let him loose until she's with you.

1105
02:12:27,891 --> 02:12:29,859
You got it?

1106
02:12:32,329 --> 02:12:34,991
And you don't wait for me, okay?

1107
02:12:37,734 --> 02:12:39,463
Yeah.

1108
02:12:39,569 --> 02:12:43,130
- You'll be all right. You okay?
- Yeah.

1109
02:14:28,311 --> 02:14:30,211
Creasy!

1110
02:14:31,982 --> 02:14:33,950
Creasy!

1111
02:14:35,118 --> 02:14:37,586
Creasy!

1112
02:14:53,870 --> 02:14:56,270
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1113
02:14:56,373 --> 02:14:59,069
They didn't hurt you?

1114
02:14:59,175 --> 02:15:01,507
Hi.

1115
02:15:04,247 --> 02:15:08,547
Your mother's waitin' for you. She's right
down there at the end of the bridge.

1116
02:15:08,651 --> 02:15:12,280
- Okay? You go home.
- Okay.

1117
02:15:12,389 --> 02:15:15,119
- All right.
- Where are you goin'?

1118
02:15:18,995 --> 02:15:21,463
I'm goin' home too.

1119
02:15:22,499 --> 02:15:24,399
I'm goin' to Blue Bayou.

1120
02:15:28,671 --> 02:15:31,299
Oh, Hey.

1121
02:15:31,408 --> 02:15:34,741
I got something for you.

1122
02:15:36,813 --> 02:15:38,804
I got the last number too.

1123
02:15:38,915 --> 02:15:41,748
I love you, Creasy.

1124
02:15:44,254 --> 02:15:46,916
And you love me, don't you?

1125
02:15:48,024 --> 02:15:50,117
Yes, I do.

1126
02:15:50,226 --> 02:15:53,423
With all my heart. Pita, go.

1127
02:15:53,530 --> 02:15:55,498
- Go. Run.
- Bye.

1128
02:16:09,045 --> 02:16:10,945
<i>¡Vamos!</i>

1129
02:16:11,047 --> 02:16:14,312
- Pita! Baby, come here. It's okay.
- Mom!

1130
02:16:14,417 --> 02:16:17,614
<i>- Mom!</i>
- Come on! Okay, I'll let you go now.

1131
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:19,779
<i>Mom!</i>

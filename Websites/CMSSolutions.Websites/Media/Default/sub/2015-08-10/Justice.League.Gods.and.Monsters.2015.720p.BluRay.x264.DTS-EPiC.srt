1
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:37,370
- We're at the end.
- Your egg is set, Lara.

2
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,638
All I have to do is add my genetic code.
Just one finger print.

3
00:00:46,144 --> 00:00:48,181
Zod!

4
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:52,783
An incubator pod.
So the rumors were true.

5
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:57,557
You should not have opposed me, Jor-El.

6
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:01,127
I still can't believe you allied
with those dolts on the Council.

7
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,396
We could have ruled Krypton.

8
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,615
You've destroyed this planet.

9
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:10,570
- I was given insufficient data.
- I told you. We all told you!

10
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,971
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Zod, please!

11
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:19,362
I had a war machine to operate.

12
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:22,148
My army needed the energy.
We had to drill.

13
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:28,018
Your numbers were inconclusive, useless.
I had the vision. I had the will.

14
00:01:30,722 --> 00:01:33,824
If anyone's seed is going
to be spread to the heavens,

15
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,127
it will be mine.

16
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:40,697
You should feel honored, Lara.

17
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,471
Upon your egg, I bestow my eminence.

18
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,138
Ours will be the last child of Krypton.

19
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:07,474
Go! Make the universe feel your might.

20
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:46,052
- What was in it?
- We don't know, Mr. Luthor.

21
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,320
The farmer said it was open
when he found it.

22
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,889
Search the area.

23
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,693
I want the ship taken to STAR Labs,
code black, Sergeant.

24
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,138
None of this gets out.

25
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:17,634
<i>Apúrate. Apúrate.</i>

26
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:20,550
<i>Vamos.</i>

27
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:45,342
Knock, knock.

28
00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:49,381
- How long has this been down there?
- Too long.

29
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,066
<i>Superman!</i>

30
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,085
<i>Superman, where are you?</i>

31
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:57,490
<i>Mr. Trevor, what raid would be complete
without your cautionary tones?</i>

32
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,226
<i>We found their bunker,
under the Kasnian Embassy.</i>

33
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,428
Don't do anything until we get there!

34
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,995
<i>Hear me? Stay back!</i>

35
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,136
We disappoint again.

36
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:59,582
Send it now!

37
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:44,227
Hurry, God damn it!

38
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:27,204
Jesus!

39
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:37,900
- The cavalry arrives.
- Too bad the movie's over.

40
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,453
Nice little blood bath.
Was this really necessary?

41
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:44,223
They got... rambunctious.

42
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,525
You realize this is embassy property.

43
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,094
Technically, it's off limits
to law enforcement.

44
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:50,696
Technically, we're not the police.

45
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,099
Don't get wise with me.
The old lady's not gonna like this.

46
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:57,002
What are you talking about?
She'll be positively orgasmic.

47
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:00,454
She gets her stolen files back
plus a couple dozen wanted terrorists,

48
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:02,241
wanted no more.

49
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,607
She'll think it's Christmas.

50
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:13,650
Get me the President, and a mop.

51
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:18,640
<i>These are aliens and inhumans
watching over us.</i>

52
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,793
<i>Who's watching over them?</i>

53
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,395
<i>For the</i> Bible <i>sayeth,
"I am the Lord your God.</i>

54
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,231
<i>"You shall have no other gods
before me."</i>

55
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,732
Fangs for sale! Batman fangs!
Wonder swords!

56
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,007
Don't they ever shut up?

57
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,977
<i>At least fifty dead
in the embassy massacre.</i>

58
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,412
<i>And not just dead, dismembered,</i>

59
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:45,117
<i>burned alive, sucked of their blood,
a virtual house of horrors.</i>

60
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,287
<i>Granted, the victims were
part of a terrorist organization.</i>

61
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,989
Wondered when you'd mention that.

62
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,894
<i>But what about our terrorist organization?
What about the Justice League?</i>

63
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,679
<i>It's not like we haven't been warned.</i>

64
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,466
<i>What the government has sanctioned
is more than a super SWAT team.</i>

65
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:05,471
<i>It's a weapon of absolute power.
And we all know where that leads.</i>

66
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,173
<i>Sooner or later the ties
between the Oval Office</i>

67
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:12,444
<i>and the tower of so-called justice
will finally fray.</i>

68
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:16,847
- <i>And then, who will be in control?</i>
- Not you, buddy. Not anymore.

69
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:21,487
Why do you even listen? They hate us.

70
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,123
Don't let the crowds down there
fool you, Bekka.

71
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,594
They are not <i>la gente comun,</i>
the real people.

72
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,630
There are many who would like
nothing more than for us to take over.

73
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,985
- Tell her, Kirk.
- 22% domestically, 29% worldwide.

74
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:38,170
Revolutions have been built on less.

75
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,306
Imagine ending all
the ideological squabbling.

76
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,658
No more war, no more insurrections.

77
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:47,262
All those little dots down there connected
to a single productive purpose.

78
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,932
A world brought together as one.

79
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:53,688
- Under us?
- Under us.

80
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:56,322
You just got less sexy.

81
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,326
I'm not saying that I would, but things
aren't getting any easier with Washington,

82
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,512
and the day may be fast coming
when we'll have to consider our options.

83
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:07,016
The new world order will have to wait.
Your appointment's here.

84
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:09,574
- Who'd you get this time?
- Silas Stone,

85
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:12,768
one of the most brilliant men
on the planet.

86
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,081
Dr. Stone.

87
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,437
You move quickly.

88
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:26,916
I'm eager to get to work,
if you're ready.

89
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:35,338
Don't be nervous.
Think of it as a grand adventure.

90
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:43,135
- <i>Vic, are you there?</i>
- Yeah, Hank, what's up?

91
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:47,106
<i>The storm front's coming in faster
than expected. You better get back here.</i>

92
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,528
Warm up the brandy,
I got one reading left.

93
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,093
What the hell?

94
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:12,858
Thought you'd get away, huh?

95
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,129
I only wish I could be there when the senate
committee gets a load of this pony show.

96
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,999
I just finished my speech
this afternoon.

97
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,634
Molecular miniaturization,

98
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:26,002
a big idea for a shrinking world.

99
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:31,243
I don't think you'll have
to say much, Dr. Palmer.

100
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,442
Thanks, Ryan.

101
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:53,165
- <i>Please leave a message.</i>
- It's your husband.

102
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,734
Remember how you wanted stables
in the backyard?

103
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,335
We might have the room, after all.
Call me back.

104
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:37,436
<i>Every time I call you,
your place looks gloomier and gloomier.</i>

105
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,138
<i>Couldn't you brighten it up, Kirk?</i>

106
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,341
Even in college you had those
god-awful Beastie Boy posters.

107
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:47,144
- Tell him to put up some drapes.
- Drapes? How about some windows?

108
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:50,115
- <i>Is that Tina?</i>
- How's my favorite bat guy?

109
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,217
<i>Cooking up a batch of fake plasma.</i>

110
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,567
Yum! Thank you.

111
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,992
Don't get married, Kirk.
Wives will protect the life out of you.

112
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:03,862
<i>No worries, I've pretty much
given up on eHarmony.</i>

113
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:07,966
Listen, I want you to know I'm not
having luck with the latest tests.

114
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:11,436
Every time I try to reverse the antigen,
the cellular walls don't hold.

115
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:14,239
- <i>I didn't think they would.</i>
- Don't give up hope.

116
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,043
We'll figure out a cure for you.
What was made can be unmade.

117
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,177
Thanks, Tin.

118
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,081
- It just...
- <i>Takes time.</i>

119
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,984
Yeah. But that's not why I called.

120
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,153
You must have heard
Ray Palmer's missing.

121
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:33,025
His truck was totaled. Poor Jean.
She's been calling Tina ten times a day.

122
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,694
<i>That's upstate, Will,
not my jurisdiction.</i>

123
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:40,399
Since when does the Justice League have
a jurisdiction? Come on, Kirk, it's Ray!

124
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:44,836
<i>I'll check into it, but it's not going
to win me any friends with the local cops.</i>

125
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:47,737
So? People don't like you anyway.

126
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,306
<i>Good point.</i>

127
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:04,456
One more micro booster
and I could take out a tank.

128
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,926
- Now will you tell me?
- I told you everything.

129
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:10,963
Come on, Dad, what was he like?
What'd he say?

130
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,165
He was tall.

131
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:18,620
Oh, jeez, I know what he looks like.
Weren't you freaked? He's a killer alien.

132
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,440
Dude could have probably hurt you
just by looking at you real hard.

133
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,052
He was very matter-of-fact.
He said he had a job for me.

134
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:27,446
- And I'm doing it.
- Which is?

135
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,203
Can't say.

136
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:31,493
But I did see Wonder Woman.

137
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,884
Tell me, tell me!
And don't say she was tall.

138
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,799
She was...

139
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:46,179
What the hell's that?

140
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:51,022
Run!

141
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:56,305
Go!

142
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,943
Oh, shit!

143
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:48,126
So what brings the Feds?

144
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:52,414
Mr. Stone worked for the military,
Ms. Lane. This is purely routine.

145
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:54,374
That a fact?

146
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:02,591
I want to look around.

147
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:06,027
I don't suppose I could dissuade you.
This is a crime scene.

148
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:08,394
I won't touch a thing.

149
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:11,816
Your boyfriend has a lot of nerve.

150
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,251
He's not my boyfriend. And yes, he does.

151
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,293
<i>Dios mio.</i>

152
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:31,653
Only the police are allowed
beyond the yellow tape, Ms. Lane.

153
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,219
I don't see your badge.

154
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:39,008
Good one. Think your logic
will persuade this guy?

155
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:42,914
- Yeah.
- <i>Stone isn't our only dead scientist.</i>

156
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:45,481
<i>How fast can you get back here?</i>

157
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,154
This is Victor Fries,
the thermal expert.

158
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,390
Nobel and Kyoto prizes.

159
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,094
He was measuring atmospheric carbon levels
near the Arctic Circle three days ago.

160
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,264
They found his body
at the bottom of a ravine.

161
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,133
It wasn't the fall
that killed him, though.

162
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,034
His carotid artery was severed,

163
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:06,922
presumably by the ice
he hit on the way down.

164
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:10,830
- He bled to death.
- Yes, except they can't find the blood.

165
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:13,778
There should've been a pool
of frozen blood around the neck,

166
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:17,449
maybe as much as a half quart.
It's not there.

167
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,718
This is Ray Palmer's truck.

168
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,253
It was found a couple of days ago
at the bottom of a hill.

169
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:24,556
It appears to have been sliced up.

170
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,659
But that's not the most
intriguing damage.

171
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,929
A boot print,
as if the truck was kicked.

172
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,399
The size is rather diminutive
and has a pronounced heel.

173
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,135
- A woman.
- So it would seem.

174
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,803
They haven't found Palmer's body yet,

175
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:41,173
but no one's expecting him
to show up at the office.

176
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:45,610
And here's where you just came from.
What remains of Stone's lab.

177
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,512
I put it through some filters.

178
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:50,915
The streaks in spotting are hot spots
where the fire started.

179
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:54,819
It's as if someone went through
Stone's lab with a pair of blow torches.

180
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,223
- Or heat vision.
- Yes, I thought that might occur to you.

181
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:03,595
We're being framed. Someone's actually
trying to frame the Justice League.

182
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,364
Who would have the balls?

183
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,600
It's not going to be long before
the police start putting it together.

184
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,035
Maybe they already have.

185
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:13,104
And you can bet someone's
going to leak it to the press.

186
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:15,173
Anything connect these scientists?

187
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,475
They all worked together
at one time or another.

188
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:20,011
Government projects, usually top secret.

189
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:23,081
Stone was a visiting professor
at Gotham University.

190
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,550
I thought I'd check out his files.

191
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,520
You still friendly with Trevor?
He might be useful.

192
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,457
- He often was.
- Stay on top of him.

193
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,992
You know what I mean.

194
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,728
We've got to get ahead of this thing.
That includes the media.

195
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:40,796
Someone's trying to screw with us
and they're going to be damn sorry.

196
00:21:58,181 --> 00:21:59,549
"Fair Play."

197
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,228
Fries, Palmer, Stone...

198
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:09,035
Magnus.

199
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:27,517
Luthor's boys.

200
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,150
That's it.

201
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,870
Remember, you are the best
your generation has to offer.

202
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,691
Do not squander your talents.
Be brazen, be bold.

203
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,926
The world needs change and you're among
the few who can make that happen.

204
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,909
It's like getting a pep talk
from Einstein.

205
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,504
- You okay?
- I gotta finish my lab work.

206
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,474
- You're coming to the party tonight?
- I guess.

207
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,826
You're coming to the party tonight!

208
00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:00,011
Okay.

209
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:02,678
You don't want to make Tina mad,
you know how she gets.

210
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:06,918
I'll be there.

211
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:10,556
You know, sometimes I wonder
why we even try.

212
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:34,446
Wake up, sleepy head.

213
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,848
You're missing the party.

214
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,350
Sorry, but I think
I'm getting close to something.

215
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,187
The coefficient on the blood coagulants
is almost matching.

216
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,423
Hey! Get your ass up, we're late!

217
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:47,959
I think I should stay.

218
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,462
Kirk, can't it wait till tomorrow?

219
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,114
What good's life if you don't live it?

220
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,781
Put away the bat stats,
just for one night.

221
00:23:56,633 --> 00:24:00,004
- For me.
- For you.

222
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:02,707
Okay, that's enough convincing,
let's move, move, move!

223
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:04,841
Crazy Ivy's bringing her homegrown.

224
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:20,491
Are you sure this is our place?
The key doesn't fit.

225
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,426
Let me.

226
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:26,860
It looks like our place.

227
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,030
It smells like it.

228
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,303
- You okay?
- Yeah, I feel fine.

229
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:36,149
- I hope we didn't tire you out too much.
- Head's up!

230
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:39,375
The couch.

231
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:42,747
What do you mean?

232
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:46,150
Not tonight.
This designated driver is going home.

233
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,705
But, baby, I'm the designated boyfriend.
You need to drive me. Come on!

234
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:53,491
Oh, my God! This is your project, right?

235
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:57,396
- The nanites.
- Yeah, I brought it home.

236
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:02,514
Look how far they got
and they're still building it.

237
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:06,771
They replicate themselves.
Must be trillions by now.

238
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:09,207
If you had a microscope,
you could see them.

239
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,276
They'll all be part of the ship
when it's finished.

240
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:15,546
- What kind of metal?
- Iron, lead, little mercury.

241
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:17,866
Could you do this with organics?

242
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:21,369
Theoretically. What do you want
to build? A girlfriend?

243
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:22,854
I'm serious.

244
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,875
If you can program nanites this complex,
that could be the answer.

245
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,594
The bat venom almost eradicates
the lymphoma,

246
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,064
but the cell structure
breaks down even as it forms.

247
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,067
If we could program molecules
to secure the structure,

248
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,603
then we could stabilize the...

249
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,569
The...

250
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:46,074
He's okay. Too much excitement, I think.

251
00:25:48,378 --> 00:25:52,948
Hello? Yes, we need an ambulance.
We have a friend. He's sick.

252
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:57,505
You should have told us how bad it was.

253
00:25:57,605 --> 00:26:00,224
I didn't want to bore you
with the details.

254
00:26:00,374 --> 00:26:03,762
Seriously, Kirk, we're your friends.
We care about you.

255
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,464
You really are close.

256
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:10,501
I can't say that I understand it all, but
I see what you mean about using nanotech.

257
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:13,137
The medical solution
takes you only so far.

258
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:16,741
- You need an agent to patch it all in.
- Is that my research?

259
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,908
- Yeah.
- How'd you get my password?

260
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:22,480
Batman. Wasn't too hard.

261
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,582
You know, I wouldn't mind
taking a stab at this.

262
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:27,819
- You think it could work?
- Yeah, maybe.

263
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,523
I don't know, I mean...
How soon can you blow this pop stand?

264
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,191
Hand me my clothes.

265
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,160
You sure you're well enough?
I don't think he's well enough.

266
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,930
He's not going to get any better
lying on his ass.

267
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,998
Anyway school's over.
We could use a science project.

268
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:47,305
Mickey, Minnie and Mighty,
rest in peace.

269
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:50,739
A rodent nation salutes you.

270
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,229
But you, Jerry, look at you.

271
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:58,850
Five days and stronger than ever.
You're the mouse that scored.

272
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,487
His erythrocyte count is still up,
agglutination normal.

273
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:07,191
- I think you did it, Will.
- You laid the brick, I just plastered.

274
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:10,592
- We could still use another test.
- No.

275
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:13,916
You sure?

276
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:17,001
- What are you doing?
- I don't have time for any more tests.

277
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:19,837
If I go back to the hospital,
I'll lose this chance.

278
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:22,223
- Will!
- Kirk, I don't know.

279
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:26,141
We knew it was going to come down
to this. Just look away.

280
00:27:28,578 --> 00:27:31,112
Jesus, here.

281
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,686
You better survive this, you bastard.

282
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:52,703
- Vincent Price movie, five letters.
- How can you do a crossword?

283
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:55,370
I already did the Sudoku.

284
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:57,973
- How is he?
- The same.

285
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:01,345
I wonder if you'd take
such good care of me.

286
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:04,446
Oh, God, Will, don't start that again.

287
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,183
Kirk! Kirk, open up!

288
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:33,041
Where's your frickin' wallet, kid?

289
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:30,001
Three scientists dead.
All working for the President.

290
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,387
Must be pretty sensitive
if she sends in Steve Trevor.

291
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:34,940
These were important men, Lois.

292
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,892
The President wants to ensure
that there were no security breaches.

293
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:39,810
Then they were working for her.

294
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,981
- On what?
- I never said that.

295
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:45,183
<i>And would Mr. Trevor's investigation
include the Justice League?</i>

296
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,451
Why would you even ask?

297
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,686
I don't know if you've read
the crime reports, Pete,

298
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:52,788
but they have some nasty implications.
And yesterday, who do I run into?

299
00:29:58,762 --> 00:30:00,629
I'll call you back.

300
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:06,288
- We meet again.
- Mind if I come in?

301
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,230
By all means.

302
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:14,779
Popular place.

303
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,948
It's not often we get a strange visitor
from another planet.

304
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,717
What brings you?

305
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:23,888
The other day you asked me about
my interest in Silas Stone's death.

306
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:27,825
- The fact is he was working for me.
- On what?

307
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:31,028
Something in the tower.
I could show you if you'd like.

308
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:33,164
You never let the press
inside the tower.

309
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:37,001
I'm reconsidering, unless
you'd rather not be the first.

310
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,803
Like hell! Let's go.

311
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,239
I'll give you a lift.

312
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,989
Thanks, but I'll drive.

313
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,580
The generators are Kryptonian-designed.

314
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,949
They not only power the building,
but provide a shield

315
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:54,051
that makes it virtually impenetrable.

316
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:59,154
My God, even the rumors
about this place don't do it justice.

317
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:14,069
Here in the center of the tower
is the center of my life.

318
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,860
- The ship which brought me to Earth.
- The government used to have this.

319
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,248
It was never theirs to keep.
I asked for it back, they acquiesced.

320
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:27,552
- I'll bet they did.
- These are the ship's computer files.

321
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,638
What little we know about Krypton,
we know from them.

322
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:34,425
Unfortunately, the files were heavily
damaged during the ship's trek to Earth.

323
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,428
The government hasn't been able
to recover much and neither have I.

324
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:40,181
That's why I enlisted
Professor Stone's help,

325
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,767
to see if he could retrieve
the information.

326
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,901
Right now, all we have
are the last moments on Krypton.

327
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:01,535
- He looks like you.
- He's my biological father.

328
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:04,021
There's a DNA record. From his uniform,

329
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:08,259
we think he was a high-ranking official,
undoubtedly brilliant.

330
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,511
He must have known the end was coming.

331
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:13,497
I'd like to think if more people
had listened to him,

332
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:15,333
he could have been the planet's savior.

333
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:19,937
Is that how you see your role?
To save us? Or to rule us?

334
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:22,556
I thought we were getting
beyond the sarcasm.

335
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:25,776
Come on, Superman,
we both know what's going on here.

336
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:27,979
This is straight up spin control!

337
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,283
Certain police reports are coming out that
are gonna make people wonder about you.

338
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:37,438
So here I am getting the full court press
on the man of steel's human side,

339
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,807
if that's not an oxymoron.

340
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:42,774
I wanted to reveal my world
to you, Ms. Lane.

341
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:44,899
Really?

342
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:49,467
Wasn't Luthor the one who extracted
this footage? He never seemed impressed.

343
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,503
Luthor was a frustrated elitist
whose influence was waning.

344
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,138
I come from a simple people, Ms. Lane.

345
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:57,475
I was raised by a migrant couple.
I've seen the harshness of life.

346
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:01,245
If I deliver justice with a heavy hand,
it's because I've been on the receiving end.

347
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:04,432
But I'm here when my country needs me.
And where's Lex Luthor?

348
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:06,263
Gone! Absent!

349
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:09,420
Excuse me.

350
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,554
Sorry to interrupt, but there's a call.

351
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:23,401
- You actually brought her.
- What a bitch.

352
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:26,670
<i>Needless to say, this is
a conversation we never had,</i>

353
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,438
<i>but I want you to know that forensics
is further implicating the Justice League</i>

354
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:33,661
- <i>in these murders.</i>
- What forensics exactly?

355
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,080
<i>It's serious enough
that I'm making this call.</i>

356
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,849
<i>It might behoove you if the League
volunteered on their own</i>

357
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:40,451
<i>to speak to the authorities.</i>

358
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,854
I am speaking to the authorities.
I am speaking to you!

359
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:47,892
<i>Don't get heated with me, Superman!
I'm only trying to lessen the pressure.</i>

360
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:51,529
<i>If things get difficult,
I won't be able to protect you!</i>

361
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:57,064
Protect me from who?
Who do you think protects whom here?

362
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:06,160
- Hello, Batman.
- Hello, Tin.

363
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,095
Is Professor Magnus available?

364
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:10,331
What the hell's wrong with you?

365
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:13,167
He's... busy.

366
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:16,220
They are all a bunch
of cold-blooded killers!

367
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,505
Not Kirk!

368
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:20,324
He's a freaking vampire,
for Christ's sakes!

369
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:23,494
He only kills criminals.
You're off base.

370
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:27,665
Just because you're best buddies
doesn't mean you're safe! None of us are!

371
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,568
If Fries and the others
are on their list, we all are!

372
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:34,235
And I'm not just gonna sit around
and wait to see who's next!

373
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:43,612
- You dropped by at an opportune time.
- Dr. Karen Beecher?

374
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,052
Yeah. 200 IQ. Emotional IQ, not so high.

375
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:52,523
- Where did she put that pipe?
- What's the list she mentioned?

376
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,191
She's under the impression
that the Justice League

377
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,894
is killing off America's
greatest scientists.

378
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:01,011
I informed her that was nonsense.
I hope I was right.

379
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:05,267
- What's her reason?
- She's a scientist, she sees patterns.

380
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:07,418
What aren't you telling me, Will?

381
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:12,176
Come on, Kirk, you know the deal.
You get hired, sign papers, keep secrets.

382
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:17,045
But if I thought there was anything
you should know, I wouldn't hold back.

383
00:35:17,914 --> 00:35:20,015
What about project Fair Play?

384
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:23,003
How do you know about that?

385
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:25,489
There was an e-mail
in Silas Stone's files.

386
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:29,560
You're CCed. It appears to be
a program Luthor started.

387
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,529
What does it have to do with this?

388
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:36,932
Nothing, Kirk. Really.
If I knew, I would tell you. I would.

389
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,978
- Kirk. What's going on?
- That's what I'd like to know.

390
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,648
- Your husband isn't much help.
- You know how Will is.

391
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:54,550
So sure of himself. He can be
too clever for his own good.

392
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:57,221
I'm afraid.

393
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:02,193
Don't worry, I won't let anything
happen to you. Or Will.

394
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,993
- You either, Tin.
- Thank you, Batman.

395
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:09,467
I'm worried about you too, Kirk.
I read the news.

396
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,547
I worry you're in as much danger
as any of us.

397
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:17,439
I know the skin is cold,
but the heart's still warm.

398
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:37,762
Looks like you could use a partner.

399
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,697
I thought you'd grown tired of me.

400
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,496
Not tired.

401
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:45,099
Just restless.

402
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:49,607
You don't fool me, Bekka.
I know why you're here.

403
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,108
Which is?

404
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,775
You want to know what forensics has.

405
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,745
I can't tell you.

406
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:02,082
How about a wager?

407
00:37:02,182 --> 00:37:06,239
I win, I get the information. You win...

408
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:08,689
you get me.

409
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,995
We both know you're fifty times
stronger than I am.

410
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:21,772
Maybe we can both get what we want.

411
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:25,941
- You think the big guy's gonna like that?
- I told you, he's not my boyfriend.

412
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,745
I belong to no man.
Not Superman, not you!

413
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:38,453
You belonged to someone once.

414
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:47,765
I told you that in a moment
of weakness. Bring it up again...

415
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,571
All right, all right.

416
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,709
Ray Palmer's body was found
slashed in half.

417
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:05,880
They're pretty sure
they've ID'ed the weapon.

418
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:17,127
For too long, Darkseid,
our worlds have been at war.

419
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:19,997
And now for the first time
in a millennium,

420
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:22,332
we can lower our swords.

421
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:27,304
Here's to our treaty and the union
which will seal our bond.

422
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:30,874
The marriage between
my lovely granddaughter Bekka

423
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:34,144
and your steadfast son Orion.

424
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:39,149
In that same spirit, I welcome you
to Apokolips, Highfather.

425
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:45,019
Tomorrow, at this time, we not only
merge kingdoms, but families.

426
00:38:49,592 --> 00:38:52,863
It's a world of heathens
and brutes, my child.

427
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:57,000
History will praise
your courage and sacrifice.

428
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,037
The boy seems different,
not like his family.

429
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:03,741
More thoughtful. He made me uneasy.

430
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:08,011
This is not the time to waver.
You have a world counting on you.

431
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:09,736
Yes, I know.

432
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:13,016
Then get some sleep.

433
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:16,384
We have a momentous day ahead of us.

434
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:38,208
What are you doing here?

435
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:41,044
- I wanted to see you.
- You're not supposed to.

436
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:43,413
You're going to find out
I'm not much for rules.

437
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:46,016
I also tend to get my way.

438
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:48,719
- Hop on.
- No, thank you.

439
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,556
They told me you were a spitfire.
You're not afraid, are you?

440
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:56,427
- I'm never afraid.
- Then come with me.

441
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:59,994
I have something I want to show you.

442
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:07,436
- Better hold tighter than that.
- This is tight enough...

443
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:43,173
I never knew Apokolips
could hold such beauty.

444
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:45,609
This is my special spot.

445
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:50,013
The one place in my world where the sky
is open and you can see the stars.

446
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:52,783
- This is where I come to think.
- About what?

447
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:57,517
Life, honor, you.

448
00:40:57,954 --> 00:41:00,791
You and I are the only hope
for our worlds, Bekka.

449
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:04,025
But there will be treachery everywhere
and we must be prepared.

450
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:09,487
It's for you. Open it.

451
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:14,538
It's beautiful.

452
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,357
The blade was forged
by our finest swordsmith.

453
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:21,662
It's virtually indestructible.
But that's not the most impressive part.

454
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:24,214
Inside the pommel is a mother box.

455
00:41:24,314 --> 00:41:27,648
It will take you anywhere
you want to go.

456
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:33,707
It is my wedding gift.
Keep it at your side, always.

457
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:36,874
The sword will protect you
when I cannot.

458
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:57,514
By sacred powers invoked
from beyond the source wall,

459
00:41:57,614 --> 00:42:01,882
I now declare your spirits as one.

460
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,809
Come, let's go.

461
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:33,614
- Bekka!
- It's over. We can be together.

462
00:42:43,993 --> 00:42:47,328
- No!
- It can't be stopped!

463
00:43:10,753 --> 00:43:13,313
You should have gone with her, boy.

464
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:32,442
You said he could live.

465
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:36,980
I said I would spare him for you,
but not at the expense of the mission.

466
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,851
Even if he had lived, what life
could you have had with him?

467
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,021
- He was different.
- He was Darkseid's blood,

468
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:49,122
one of countless bastards
in a line of endless betrayal.

469
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,297
You are one to speak!
You are blood-soaked in betrayal!

470
00:43:54,397 --> 00:43:55,866
Watch your tongue, granddaughter!

471
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,635
If I had to do it over,
I would have warned them all.

472
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:00,770
I would have shouted to the skies,

473
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,041
"Trust not the monster Highfather.
He is mad with power!"

474
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,306
Silence!

475
00:44:09,145 --> 00:44:12,179
You can still redeem yourself.

476
00:44:12,915 --> 00:44:15,750
There is no redemption for me.

477
00:44:35,538 --> 00:44:39,043
<i>According to my sources,
the forensic evidence is unassailable.</i>

478
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,012
<i>Fang marks in Victor Fries' neck.</i>

479
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:47,451
<i>Slice impressions on Ray Palmer and the
truck matching Wonder Woman's sword.</i>

480
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:52,122
<i>Superman's fingerprints embedded in steel
at the scene of the Stones' murders.</i>

481
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:56,243
<i>Damning evidence for sure. And what
does the White House have to say?</i>

482
00:44:56,343 --> 00:44:58,421
<i>It would be inappropriate
for the administration</i>

483
00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:00,806
<i>to comment on an ongoing investigation.</i>

484
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:04,585
<i>I will remind everyone, the police have yet
to find any motives for these killings.</i>

485
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:06,937
<i>Has the President been
in contact with the League?</i>

486
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:11,408
<i>No. She expects them to fully cooperate
with the authorities, like any good citizen.</i>

487
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:14,341
<i>No one is above the law.</i>

488
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,716
Where are you?
The whole world's coming down.

489
00:45:19,816 --> 00:45:22,279
I'll be there as soon as I can.

490
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,798
The only mystery is why
the rest of us are still alive.

491
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:38,502
The League doesn't want to expose
themselves further. They've been sloppy.

492
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,004
We don't know they're behind this.

493
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:44,141
They want us to know.
Maybe that's their game.

494
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,309
Maybe they're warning us
to stop the project.

495
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:50,580
- Fair Play is already done, Sivana.
- I was only there at the beginning.

496
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,284
For Christ's sakes, Holt, you named
the damn thing. You got half of us hired!

497
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,753
It wasn't me. It was Luthor.

498
00:45:56,853 --> 00:45:59,489
And where is he? Does he even
know what's happening?

499
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:02,826
- Is he even alive?
- Maybe we should go public.

500
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:06,897
If everyone knows, it'll take the heat
off us. It'll be in the government's lap.

501
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:11,832
- Yeah, let's make them mad at us, too.
- It's not as if they're protecting us.

502
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,236
Run!

503
00:47:40,388 --> 00:47:42,156
Tina!

504
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:08,559
Who are you?

505
00:48:15,774 --> 00:48:18,684
No, no, no, no.

506
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:26,483
Everyone's dead.

507
00:48:26,952 --> 00:48:29,353
No, I hear a heartbeat.

508
00:48:35,294 --> 00:48:39,949
I should have called you when I got there.
How am I gonna tell him about Tina?

509
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:42,385
Who's to say he'll ever hear it?

510
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:45,522
- You still have no idea?
- Never saw anything like them.

511
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,758
They were using boom tubes.
Had to come from your world.

512
00:48:48,858 --> 00:48:50,027
Not necessarily.

513
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:54,164
Ever since she got here, the government's
being trying to replicate the boom tubes.

514
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,401
Magnus told me. Maybe someone succeeded.

515
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:58,969
So now what?

516
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:03,440
We got a house full of dead scientists
and we're no closer to solving this thing.

517
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,542
There is someone who could help,

518
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:08,003
but you're not gonna like it.

519
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:51,654
<i>Project Fair Play.</i>

520
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:57,591
<i>I began it years ago in case the human race
needed to neutralize the Justice League.</i>

521
00:49:59,695 --> 00:50:04,097
<i>In other words, Superman,
in case we had to kill you.</i>

522
00:50:09,037 --> 00:50:11,708
I apologize for my bluntness.

523
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:15,745
Let's face it, the Justice League
may be a three-headed hydra,

524
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:18,581
but there's only one head
that truly counts.

525
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:22,168
It's no surprise.
You've hated me from day one.

526
00:50:22,268 --> 00:50:24,521
I hated what you embody.

527
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,891
Unassailable power's
never to be trusted.

528
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:31,094
Look at the way the government
uses you and you them,

529
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,097
while the world walks on egg shells.

530
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,200
Eventually, you would have had
to come to blows with Washington.

531
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,003
The wonder is that it took this long.

532
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,805
It's only happening
because someone means it to.

533
00:50:42,905 --> 00:50:44,891
If you're pulling the strings, Luthor...

534
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:49,379
Again, you misread me.
I never really cared for power.

535
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:53,547
I walked away from it.
What I coveted was knowledge.

536
00:50:58,153 --> 00:51:02,892
I'm mapping the universe,
revealing all its glorious mysteries.

537
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:06,262
And in a way,
I have you to thank for it.

538
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:10,400
- What do you mean?
- I suppose you can know now.

539
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,171
Most of this is based
on Kryptonian science,

540
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:18,007
which I downloaded from the ship
that brought you to Earth.

541
00:51:18,107 --> 00:51:22,645
- Those files were damaged.
- No. We gave you fake copies.

542
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:27,183
It was my idea. You were powerful enough
without having that knowledge.

543
00:51:27,283 --> 00:51:31,819
You bastard. You had no right.
Those files are mine! They're my legacy!

544
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:37,024
Yes, they are.
Would you like to see your legacy?

545
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:44,315
His name was Jor-El,

546
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:48,137
the leading scientist
on the planet Krypton.

547
00:51:48,237 --> 00:51:52,072
The woman is his wife, Lara,
your mother.

548
00:51:57,713 --> 00:52:00,347
And here comes Dad.

549
00:52:00,716 --> 00:52:02,483
General Zod,

550
00:52:03,151 --> 00:52:06,389
a ruthless commander,
who was taking over the planet.

551
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:10,159
He drilled into Krypton's core
to power his military machine.

552
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:14,131
A fatal mistake,
but he would not die completely.

553
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:18,401
It's not everyone who can witness
their own conception.

554
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:22,302
A planet dies and you were born.

555
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:26,092
Why did you keep this from me?

556
00:52:26,192 --> 00:52:28,978
I was afraid you'd emulate your father.

557
00:52:29,078 --> 00:52:31,481
Better you should think he was a hero.

558
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,251
But you're no hero, not really.

559
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,153
You're just a pit bull.

560
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:40,423
I want those files.

561
00:52:40,523 --> 00:52:44,461
The originals are with Waller.
Maybe you could negotiate a deal,

562
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,664
or take them by force,
that tends to be your method.

563
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:51,501
But I'd be careful.
Project Fair Play worked.

564
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,568
They can kill you now if they want.

565
00:53:02,644 --> 00:53:05,248
<i>You should have been straight
with me, Luthor.</i>

566
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,066
<i>Things could have been different.</i>

567
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:12,101
<i>In some ways, I'm as much
your creation as my father's.</i>

568
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:30,256
NASA confirmed it, Madam President.

569
00:53:30,356 --> 00:53:34,110
<i>Luthor's ship was destroyed
and his last visitor was Superman.</i>

570
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,747
- Then they've killed them all.
- <i>What do we do?</i>

571
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:41,515
We start Fair Play. Evacuate Metropolis.

572
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:49,256
Keep it moving! Keep it moving!

573
00:53:56,832 --> 00:53:58,668
We could give ourselves up.

574
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:02,572
Get a lawyer, or we can beat
the hell out of them.

575
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,574
Someone out there is playing us

576
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:07,475
and we're not gonna find him
in police custody.

577
00:54:19,748 --> 00:54:23,192
- Gonna be a hell of a webcast.
- If we live through it.

578
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:25,159
Lois, it's Olsen!

579
00:54:27,062 --> 00:54:30,900
Yeah, I'm in the morgue
with all the dead scientists.

580
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,522
I'll send you some video.

581
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,704
How'd you get in here? Get him out!

582
00:54:45,947 --> 00:54:48,551
What happened to this body?
It was here a minute ago.

583
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:51,165
Don't look at me. I didn't take it.

584
00:55:05,734 --> 00:55:08,639
Do you realize it's been ten years
since I met you?

585
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,808
I was on the run, everyone after me.

586
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,711
And then you found me,
down at the docks,

587
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:18,648
middle of the night, a rat in my mouth.

588
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:22,719
- Why you took me in, I'll never know.
- You were hungry.

589
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,522
<i>Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,</i>

590
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:29,525
<i>by the authority granted me
by the President of the United States,</i>

591
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:32,362
<i>I call upon you to give yourselves up.</i>

592
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:36,033
Someone once asked if I wanted
to save the world or rule it.

593
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,936
Today, it's going to be hard
to tell the difference.

594
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:43,173
When I get out there, keep the shields up.
No one gets to Magnus.

595
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:47,360
- I'm going with him.
- If they can kill him, they can kill you.

596
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:51,579
I've been here before. This time,
they're gonna have to kill me.

597
00:56:31,586 --> 00:56:34,192
Oh, my God. Tina.

598
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:02,485
If you are under the impression
that we're surrendering,

599
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,937
let me relieve you of that notion.

600
00:57:05,037 --> 00:57:08,374
We have a witness to our innocence
recovering inside.

601
00:57:08,474 --> 00:57:10,326
We know you have Dr. Magnus.

602
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,795
We can assure you
he'll get the best of care.

603
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:14,731
You'll see him when I say.

604
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:17,330
Not this time, buddy.

605
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:56,706
The lasers mimic a red sun's radiation,

606
00:57:57,506 --> 00:57:59,208
like Krypton's sun.

607
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:02,578
- You're looking better.
- Organic nanites.

608
00:58:02,678 --> 00:58:06,181
Platinum brought them,
with a change of clothes.

609
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:07,434
Where is Tina?

610
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:15,091
She's dead. I killed her,
about a year into our marriage.

611
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:18,060
It was an accident, I assure you.

612
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,529
You see, I always knew she loved you.

613
00:58:20,629 --> 00:58:24,734
Even back in college, she was only really
happy when the three of us were together.

614
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:29,205
Even after I turned you into a monster,
even after that, she still wanted you.

615
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:33,176
She married me,
but that was an obligation.

616
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:37,380
She kept urging me to find a cure
for you, every day, night and day.

617
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,516
"Will, you've got to do something.
Will, you can't abandon him!

618
00:58:40,616 --> 00:58:43,219
"Will, Will, Will!" She never let up!

619
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:47,187
And finally one day,
I'd had it and I hit her!

620
00:58:48,523 --> 00:58:51,192
And her head struck a table.

621
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:52,996
She was gone.

622
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:55,732
That's when I came up with her twin.

623
00:58:56,032 --> 00:59:00,434
She's made from a platinum isotope
that can mimic human flesh.

624
00:59:03,238 --> 00:59:04,507
What are you doing, Will?

625
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:08,245
When I killed Tina,
I had a revelation, Kirk.

626
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,614
If I, the best and brightest of men,

627
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:16,219
were capable of such a monstrous act,
then what hope is there for humanity?

628
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,622
Such horrors would never cease.

629
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:24,527
But what if I could change it all?
Change the world, like Luthor said.

630
00:59:25,077 --> 00:59:29,365
What if I could link all minds as one?
No more personal anguish.

631
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,401
No more hatred. No more guilt.

632
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:35,235
And this is the instrument
of your benevolence?

633
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:37,371
A nanite bomb.

634
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:42,117
When it's set off, it will project over
seven billion microscopic boom tubes

635
00:59:42,217 --> 00:59:43,343
around the world.

636
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,682
<i>Each tube will plant a nanite
into someone's head.</i>

637
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:50,487
<i>In that instant, everyone will be
connected as one.</i>

638
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:52,922
Even the Justice League.

639
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:56,126
So why haven't you done this already?

640
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,860
I needed an energy source
strong enough to power it.

641
01:00:05,467 --> 01:00:06,726
I needed that.

642
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:14,810
At ease, my friend.

643
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:19,451
When I'm done, your personal
suffering will end as well.

644
01:01:22,644 --> 01:01:24,278
I'll get us out.

645
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:27,333
By the gods!

646
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,785
We've neutralized your mother box,
Wonder Woman.

647
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:32,752
Step aside, and I'll let you live.

648
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:40,527
All right, sweetheart, have it your way.

649
01:01:54,926 --> 01:01:56,479
I thought he was dead.

650
01:01:56,779 --> 01:02:00,349
I teleported from my ship
before the metal man destroyed it.

651
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:04,053
Unfortunately, I can't teleport
through those walls.

652
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:05,422
Luthor, move!

653
01:02:06,088 --> 01:02:08,724
Trevor, you ass! Listen to me.

654
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:11,460
I've been monitoring the tower.
It's Magnus!

655
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:14,730
He's the one! If we don't stop him,
he's going to take our minds.

656
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:17,314
And I, for one, would like to keep mine.

657
01:02:30,845 --> 01:02:33,867
- We're wired.
- Activate the ship's core.

658
01:02:45,093 --> 01:02:47,964
Not even the boom tubes
get through. What now?

659
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:51,650
I watched one mad man
destroy my home world.

660
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:54,184
I'm not going
to let another harm this one.

661
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:53,292
Get out of my house.

662
01:05:20,014 --> 01:05:21,781
It's over, Will.

663
01:05:22,483 --> 01:05:24,250
Not yet.

664
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,421
I've made a fairly strong recovery.

665
01:06:01,005 --> 01:06:05,858
I just burned all your mother boxes.
No more disappearing acts for you.

666
01:07:26,574 --> 01:07:28,978
If only she hadn't wanted you.

667
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:33,081
You, who only loved your bats
and test tubes!

668
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:37,216
Wrong. I loved two people in my life.

669
01:07:37,985 --> 01:07:40,820
And now they're both gone.

670
01:08:09,984 --> 01:08:11,851
Fry, bitch!

671
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:33,267
Go ahead.

672
01:08:36,911 --> 01:08:39,078
Bet you taste like crap.

673
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:47,137
You'll never make it.

674
01:08:54,562 --> 01:08:57,196
Low-tech, works for me.

675
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,134
The ship's core is destabilizing.

676
01:09:23,525 --> 01:09:27,729
It's funny how things
can change so quickly.

677
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:31,131
After a while, you don't even
recognize yourself anymore.

678
01:09:37,672 --> 01:09:38,898
Forgive me, Kirk.

679
01:09:55,156 --> 01:09:58,093
<i>Though it's been a week since
the showdown with Magnus' robots,</i>

680
01:09:58,193 --> 01:09:59,895
<i>the cleanup still goes on.</i>

681
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:03,465
<i>As the city readjusts,
so does this reporter.</i>

682
01:10:03,565 --> 01:10:07,335
<i>For a long time, I've thought
of the Justice League as inhuman.</i>

683
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:10,872
<i>But when they saved us
at a terrible risk to themselves,</i>

684
01:10:10,972 --> 01:10:14,176
<i>I just thank heaven
they were here to protect us.</i>

685
01:10:14,526 --> 01:10:17,793
Next, she'll be sending you selfies.

686
01:10:18,045 --> 01:10:21,884
I've been thinking, Kirk,
we need to shake things up a bit.

687
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:25,785
Change the way we do things.
No more politics. No more killing.

688
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:28,724
Seriously?

689
01:10:29,324 --> 01:10:31,935
Something to think about.

690
01:10:34,328 --> 01:10:36,477
It's time already?

691
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,219
What's going on?

692
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:44,123
- Our beautiful Bekka is leaving us.
- Why?

693
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,343
The problems of my past
linger in ways yours do not.

694
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,911
It's time I went back and faced them.

695
01:10:50,011 --> 01:10:52,946
- By yourself?
- She has a co-conspirator.

696
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:57,453
Are you ready, my dear?

697
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,705
They decided a few days ago.

698
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,791
I've grown bored
with this universe, Batman.

699
01:11:03,191 --> 01:11:05,018
Time to explore others.

700
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:10,634
- I hope you understand.
- I do, though it doesn't mean I like it.

701
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:12,932
You come to me if you need help.

702
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:18,572
I have something for you too, Superman.

703
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:26,114
The original files from your ship.

704
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:28,283
Aren't they supposed to be
with the government?

705
01:11:28,383 --> 01:11:31,987
You know how things get lost
in bureaucracies.

706
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:36,252
You'll find that Kryptonian science
has dramatic applications for Earth...

707
01:11:36,352 --> 01:11:39,678
in medicine, engineering, physics.

708
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:42,200
Be a real hero.

709
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:46,172
Thanks, Lex.

710
01:11:46,734 --> 01:11:50,736
- Shall we?
- Please, allow me.

711
01:12:07,421 --> 01:12:11,927
Looks like it's gonna be just
the two of us. Should I order out?

712
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:13,899
Why don't we get started?

713
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:18,097
I could use a science project.

714
01:12:18,866 --> 01:12:22,637
Time to look ahead, Kirk.
You know what they say.

715
01:12:22,737 --> 01:12:25,771
The past is like another planet.

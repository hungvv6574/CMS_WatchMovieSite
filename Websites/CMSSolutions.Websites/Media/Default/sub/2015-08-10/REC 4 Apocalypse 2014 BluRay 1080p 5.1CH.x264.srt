1
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:16,385
Apparently, a building was due to an unknown infectious disease

2
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,424
precaution sealed off.

3
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:22,562
Among those that are included in the building,

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,099
Nearby residents, police, firefighters

5
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,565
and two employees of a broadcasting company ...

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,315
... Concrete information on the pathogen.

7
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:37,486
Neither the minister nor the experts were able to present ...

8
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,906
... There could be only one survivor,

9
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:45,043
when there is a TV reporter ...

10
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:49,172
... The streets around the building are locked spacious.

11
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:55,338
As just confirmed the military has brought the situation under control.

12
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,005
The air is clean.

13
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,765
Understood. Back before.

14
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,847
Here long.

15
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,285
Guzmán, Lucas. In the third floor.

16
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,495
Give me cover.

17
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,751
In here.

18
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,379
All right.

19
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,796
Second floor, fixed charge.

20
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,168
Los upwards.

21
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,184
Lucas.

22
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,102
Lucas! Mist.

23
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,155
Lucas, where were you, damn it?

24
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,194
- Completed. - All charges attached.

25
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,161
- Got it. 
- Get out of here.

26
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,994
- What was that? - Shit, shit, shit.

27
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:09,332
The blast in four minutes.

28
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,961
Get out of here.

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,048
Get out of here, folks. All man out of here!

30
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,679
What's up?

31
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,185
Are you okay? Do you get air?

32
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,104
Get out of here, now!

33
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,858
Shit!

34
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,534
I have no more ammo!

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,168
- Shoot! Shoot! - Apart!

36
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,175
Shit!

37
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,687
You're the doctor.

38
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,145
You can help me.

39
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,319
Blowing up in three minutes.

40
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,826
As are the rules.

41
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,215
Come on. Come on. Come on!

42
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,094
We have to get out of here.

43
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,263
Help, I'm here!

44
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,391
- We have to get. - No way!

45
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,643
We have no time.

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,528
- Go before I do that. - You're crazy.

47
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,691
Get me out of here, please.

48
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,200
Damn.

49
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,640
Everything's fine. Do not panic.

50
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,059
I am doing you do not.

51
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,316
Blowing up in a minute.

52
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,358
Look at me. I'll take you out of here.

53
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,402
Hallo, Angela.

54
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,655
Only the rest.

55
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,325
The prevent you from hurting yourself.

56
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,414
So it is good.

57
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,547
Do you remember anything?

58
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,466
No.

59
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,970
Hold still.

60
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,559
No.

61
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,848
Not.

62
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,607
It's almost over.

63
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,279
Where am I?

64
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,866
We ensure that you lack nothing.

65
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,915
Good night.

66
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,534
Sorry.

67
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,370
You may know where the wedding is?

68
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,158
Apparently I had a drink too much,

69
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:44,750
and my daughter took me to the room.

70
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,836
Because I must have fallen asleep.

71
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,001
I do not know what you're talking about.

72
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,845
I do not know where I am.

73
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,090
My mind is playing tricks on me well.

74
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,181
So, I do not know where we are.

75
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,309
- This'll be fun. - Have you seen anyone else?

76
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,483
Okay, we do the following.

77
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,401
I'll find out where we are. Wait so long here.

78
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,694
- Equal someone will pick you up. - Is good.

79
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,744
If you see my daughter, tell her,

80
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,328
I'm here.

81
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,084
Yes, I tell her.

82
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,937
How is she?

83
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,274
She is alert and has quite caught.

84
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:56,276
We only lose time. She is healthy. There is no reason for suspicion.

85
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,698
She was more than six hours in there.

86
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,202
We need to be sure.

87
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,428
That hurts me.

88
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,021
That's okay, I loose something.

89
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,451
Stay here!

90
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,171
Shit. Watch Out!

91
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,215
The patient escapes.

92
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,677
Seize them, if need be by force.

93
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,016
- How long? - Two minutes.

94
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,776
- It runs upwards. - Do not move!

95
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,664
Come on, faster!

96
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,706
She runs to the dining room.

97
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,713
Hold it!

98
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,433
Run! Run! Come on, walk on!

99
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,348
Run! Run!

100
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,520
Hold it.

101
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,026
- You? - Apart.

102
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,775
- We have them. - Have you not heard?

103
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,652
- Help me. - I said, "apart."

104
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,578
- Me. - Do not move!

105
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,996
Shit!

106
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,289
Come on, quickly.

107
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,004
Come on, come on.

108
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,344
Hold it! Hands up, no movement.

109
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,972
Hold it. Do not move!

110
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,770
- We have them and wait for orders. - Where are we?

111
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,478
Take down their arms. The test says it is clean.

112
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,314
- Who are you? - Take her to her cabin.

113
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,777
- You should rest. - No.

114
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,864
Do not worry, we will not bind. I promise.

115
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,333
I want to know who you are.

116
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,214
I regret the incident.

117
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,378
- I'm Dr. Ricarte. - I want to speak my superiors.

118
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,720
You sent here.

119
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,683
And my partner?

120
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,478
I assume you mean the Corporal Lucas.

121
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:20,321
We had to examine it. Just routine. He is soon to you.

122
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,657
Why are we here? That was not part of the operation.

123
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,778
We provide complete isolation here.

124
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,373
What for? Us nothing is missing. They examined me.

125
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,204
The situation is more complicated than you think.

126
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,748
There was another case in Barcelona.

127
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:43,924
We were able to bring it under control, but an error would be fatal.

128
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,298
Let me guess: a wedding.

129
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,515
There was only one survivor. I see that you already know it.

130
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,476
Hey, new passengers?

131
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,227
That's wonderful.

132
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,851
Excuse me.

133
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:03,113
Our captain Ortega happy to show you his ship safely.

134
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,653
Captain.

135
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,037
You probably came with the last group on board.

136
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,198
Seems that way. My name Guzmán.

137
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,915
I carry you around.

138
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,390
- Then you have the say here? - Saying, those who pay.

139
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,610
And the doctors pay enough so that I can sit down to rest.

140
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,396
40 years on the sea enough for me.

141
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:48,659
After this I will return home. It is time.

142
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,490
The doctors call the shots?

143
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,748
Yes, and they have brought along their own army.

144
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,000
I think you already know.

145
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,717
What is the status?

146
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,134
28 knots. Paying wind from the northeast.

147
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,145
We will meet soon to a low pressure area.

148
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,354
All right. Ahead with the least power. With luck, it warps before.

149
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,859
Of course, we have no hurry.

150
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,114
Gorostiaga ship's officer. From Bilbao. A great guy.

151
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,071
Pilot, which is simpler. And call me Goro.

152
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,156
This does not look good.

153
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,248
That one? Tell the venerable soldier. The were.

154
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,828
Do you have something done on it?

155
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,169
You should disinfect it.

156
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:45,083
Look at him, he's a doctor. Experts for Infectious Diseases and such.

157
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,379
Again.

158
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,301
This boat is too old for such jaunts.

159
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,262
No, he is not too old.

160
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,805
The generator is overloaded by all the medical equipment.

161
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,351
What's up?

162
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,269
We have brownouts, since we have expired.

163
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,778
At night, the current drops even completely.

164
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,066
The build down there a kind of laboratory or so.

165
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:14,613
- What medical equipment? - As I said, it does not concern us.

166
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,217
Sorry.

167
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,588
I did not want to disturb you, but ...

168
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,140
Do I know you?

169
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:40,221
No. With so many people, I'm all messed up.

170
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:46,356
But you are one of my grandchildren or to the bride?

171
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,152
You probably had a drink too much.

172
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,121
But do not worry, dear, me too.

173
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,857
Nick. Nick!

174
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,311
What are you doing?

175
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,688
Nothing.

176
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,651
Nick is the radio operator, even if it looks different.

177
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,615
Well, there is not much to do.

178
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:42,328
They have the frequencies encrypted, and only they have the codes.

179
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:48,293
- We have no contact to the outside? - Not even lifeboats treat us.

180
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,125
This has probably told you no.

181
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,549
Even the drainage system has been shut down.

182
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,296
They insisted.

183
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:00,559
Yes, as they called it? Security log.

184
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,937
- Is that understood? - How far have you got with the camera?

185
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,391
I'm working on it, but it takes.

186
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,903
The camera still works, but the hard drive has copped it.

187
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,615
I need to get out each frame individually. A Friemelei.

188
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,574
Nick is also our computer or whatever you call it.

189
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,206
The doctors want him to restore the video.

190
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,083
They are interested greatly.

191
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,746
I found them at the reporter.

192
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,750
That does not exist. You have Ángela Vidal saved?

193
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,010
So what in the way.

194
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,719
- If you knew how happy he is. - I am a huge fan of her.

195
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,179
I do not miss any of their programs.

196
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,723
And now they visit you personally.

197
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,309
So it looks.

198
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:53,191
If you have saved them, then you probably know them well.

199
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:58,200
Well, at least a little. Enough to imagine.

200
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,198
Yes of course.

201
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,075
Very good.

202
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,708
How do you find our Filipino DJ?

203
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,827
There was probably nothing better.

204
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,669
This is the signal for food. You get used to it already.

205
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,392
Here speaks the deep sea. What's up?

206
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,102
Everything okay down there?

207
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,314
- It's worse than I thought.
 - crap.

208
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,900
You will need patience up there.

209
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,406
So, we have enough time.

210
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,319
Come for dinner. Then you go on.

211
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,657
Yeah, it's probably better.

212
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,378
Here you are.

213
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,124
What else is not.

214
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,921
You know ...

215
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,634
I eat at night is not much.

216
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,471
I've had enough a glass of warm milk.

217
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,686
I see.

218
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,023
Are you a glass of milk for the Lady?

219
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,520
- Milk? - And some cookies when it comes.

220
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,900
Maybe you have a little meat or at least sauce.

221
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:27,202
Hey. The bracelet does not mean that you're on a cruise ship.

222
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,536
Take it easy.

223
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,000
Where have you been?

224
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,000
- The same can I ask you. - Yes.

225
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,838
- Do you know what my family? - No.

226
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,973
I understand that the wedding has to be modern,

227
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,563
but this is too much of a good thing.

228
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,145
- Milk and cookies. - Toll.

229
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,984
Thanks, that's very sweet.

230
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,192
Over there, there is sugar.

231
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,159
Oh, yeah? A little bit will not hurt me.

232
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:14,962
She is totally confused and does not know where she is.

233
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,169
- Someone has to talk to her. - Oh yeah?

234
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,260
What do we say? That her family is dead?

235
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,933
I was just at the captain.

236
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:33,271
They had to cut the lifeboats, and the radio traffic is stopped.

237
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,057
- What? - That's right.

238
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,604
You have set up a laboratory.

239
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,237
There was no mention of preventive quarantine?

240
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,443
A laboratory?

241
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,319
They conceal what us. What are all the soldiers?

242
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,080
Have you seen the cameras?

243
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:56,291
They are everywhere. Even while peeing they film you.

244
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,790
That makes me mad.

245
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,628
Maybe it's not so bad.

246
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,897
Seems to have worked. Good work.

247
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,273
You could be good for Naval Intelligence. I have ...

248
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,783
- Seriously? - Well, you never know.

249
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,035
Marinegeheimdienst, wow.

250
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:35,250
Will you actually from here in the surveillance cameras inside?

251
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,171
- Who do you think I am? - You've seen earlier ...

252
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:43,880
That was my first act. So I pass the time.

253
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,840
As I have discovered that?

254
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,096
Madness.

255
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,633
- You they ask me before, right? - Of course.

256
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,223
And the lab?

257
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:03,312
The door opens with a numerical code. Visitors are as undesirable.

258
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:07,111
They weigh in safety, but do not know me.

259
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,861
There it is.

260
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,000
- What are they doing in there? - Definitely not good.

261
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,537
I have seen how they have invited cages.

262
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,546
What should be the well?

263
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,420
Cages.

264
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,263
And what's behind that door?

265
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,220
No idea. Since there is no cameras.

266
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,471
Closer I get to not ran.

267
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,105
200%. Not bad, eh?

268
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,403
No, not bad.

269
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,900
Goes with all cameras?

270
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,785
What are you like?

271
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,651
Please not now.

272
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,646
It happened again.

273
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,619
Comes.

274
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,628
Hey!

275
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,463
What is?

276
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:22,102
So, I do not know what are you doing down here,

277
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,601
but that would have long since work again.

278
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,646
Oh, yeah? Well, if you say so.

279
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,985
He wants to fuck us.

280
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:36,275
It may be that their negroes there, where you come from, everything look relaxed.

281
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,909
Here goes the other.

282
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,905
Now get the fuck out!

283
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,164
I come from Móstoles.

284
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,375
And here it goes the way it suits me.

285
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,175
You heard me. Hurry up.

286
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,768
Do not worry, it's me.

287
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,359
What are you doing here?

288
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,361
I was scared.

289
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,613
It's nothing. I'm with you now, okay?

290
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,074
- Let's go to the cabins. - Wait.

291
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,919
Please tell them nothing.

292
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,129
Look, nobody here does you what. Nobody.

293
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,797
Come over.

294
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,767
This will force eight, shall we live?

295
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,728
It comes directly to us.

296
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,688
- Apparently. - Shit.

297
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,445
This goes down sooner than we thought.

298
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,565
What you thought that?

299
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:45,077
On my last trip, it can still crash again properly.

300
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,738
I have a bad feeling.

301
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,494
- Sorry. - Good Morning.

302
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,451
Good Morning.

303
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,203
This is Ángela.

304
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,042
- Hello. - Hello.

305
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,127
Much of yours.

306
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,384
- It's over there ... - Goro.

307
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:04,131
- And since yours is bigger fan. - The one can say.

308
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,223
Well, I see sometimes your shipment.

309
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,729
- I'm Nick. Hello. - Hello.

310
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:16,317
- It saves the video from your camera. - Well, I'll try.

311
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,986
My Camera?

312
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,359
Is she here?

313
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,788
Do you see your gear actually on TV?

314
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,248
Of course not, silly question.

315
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,048
I remember the report with the garbage men.

316
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,505
You jumped into the container.

317
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,470
And the guy did not believe his eyes.

318
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,259
That was great.

319
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,638
- Want one? - No.

320
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,449
- Excuse me, would you perhaps? - What?

321
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:13,455
Interjected something for me, something like, "Hi, I'm Ángela Vidal"?

322
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,086
That would be really great.

323
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,168
It does not have to be now.

324
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,336
With so what annoy people secure at all times.

325
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,178
What a bummer.

326
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,636
- I'm sorry. - Nonsense, that was my fault.

327
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,104
It is waterproof. At least you sold it to me.

328
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,557
If we go down.

329
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:48,114
- Have you looked at it you? - A few excerpts.

330
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:53,911
I do not know what was going on, but luckily I was not there.

331
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,879
OPERATION COMPLETE

332
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,839
There it is. Very good.

333
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:07,929
This would be done. Now I need to sort them out just yet.

334
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,966
25 frames per second. This takes.

335
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,397
- How long for? - About an hour.

336
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,932
Maybe less.

337
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,151
You really do not want any? They are delicious.

338
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,866
The.

339
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,132
He is gone. The host is gone.

340
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,218
What the hell are you saying?

341
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,136
- Sound the alarm! - No!

342
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:54,179
We need to maintain control. Complete.

343
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,252
The straps are intact.

344
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,634
- Someone has loosed him. - Impossible.

345
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,300
A security guard would have noticed something.

346
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,100
- It was during the power outage. - And what about the door code?

347
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,892
- How many know him? - Very few.

348
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,813
- Nobody does something so senseless. - All come along.

349
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,315
Get in touch with the Taser and the serum.

350
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,735
- What you up to? - Find him before he attacks someone.

351
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,704
Let's hope this works.

352
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,393
Cursed.

353
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,598
- What about the food? - What is it?

354
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:46,560
The Filipino's asleep. We've been waiting for ten minutes.

355
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,225
This useless idiot.

356
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,815
Edwin?

357
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:59,410
Holy gun barrel as it look like here?

358
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,371
Oops.

359
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,453
Well, at least you gave thee this day even bother.

360
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,127
Sag mal, träumst you DAHINTEN?

361
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,805
The men are hungry, and the mood shifts equal.

362
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,842
Come into gear, did you hear?

363
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,932
I'll take that with. Hurry up, otherwise there will be trouble.

364
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,655
OPERATION COMPLETE

365
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,993
Yes. Wonderful.

366
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,409
That's it.

367
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,502
SEND FILE

368
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,754
Today's lamb. A blessing.

369
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,218
- I hope it is because something else. - Sure.

370
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:06,352
In 20 minutes, the second layer begins. Hurry up.

371
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,847
And, how are you today?

372
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,353
The well believe that I did not notice it,

373
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,274
that they have put me into the home,

374
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,160
without me saying anything.

375
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,163
Do you have something today hunger?

376
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,288
No. The hunger is not missing me.

377
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:38,798
My stomach does not play with. Could not you talk to the steward?

378
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:44,557
Maybe he can make me some noodles or croquettes.

379
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,764
I ask for times. I can not promise anything.

380
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,852
Hello?

381
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,435
Hello?

382
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,832
Sorry.

383
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,084
Is there something else?

384
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,722
The Lady has a sensitive stomach and want some pasta or ...

385
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,528
Shit.

386
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,995
Here, try just once.

387
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,253
Bad it does not smell. I can try even once.

388
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,419
No! No! Do not eat!

389
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:06,172
- What's happening? - The chef tries to bite me.

390
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,095
- What? - And he did that?

391
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,972
No. No.

392
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,894
- Has anyone eaten what? - No.

393
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,647
Okay, you stay here.

394
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,228
- Wait. - Stay here.

395
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,649
Hold it.

396
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,442
- What happened? - I thought it was just quarantine.

397
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,569
Tell me what happened.

398
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,915
- The chef tries to bite me. - Do you know what that means?

399
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,161
- Where is he? - In the kitchen.

400
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,206
I have included it in the store.

401
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:45,136
All right. Come with me.

402
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,674
Only you.

403
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,976
Now it will not take long.

404
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,772
This will be my crowning glory.

405
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,810
Is not it?

406
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,104
Somehow it's not well.

407
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,532
I need to have an upset stomach.

408
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,445
It does not surprise me. This is the worm in the raw fish.

409
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,113
- Anisakis? - Was?

410
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,708
- This worm called Anisakis. - Whatever.

411
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,249
But there was no fish.

412
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,791
It would be better if you lie down a bit.

413
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,675
I hold the position.

414
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,977
A serum. We have worked on.

415
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,983
We were able to stop two outbreaks,

416
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,192
but next time we might have less luck.

417
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,156
I thought, nothing is known about the virus.

418
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,488
We know more than you think.

419
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,158
We have a sample.

420
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,746
We have injected a host and wait for the symptoms.

421
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,336
- One moment. Where did the test? - It does not matter.

422
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:06,050
Someone has released the host, and presents us with a problem.

423
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,552
- Excellent. - Give him the Taser.

424
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,879
We do not have much time.

425
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,391
- What are you doing? - We need to test the serum.

426
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,185
Once the door is on, press off. The electric shock will paralyze him.

427
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,441
- It has to be fast. - Okay.

428
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,397
Ready?

429
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,111
- Item. - Now!

430
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,536
Out of the way!

431
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,637
Get out of here!

432
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,429
Damn.

433
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,772
What the hell happened?

434
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,241
There is a feedback.

435
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,367
Damn, this can not be.

436
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,324
Apparently so.

437
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,116
It should have worked.

438
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:26,005
You have lost control. So, call kindly help.

439
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:30,669
- He's right. You need to get us out. - You know the rules.

440
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,595
Nobody gets us out of here.

441
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,806
Not any more.

442
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,298
We have to go to the lab and continue working.

443
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,550
Wait a minute, what about us?

444
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,421
We do not know whether the food is infected.

445
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:19,471
- No one has eaten something. - Yes, I arrived in time.

446
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:24,518
- Then there is no need to worry. - I beg your pardon? We were the second group.

447
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:29,314
- You can not leave us here. - We can not take any chances.

448
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,937
- Well then. - Now wait yet.

449
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:38,369
I gave you what you wanted. Do not do this to us at this.

450
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,907
What is he talking about?

451
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,413
I'm sorry.

452
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,245
Come on, we do not have time.

453
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,705
Lucas?

454
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,123
What have you done?

455
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:53,251
They wanted me to bring a blood sample from the building.

456
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,090
Infected blood?

457
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,756
- It was only a little. They thought ... - Who?

458
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,975
It is not a simple virus.

459
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:05,934
A few pastors have shown me terrible photos.

460
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,599
- You have no idea. - What else?

461
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,689
It is said that they would finance it all.

462
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,981
You miserable bastard! Now what?

463
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,774
Well though.

464
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,701
This is no way to deal with each other.

465
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,204
Do not know what it is.

466
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,125
Perhaps you would anyone say,

467
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,165
that your entire family is dead!

468
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,874
- Dead! - Leave her alone!

469
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,415
Enough!

470
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,676
Whatever that is,

471
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,390
if the food was infected, we can get to what passed.

472
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,812
We go to the bridge. Ortega can help us.

473
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,850
And how do we do that? We do not even weapons.

474
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,321
Take everything that benefits us. Pace.

475
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,476
- Here. - This does not help us.

476
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,440
What else is not. Lot.

477
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,024
Come on.

478
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,356
Will it soon!

479
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,214
Please do not take this as an insult,

480
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,256
but I could lay down and like something.

481
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,679
Back, back.

482
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,272
The, the, the.

483
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,270
Back, back, back. Back!

484
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,486
Shit!

485
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,578
Away from it!

486
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,663
We have to get out of here!

487
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,771
Come on, we need to bridge.

488
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,564
Come on, let's go.

489
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,030
They are everywhere on the ship. Where is Goro?

490
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,113
His concern was not good. He is lying down.

491
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,322
Shit.

492
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,158
- Deep sea. What's up? 
- All quiet down there?

493
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,619
I did not come to dinner.

494
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,660
Then keep it up until you hear from me again.

495
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,329
- What's going on? 
- Do what I tell you.

496
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,050
Lock the door.

497
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,529
Here long. Comes.

498
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,911
- Are you sure? - Yea, come.

499
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,370
Call my children to pick me up.

500
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,996
We're almost there.

501
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,747
- I make them any circumstances. - Come on.

502
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,477
What is now? Do you have anything to do?

503
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:24,900
What is this?

504
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:55,769
Get out of here!

505
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,056
Help me!

506
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,355
- I can not. - Shoot!

507
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,478
- I can not. - Help me!

508
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,816
What the hell is that?

509
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,778
Let him go!

510
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,668
What's this?

511
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:24,665
The oil pressure decreases. This was just what we needed.

512
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,030
Get out there!

513
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:03,079
Damn shit! What was that?

514
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,881
- Are you all right? - Yes.

515
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,798
Where is she?

516
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,008
- You ran away. - I get the same too!

517
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:20,225
- What do we do now? - You go to the bridge. I am looking for.

518
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,222
Hey, where are you going?

519
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,942
You have no weapon. That would be sheer suicide.

520
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,570
We can not let them down.

521
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,574
I've messed up.

522
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,946
I am what you owe.

523
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,959
Let's go.

524
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,561
It's us. Make you!

525
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,529
- Do not. - But ...

526
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,032
- Open up! - Perhaps they are infected.

527
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,533
- Nick! - Goro! Goro!

528
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,157
Los purely with you.

529
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,954
Close your door!

530
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,664
What's going on out there? Are the doctors coming after you?

531
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:32,838
Now you are in command. We go home.

532
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,755
I would like to, but the engine oil comes out.

533
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,637
He could catch fire. I put it off.

534
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,978
- No! No! - Man, now calm down!

535
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,315
Wait. We could turn on the auxiliary motor.

536
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:51,320
- Then do it. - This is only from the engine room.

537
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:55,111
To give a shit! What is really going on here?

538
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,113
You were in the building.

539
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,828
I have no idea. But these doctors know something.

540
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,866
And we need to find out what it is.

541
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:08,291
Logo. And how do we do that? Want to ask them easily?

542
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,382
Can not you hack into their computers?

543
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,764
You have connected me to send them the video.

544
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,317
Shit that have an internal encryption.

545
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,232
- What is that? - Not game.

546
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,446
I'm at a loss. It's all right.

547
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,576
It should have worked.

548
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,660
Maybe the virus has mutated in the DNA of the host.

549
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,457
- Then, each sample would be different. - Damn it.

550
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:54,216
We need the original strain that is not mutated.

551
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,627
The girl.

552
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,884
But we do not.

553
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,220
Gentlemen,

554
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,102
it's over.

555
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,554
No, wait.

556
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:12,317
- There must be a way. - I'm sorry.

557
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,352
You know the protocol.

558
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:24,617
- No. - 20 minutes. Enjoy them.

559
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,207
Waiting. We could try it with an enzyme inhibitor.

560
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:32,041
Maybe we reach a higher strength of the membrane.

561
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,882
This keeps only the process. It would not do.

562
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,465
Not without the original strain. I'm sorry.

563
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,472
I beg you. You can not do that.

564
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,887
We were not allowed to fail.

565
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,302
- You know the rules. - No.

566
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,805
Wait. He has done it.

567
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,766
We have the video.

568
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,896
Here, look at yourself.

569
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,862
- What are the oldest folder? - One moment.

570
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,164
Here.

571
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,371
What is this?

572
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,706
- My goodness. - Wait, wait.

573
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,800
I know that name.

574
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:25,553
From the building. He stood there on newspaper clippings.

575
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,849
This is the same girl. Since all photos hanging from it.

576
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,523
These are treatment data.

577
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,776
The Diocese of Naples has admitted it.

578
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,071
- The Church? - "Medical findings." What's this?

579
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,743
Wait a minute.

580
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,247
Was in the newspaper that she was possessed.

581
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:55,083
It was about the church, and a demon.

582
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,750
Let the shit.

583
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:01,297
It all makes sense. They wanted a doctor's judgment.

584
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,721
And who has admitted it?

585
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,432
Look at one.

586
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:21,775
What's this?

587
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,652
- It does not exist. -. And if it's the girl.

588
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:33,200
- What was she doing there? - It's rewind.

589
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,255
What is happening?

590
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,924
Oh Gott.

591
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,635
It is a parasite.

592
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:57,566
The source of the virus. We had him under our noses.

593
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:01,354
So this is the demon: a parasite.

594
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:05,527
This thing has used the girl as a wearer.

595
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,657
But in order to protect himself, he has immunized them.

596
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:14,533
It's all the years grown in the body of the girl.

597
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,952
Until he found a more suitable host.

598
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:23,257
We have the original strain. Set things up for the procedure.

599
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:27,345
We need to see her this thing. It is not too late.

600
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,058
Lady.

601
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,895
Señora, we have to the other.

602
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,560
Come with me.

603
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,003
No, no, no.

604
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,395
You can contact me times.

605
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,649
Do not move.

606
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,863
Drop your weapon and turn around.

607
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,786
Where is the reporter?

608
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,374
On cruise.

609
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,634
For the last time.

610
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:54,925
Where is she?

611
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,062
- What's happening? He does not respond? - No.

612
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,973
And he will not.

613
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,560
Then we go down yourself and make the engine.

614
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:09,196
For sure. Nothing easier than that. But I do not go out there.

615
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,739
Shall we wait around here until these critters come from?

616
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,495
This is my last trip.

617
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:21,660
If someone wants to go home, it's me. But I want to arrive alive.

618
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,497
Power on!

619
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,332
- Lucas! - Power on.

620
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,472
What is this?

621
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,725
No one touches them. Walk away from her.

622
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,013
- What's going on here? - It is a parasite. She wears it.

623
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:44,311
- From him the virus goes out. - I beg your pardon?

624
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,397
- What did you say? - The video shows it clearly.

625
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,779
You can look at it like.

626
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,773
What are you talking nonsense?

627
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,317
- It is clean. - This it is.

628
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:59,494
This thing immunized its host. So he can go undetected.

629
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,159
- Easy, we need her alive. - Let her go!

630
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,172
- You make a mistake. - They should let them go.

631
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:20,135
- Your gun is unloaded. - The here before.

632
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,895
You probably do not understand. The parasite is the original strain.

633
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:29,937
Only through Him we get the serum. It's the only way.

634
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,861
- I do not care. - Please, be reasonable.

635
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,902
We take him out of her without hurting her.

636
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,991
No, you not believe a word.

637
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,325
You are a doctor.

638
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:44,371
You know only too well that it is our only chance.

639
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,960
No.

640
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,045
No.

641
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,510
No!

642
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:58,222
- For the laboratory it is too far. - We take the table.

643
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,716
- Fast. - No!

644
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,219
- Beeilung.
- Nick! Nick!

645
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:03,932
Careful.

646
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,806
No, do not. No! No!

647
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,351
- On the back. - Help!

648
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,732
Hold on tight.

649
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,866
Bind it firmly. Very good.

650
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,365
Wait, and if you're wrong?

651
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:27,369
As I said, you can view the video itself.

652
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,167
- Time is running out. - Nick.

653
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:31,505
Release it.

654
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,092
- I can not find it. - He must be there.

655
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,836
Doctor here.

656
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,318
Hold her head. Concentration.

657
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,653
So.

658
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,077
- I need towels. - In the bathroom.

659
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,873
Come on, quickly!

660
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,306
Fast. Here, hold her tight.

661
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,724
What is going on here?

662
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:34,064
No. No!

663
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:42,323
- Help me damned! - I have no ammunition.

664
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,081
Shoot. Shoot!

665
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:48,450
- What is it? - No idea.

666
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,553
Grab it! Go!

667
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,009
Shoot!

668
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,137
Shoot already! Go!

669
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:14,567
Holds it! You can not escape.

670
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:49,010
It's just a scratch. It's nothing.

671
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:51,558
No.

672
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:53,731
Waits.

673
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:57,769
With the strain it works. You said it yourself.

674
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,905
We can synthesize the serum yet.

675
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,400
There is no time. You know that.

676
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,120
You need me yet.

677
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,199
No.

678
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,384
- Now what? - Now we are looking for the reporter.

679
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:23,385
No, the game is over.

680
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:27,094
They now call for help. Only you can operate the radio.

681
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,310
- Not without serum. - You never get.

682
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,471
If we do not get it,

683
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:37,062
We return with safety back anywhere.

684
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,603
Come on, we have no time.

685
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:47,076
Radio frequency to nine. It can not be far away.

686
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,352
Fog.

687
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,734
So, to me that's enough. Can you steer the ship?

688
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:33,160
I can try. I helped a few times.

689
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:43,291
We go down. Do you know how in terms of the auxiliary engine?

690
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,885
I think so. But I'm not going down.

691
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:50,344
With four knives we will not get far.

692
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:53,225
- Let the shit. - Do you know something better?

693
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:57,605
Waits. In the chest at the front deck are fishing equipment.

694
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:59,682
Oh great, now we go fishing.

695
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:02,648
You stay here. We're going to look.

696
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,939
When we get back, we'll go into the engine room.

697
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,444
From closing. You're the only one who can steer the ship.

698
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,537
This is the front cover.

699
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:25,674
This is a damn maze.

700
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,759
Da. There she is.

701
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,150
I have them. It is at the cabins.

702
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,024
- Where?
 - In the hallway to the cabins.

703
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,692
The, Beeilung!

704
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,419
Shit, she goes off to the cameras.

705
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,595
I lost it.

706
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,642
Where is she?

707
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:27,069
So a damn shit!

708
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,013
I see you. She goes to the dining room.

709
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,432
Go forward!

710
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:12,740
She is in the transition to the dining room. Hurry! Hurry!

711
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,363
Ángela, no. Over here.

712
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,958
It's me, Nick. Take the radio.

713
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,461
Now take it already.

714
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,832
Come on, Ángela. Now take it already.

715
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,843
Okay, now the Seven.

716
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:36,589
Push the Seven. Come on, pressing the Seven.

717
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:41,185
- Nick? - Now we can talk. I see you.

718
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,220
If you demolierst the cameras,

719
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,642
I can do nothing.

720
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:48,267
- All right.
 - Run away. They're after you.

721
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,229
What are you waiting for?

722
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:52,605
They're right there.

723
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:59,112
What are you doing? They are every moment with you.

724
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,573
Ángela, listen to me.

725
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:04,200
You must immediately since gone.

726
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,959
Next.

727
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:14,794
Why are you doing this?

728
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:20,098
- You go inside. - All right.

729
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,192
- Los, los, los! - Hier, nimm.

730
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,611
- What are you doing, Lucas? - Wait!

731
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,234
Come on, come on!

732
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,411
The party can start.

733
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,328
Where is she? How can they escape us only?

734
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:47,417
- We already had. - Caution.

735
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:51,168
Where the hell are they hiding?

736
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:57,970
Help!

737
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:00,343
Help me!

738
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,431
Do something! The fire extinguisher!

739
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,725
Take the fire extinguisher. Come on!

740
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,941
Time!

741
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,020
Help!

742
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,149
- I do not know how that goes. - Pull him one on!

743
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,370
You are wrong.

744
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:36,005
I do not know what you want from me, but you're wrong.

745
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:48,221
Now you can check it.

746
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:52,479
Go to your laboratory shit back and check it.

747
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,193
And then you leave me alone.

748
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,204
I'm sorry.

749
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,708
- And now? We have no more weapons. - You can go.

750
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,296
Wait.

751
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,217
What do you have in your hand?

752
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,803
They were bitten.

753
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,027
Do not! No!

754
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,459
BEGIN ANALYSIS

755
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,216
DATA PROCESSING IN PROGRESS

756
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,686
Nick? Nick, are you there?

757
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,691
Why did you do that?

758
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,899
Trust me. I need the code to the laboratory.

759
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,067
Was?

760
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:25,489
I have to prove that they are wrong them.

761
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,153
Please.

762
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:30,243
But you have bitten him. I've seen it.

763
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,702
Trust me, Nick.

764
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:36,420
Together we can get away from here, but I need the code.

765
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,255
I beg you.

766
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,460
Nick.

767
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,129
All right. I give it to you.

768
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:51,344
Guzmán has shown me how I abfilme him through the camera.

769
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:55,185
Here it is. I hope you know what you're doing.

770
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,320
That can not be.

771
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,003
That can not be.

772
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:23,000
- But it is so. - But I've seen it myself.

773
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:26,720
- He has penetrated into you. - I do not care.

774
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,347
I'm not the one you are looking for.

775
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,959
- Harpoons. - Right, harpoons.

776
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:02,668
And nothing more?

777
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,585
- I see. - All right.

778
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:09,506
We're going down, and you put the engine.

779
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:10,923
Then it's time to go home.

780
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:13,346
Waits. Ángela is healthy.

781
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:17,096
Ricarte it has reviewed. I saw it by the cameras.

782
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,398
It is in the laboratory. We need to get them.

783
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:26,150
All right, I'll go. You two going into the engine room.

784
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:27,860
We meet here.

785
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,331
- Say it. - It is impossible.

786
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:40,293
- There must be an error. - There is no mistake!

787
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:46,216
You must stay away from me or I'll kill you!

788
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,381
Tell them! Now!

789
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:49,924
Say what?

790
01:11:56,687 --> 01:12:00,852
The parasite leaves the host when he finds a more suitable.

791
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:04,109
Through them he could make it out of the building.

792
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,563
The video proves it. We have seen it.

793
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,324
I do not care. Their analysis has found what else.

794
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,907
If she was the host, you would be infected.

795
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,789
- She bit her. - I know that too.

796
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,827
But there must be an explanation.

797
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:24,754
You fooled us something.

798
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,429
Is that true, Ángela? Deceiving you tell us from what?

799
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:38,977
And you? Perhaps you are deceiving us from what?

800
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,274
Why did you want the code to the lab?

801
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:49,150
You asked Nick about it. How So?

802
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:51,365
I wanted to know what's in there.

803
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:56,195
When I met you, you came out of the lab, right?

804
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,078
You've released the monkeys.

805
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:05,497
Oh, yeah? And why should I have done that?

806
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:11,381
You saved me from the building.

807
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,797
We were almost a minute alone.

808
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,601
If this thing inside of me ...

809
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:24,977
It leaves its host when it finds a better one.

810
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,726
- Was not it? - Right.

811
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,815
The old host is then useless.

812
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,824
You are very brave, Ángela. I like that.

813
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,042
Self-destruction enabled.

814
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,454
Only 20 minutes.

815
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,129
- It's over. - Die!

816
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,977
Where are you going, Ángela?

817
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,408
Attention, you so do not hurt.

818
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,182
Immediately evacuate.

819
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,392
Now the party starts.

820
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:49,774
The detonation takes place in 18 minutes.

821
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,106
Immediately evacuate.

822
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,064
No!

823
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,801
Hold it.

824
01:16:58,864 --> 01:16:59,945
Go back!

825
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:04,485
Give it to him!

826
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,757
Let's go, Nick. Go!

827
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,017
Los, los.

828
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,774
Here long.

829
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,487
- Here it is? - Yes.

830
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,741
- Fast. - Shit.

831
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,651
What is it?

832
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:50,037
- Nick, what is? - It's not.

833
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,699
Why not? You mean, you can.

834
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,078
- I said I can try. - Now, come on!

835
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,100
- Quick, quick! - Yes.

836
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:18,017
Come on! Shit.

837
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:20,360
Damn!

838
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,604
Shit.

839
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,444
Give me that.

840
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,953
- Run, Nick! - Shit!

841
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,869
Take to the motor!

842
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,302
Help me, Nick!

843
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:52,718
The Nick!

844
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:02,978
- No, no. Please do not. - Nick!

845
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:14,202
Immediately evacuate. The detonation takes place in 13 minutes.

846
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:16,992
Immediately evacuate.

847
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:25,501
Immediately evacuate. The detonation takes place in 13 minutes.

848
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:25,603
Immediately evacuate. The detonation is performed in ten minutes.

849
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,817
Immediately evacuate.

850
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:33,118
No, do not. I am healthy. I am clean.

851
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,447
- Where is Angela? - I dont know. We disappear.

852
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,204
The ship will explode.

853
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:45,205
See ago. This is an inflatable rescue boat.

854
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:48,630
- The engine we can use. - Where is Angela?

855
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:53,221
Forget it. It's too late. You must think of yourself.

856
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:58,017
We make it two for this ship down.

857
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,897
Really.

858
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,854
Leck mich doch.

859
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:15,697
Class, Nick.

860
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:26,964
Immediately evacuate. The detonation is carried out in eight minutes.

861
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,498
Cursed.

862
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,184
Angela!

863
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:50,187
Monkeys!

864
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:09,668
Shit.

865
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:15,886
We have to go. The thing is in the air.

866
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:18,048
Holy shit!

867
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:20,012
- No! - Come on, the dining room.

868
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,024
You are away.

869
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,250
- Do you hear something? - No.

870
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:53,133
Immediately evacuate. The detonation takes place in six minutes.

871
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:58,255
We need to cover. The time is equal expired.

872
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:01,766
And the engine? Where is the engine?

873
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:05,428
- He has wedged itself. He is in progress. - Damn!

874
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:06,972
It does not matter.

875
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:11,814
We go out, get him and run away, okay?

876
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:13,648
All right.

877
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,360
One two three.

878
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:22,153
Did you think you get away from me?

879
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,545
After all, what we have experienced together?

880
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,177
No, do not!

881
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:41,051
No!

882
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:47,729
No, Ángela. I come to you with. I still have a lot to do.

883
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:28,887
Let's get out of here, go!

884
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,805
Detonation in four minutes.

885
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:33,183
The, lauf! Los!

886
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:35,184
Immediately evacuate.

887
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,330
The, lauf!

888
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,587
Weg hier, los!

889
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,467
Run!

890
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:13,810
Run!

891
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:20,609
Give me the engine. Give it to me!

892
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:52,311
- We have to jump. - No!

893
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:55,394
Then bring to us. Spring already!

894
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:56,858
No!

895
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,230
I can not!

896
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,189
Spring!

897
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:08,445
Nick!

898
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:15,038
Spring, Angela!

899
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:22,925
Nick!

900
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,727
Lass's, Angela. Na los!

901
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:39,229
You have to let go! Go!

902
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,963
Angela!

903
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:14,264
Angela!

904
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,061
Angela!

905
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,972
- Nick! - Here! Take my hand!

906
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,484
Take my hand!

907
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:12,951
Take my hand, Ángela.

908
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,393

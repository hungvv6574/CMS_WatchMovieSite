[EXECUTIVE PRODUCER KIM WOO TAEK]

6
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,829
We're your average high school friends
who swore to a lifetime of friendship.

7
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,719
Even though it wasn't under any special
circumstances where our friendship began

8
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,230
it was still special to us
in our own way.

9
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,379
Ahem... ahem.

10
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,010
Ahem...

11
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,440
[MEET ME IN THE SCHOOL BACKYARD.]

12
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,609
- Did you fondle So Min's chest?
- No.

13
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,909
I didn't fondle her chest,
but I just stood there and touched it.

14
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,340
- You must be mental.
- Is that a question?

15
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,380
You think that was a question, you asshole?

16
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,509
Hey, it's not like we're kids anymore.

17
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,040
What are you guys thinking
to fight over a girl like that?

18
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,730
You guys need to be reasonable about this.

19
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,700
- Play rock-paper-scissors for it.
- That's a good idea. Let's do it!

20
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,359
Okay, we'll only play
one round like real men.

21
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,800
Rock-paper-scissors!

22
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,170
A real man throws out a rock.
Rock-paper-scissors.

23
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,370
Let's do it again. Rock-paper-scissors.

24
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,150
Rock-paper-scissors.

25
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,220
Rock-paper-scissors.

26
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,709
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I'll date her first.

27
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,249
Since I won at rock-paper-scissors,
and I've even touched her chest.

28
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,850
Come on, it's not like our relationship
is going to last forever or anything.

29
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,299
Just stick close by me

30
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,029
and you guys can play for her again
whenever I break up with her.

31
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,740
Sound good?

32
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,219
It didn't feel entirely right

33
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,799
the three of us spent most of our time
together ever since that moment.

34
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,019
During all of our years together

35
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,519
there were trivial worries
over our grades...

36
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,159
- I think I flunked the exam.
- I'm just happy that it's over with.

37
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,660
And much bigger worries like
Dong Woo's father going bankrupt.

38
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,390
My family is the one in the dumps,
so why are you two looking so glum?

39
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,330
We were just playing the part, you idiot.

40
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,459
- Ouch, that's hot.
- Hot!

41
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,709
I heard you touched Soo Jung's chest?

42
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,909
Yeah.

43
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,530
Sorry I didn't tell you about it first.

44
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,289
Even though we're breaking up now

45
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:02,249
as your friend, and fellow classmate,
I will always wish you the best.

46
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,910
Fighting.

47
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,999
There was even a time when we didn't
realize what a problem it could pose

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,699
when a girl would give us an ear
splitting slap across the face.

49
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,819
I can't hear anything that you're saying.

50
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,209
You're such a moron.

51
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,149
I never knew that a girl
could turn into such a bitch.

52
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,430
But I guess a person of any gender
can turn into a bitch.

53
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,190
I'm getting too old for this.

54
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,540
His use of the phrase,
"Getting too old for this"

55
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,259
definitely felt weird as I was hearing it

56
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,700
but the phrase also carried some weight
as we stood, in the face of our twenties.

57
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,069
Okay, we're standing
in the middle of a crossroad.

58
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,529
Between dream and reality.

59
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,519
Up to this point, all the mistakes
that we've made in our past

60
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,340
has been excused because we were young,
and lacked real-life experience.

61
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,139
However, as we stand here,
older and more experienced...

62
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,459
I believe we need to be more responsible
in the choices that we make.

63
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,079
No matter which path we choose to take

64
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,940
let's respect and support
each other's decisions.

65
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,470
- I'm going to take this path.
- I'm going to take this one.

66
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,489
There's something
that you guys aren't getting.

67
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,269
This isn't just a dual path

68
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,950
but there are three paths
to choose from.

69
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,470
- I'm going to go this way.
- Hey, Chi Ho.

70
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,339
- You like women's breasts, don't you?
- It's what I live for.

71
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,459
Going down that path will lead you back
to your mom's breast, not to other women's.

72
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,679
- Oh, shit.
- Yuck.

73
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,500
Okay, a man must go forward.
Show me some respect.

74
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,949
- But must we make this decision now?
- No kidding. We're still young.

75
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,369
Hey, split the years of your life in half.
Where do you think that middle is?

76
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,889
- I'll probably live to be 80 years old.
- How can you be sure you'll live to be 80?

77
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,099
My father passed away at age 40,
and Mozart died when he was 35.

78
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,799
- Kurt Cobain died when he was 27. 27!
- Kurt Cobain committed suicide.

79
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,359
How can you be sure
that you won't commit suicide?

80
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,709
So what's your point?
You want us to buy life insurance?

81
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,679
If we were to divide our lives into halves

82
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,179
then half will be spent as minors,
and other half as adults.

83
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,840
Meaning, the mid point of our lives...

84
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,109
is at 20 years old.

85
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,599
We've already lived half our lives?

86
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,790
- Wow, we've aged fast.
- Now that we're at our midpoint...

87
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,290
- We can't just sit around like this.
- My point exactly.

88
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,509
Sex.

89
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,759
- Let's have sex.
- The three of us?

90
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,019
Ugh, you're such a moron.

91
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,899
- Let's not lose our focus here.
- This is a very serious problem.

92
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,289
Don't you guys ever
read any foreign news?

93
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,789
On average, most teens in Germany
lose their virginity by the age of 15.

94
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,399
They worry about contracting STDs
while we worry about doing our homework.

95
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,319
Condoms are given out like candy,
and what's the result of all that?

96
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,009
- Mercedes, Audi.. the best in the world.
- Wow.

97
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,669
How old are you guys?
You guys are 20 years old.

98
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,829
But let's not turn into monsters.

99
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,799
Then the monster that you see
in the movie, "The Host"...

100
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,039
- Is it because it didn't have sex?
- Yeah.

101
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,039
- That sounds like a sad movie.
- That movie made me cry.

102
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,519
- Let's have sex.
- Let's do it.

103
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,719
Fine, let's just do it.

104
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,649
My body is just going to rot
once I'm dead anyway.

105
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,110
- Let's just do it.
- She's so much better when she's sober.

106
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,149
Her problem is not knowing when to stop.

107
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,749
I think I take offense to that.

108
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,139
Hey, Cha Chi Ho.

109
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,399
You said your goal in life is to sleep
with 3,000 women before you die.

110
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,429
So why is it that you haven't
laid a finger on me yet?

111
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,290
- Are you saving me for last?
- Did she actually bring a pillow?

112
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,060
Here, now is your chance.

113
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,949
- Come here, you asshole.
- Are you kidding me?

114
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,169
She'll catch a cold if she
sleeps on that cold floor.

115
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,039
- Leave her. Let her catch a cold.
- Pour me a drink.

116
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,580
Honey?

117
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,650
- Oh my goodness...
- Kids these days are so spoiled.

118
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:36,379
- She is spoiled.
- You're a mess, Kid.

119
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,959
Look, it's Cha Chi Ho.

120
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,569
Better be careful
before she hurts herself.

121
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,300
Thanks for your concern,
but you just worry about yourself.

122
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,910
So, where did I leave off in my story?

123
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,230
I... don't want to
become a monster.

124
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,299
Sir, I'm against the idea
of prostitution

125
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,889
so I have no idea how, when,
or where I'm going to get laid.

126
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,989
Do not be afraid.

127
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,720
Do not think that it's impossible.
You're already ready for it.

128
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,029
Just... just...
How do I put this...

129
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,599
Just think of it as
a simple negotiation.

130
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,439
First...

131
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,599
I will walk you through
the negotiation steps for you.

132
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,180
- I'll take you out to the scene.
- You're a real true friend.

133
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,020
I'm so nervous.

134
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,130
But where?

135
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,299
I like this music.

136
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,600
- What is it?
- I don't know.

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,540
No more drinks for me.
I can feel myself turning red.

138
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,920
Okay, stop drinking.
I'll drink the rest myself.

139
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,769
- But don't you want her to drink?
- Don't push it, or it'll seem obvious.

140
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,639
This girl's desire for food
is much stronger than her sexual urges.

141
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,379
She'll think that you're not
trying to put the moves on her

142
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,009
and she'll start drinking again so that
she doesn't lose her drinks to you.

143
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,819
- Never stop analyzing your subject.
- You should tackle your studies like that.

144
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,960
Stop being so absurd.

145
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,820
You got it?
I'm glad my parents are never home.

146
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,369
The drinks are flowing,
and you've got the house to yourself.

147
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,489
Just don't act like a moron,
and you've got her in your bed.

148
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,499
- Act like a moron, how?
- Like calling the girl's father.

149
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,639
Yes, sir.

150
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,199
We're about to turn off the lights,
and get it on.

151
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,199
Yes, your daughter has
already agreed to it

152
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,649
and we're just waiting for you
to give us the all-clear.

153
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,299
- But you're not going to do that.
- Of course not.

154
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,860
Then it's a guaranteed score. Unless...

155
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,509
That's what all women are like.

156
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,890
They go around doing
whatever they want, but

157
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,209
they never let their
friends do anything.

158
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,470
I don't know what kind of bullshit
that is, but it's a threat.

159
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,659
A real live threat.

160
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,350
If you don't stay alert,
then you'll lose your chance.

161
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,839
Don't show that you're panicking.
Rather, get the girl flustered.

162
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,150
Then... it's time to go in for the kill.

163
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,410
I want to rub my dick all over your ass.

164
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,879
- She's shocked to hear that, right?
- That's an understatement.

165
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,739
Because you just don't say that.
She's now wondering what your deal is.

166
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,529
It's called, “cognitive dissonance.”
She doesn't know what to make of it.

167
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,010
That's when you go in for the kill.

168
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:52,090
Your male reproductive organs
have long finished maturing by this point.

169
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,839
But our nation's education system
disregarded that reality

170
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,919
and worked to keep that bit of truth
strictly hidden away from us.

171
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,389
They only emphasized the need
for academic achievement

172
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,909
and completely stomped out
our natural burning desire for the flesh

173
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,509
by enforcing us to live our lives
like celibate monks.

174
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,569
The Korean education system
can go fuck itself.

175
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:18,660
This is your true education.
Behold, my friends.

176
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,250
The divine Buddha has heard our prayers

177
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,970
and is giving us his blessing for us
to join our flesh together as one.

178
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,320
Shall we all join our bodies together?

179
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,449
Here's my own definition of
what sex means to me so far.

180
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,729
Something so near, yet so far...

181
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,619
A dream made into reality
by the shake of your own hand.

182
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,149
There's no shame in it.

183
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,209
There are only two types of men
who does not masturbate.

184
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,290
He's either missing his hands,
or missing his dick.

185
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,470
Kyung Jae. Kyung Jae.

186
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,539
In despair over his low test scores,
a high school student commits suicide.

187
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,219
It's a tragic story that
we hear about every year

188
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,520
but the student of this specific story
was well known for his good grades.

189
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,370
- Mom!
- Hey!

190
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,659
Mom, there's something wrong
with Kyung Jae.

191
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,980
He's keeps beating himself on his thighs
while watching some lunatic scream

192
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,259
on his computer screen.

193
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,080
Let Mom sleep, and I'll explain.

194
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,649
- Kyung Jae, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

195
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,459
I'll explain.

196
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,479
It's almost like a rite of passage
before a man starts college.

197
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,709
It's not a religion,
but religious people do it, too.

198
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,650
- Something that most men do...
- Were you beating off?

199
00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:00,470
Our twenties started off
on a rather insignificant note.

200
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,199
What's the first thing that a man does
when he enters a brand new environment?

201
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,859
Finding a pretty girl.

202
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,120
It's not like he'll do anything about it,
but it's pathetically true.

203
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,840
It's not like I wasn't hoping for
a campus romance like you see in dramas.

204
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,250
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

205
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,569
I'm worried you may have
dislocated your shoulder.

206
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,209
- No, I'm fine. Really.
- No.

207
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,769
- But I feel really bad.
- I'm fine.

208
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,090
- Let me buy you a steak buffet dinner...
- No, I said I was fine.

209
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,929
A drop in the nation's bonds...

210
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,579
This is a good environment for me.

211
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,069
I will devote myself
to my academic pursuits.

212
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:15,259
I'll make sure to work tirelessly
to build up my credentials

213
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,080
and will ready myself
for the job hunt.

214
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,939
You heard about
freshmen orientation tonight, right?›.

215
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,110
Ah, that's right. Of course.

216
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,909
Hey In Gook, what was your surname again?

217
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,850
Me? Hwang.

218
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,320
- What was your name?
- Oh...

219
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,969
Kyung Jae.

220
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,850
- Lee Kyung Jae.
- Kim Kyung Jae.

221
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,909
The Kimhae clan, right?

222
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,240
No, the Andong clan.

223
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,940
- Mom!
- Mom!

224
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,629
All right! Bubble wrap!

225
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,420
Mom, there's no playground around here.
Buy us one, huh?

226
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,269
Dong Woo has a clear goal in mind.

227
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,379
He chose to repeat his final year
because of the college tuition

228
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,809
but he's working hard to save up money
from his part-time jobs

229
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,890
and he'll later become
Korea's best comics artist one day.

230
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,899
Enjoy.

231
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,249
- Excuse us.
- Yes?

232
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,969
We ordered half and half.

233
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,730
Then why did you order
a plain fried chicken?

234
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,150
I'm sorry. My apologies.

235
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,219
What are you doing?

236
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,909
I'm sitting still.

237
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,490
What are you doing while sitting still?

238
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,040
Nothing.

239
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:53,519
Chi Ho's goal was...
to keep breathing.

240
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,270
He's already accomplished that goal.

241
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,880
- Business Management!
- Business Management!

242
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,499
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

243
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,319
- Business! Management!
- Business! Management!

244
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,139
Now the other way!

245
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,649
Don't you dare spill a drop!

246
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,429
I would accept it if this was
also part of the process

247
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,929
but I was a bit disappointed.

248
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:22,770
In the idea that a welcoming party for
intellectuals wasn't at all intellectual.

249
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,699
Um...

250
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,469
I looked at you because
I thought we've met before

251
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,109
but my intention wasn't
to hit on you or come on to you.

252
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,829
- I'm sorry.
- Hi.

253
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,930
Yes, hello.

254
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,820
Do you know me?

255
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,629
I'm sure a lot of people do.

256
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,510
I'll give you a ride
if you're headed to school.

257
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,259
I totally fell on my back, didn't I?

258
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,289
The party culture is the problem.

259
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,140
Nothing to feel embarrassed about.

260
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,829
Am I driving too fast?
Are you scared?

261
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,119
What?

262
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,130
Wow.

263
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,999
I enjoy the thrill.

264
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,770
I'm actually very comfortable right now.

265
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,530
Senior, thank you.

266
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,030
You're that way, right?
See you next time.

267
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,579
What's going on here?

268
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,629
How is it that you're
getting out of her car?

269
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,779
You heard her right?
She said, "See you next time."

270
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,509
What does that mean?

271
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,169
What are you saying, you moron?

272
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,359
Don't go over-analyzing her words now.

273
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,539
She must be really rich, though.

274
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,259
I don't know about that, but I did hear
she made some money in stocks.

275
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,789
- Stocks?
- She's the ace of the stock club.

276
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,230
She's the top dog
in the university.

277
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,590
How could you be getting out of her car?

278
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,480
I ran into her at the bus stop,
and she recognized me.

279
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,849
- Huh?
- Huh?

280
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,479
- Hm?
- Huh?

281
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,669
I didn't recognize her,
but she recognized me and...

282
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,009
Oh, I guess that makes sense.

283
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,609
You haven't seen this yet, have you?
You should see this.

284
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,449
You're on Facebook.

285
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,350
- I am?
- Yeah.

286
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,509
No more! I can't drink anymore!

287
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,970
How is this a welcome party?
This is a suicide mission!

288
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,910
He swallowed his own vomit!

289
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,840
The party culture is the problem.
Nothing to feel embarrassed about.

290
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,090
You're a Facebook star, man.

291
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,630
In Gook... This isn't right.

292
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,049
Hey, repeat student.

293
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,729
I'm repeating my year
under very sad circumstances.

294
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,250
- I'm not cool with that.
- But I'm cool.

295
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,730
- Do you beat off, too?
- What!

296
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,780
- What the heck?
- I caught my brother beating off.

297
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,120
I even asked him how often he does it.

298
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,999
It was totally hilarious.

299
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,839
That moron.
He should've been more cautious.

300
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,279
He was being cautious,
but I unlocked his door.

301
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,760
Why did you unlock his door?

302
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,399
Ugh, seriously.

303
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,139
I read somewhere that a use of lubrication
is crucial when masturbating.

304
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,779
Keep it down!

305
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,270
Beating it dry may be too much stimulation,
which could leave you desensitized.

306
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,440
But the grip of a woman's body isn't
as strong as the grip of your own hand.

307
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,000
Which can cause an issue for you when
you actually start sleeping with a woman.

308
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,060
- So make sure to always use a lube...
- Go sit somewhere else!

309
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,899
- I want pasta. Buy me some.
- Me? When I'm broke and penniless?

310
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,359
Ugh, this is so stressful.

311
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,259
I wish I could just find a rich man,
but I don't have any time to meet anyone.

312
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,069
And I'm a man to you?

313
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,440
Of course you're a man.
You even masturbate.

314
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,659
- Ugh, that Kim Kyung Jae!
- At least buy me some ddukbokki.

315
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,599
- Come on, buy me some!
- How about I buy you some instead?

316
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Hey!

317
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,579
Dong Woo is so penniless!

318
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,480
Hi, Dong Woo.
Have you been well?

319
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,939
I know your school isn't close,
so what brings you by here?

320
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,099
It's not that far.

321
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,159
- Because I wanted to see you.
- See me?

322
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,030
Yeah, I have missed you.

323
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,119
How about you and I ditch So Hee,
and go grab a beer somewhere?

324
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,550
Wow, that's so low.
Are all college students like this?

325
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,959
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I have to work early in the morning.

326
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,879
- Is it because you're broke?
- I have money.

327
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,420
- You said you had to buy rice.
- It'll be my treat.

328
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,770
Sorry, but I don't think I can tonight.

329
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,780
- That's too bad.
- You and I can go instead.

330
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,589
Forget it.

331
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,240
- How much do we owe you?
- I've got money, so I'll pay.

332
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,330
- Look at you trying to act all cool.
- Keep your mouth shut.

333
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,000
Hey, did you know that
Dong Woo beats off?

334
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,109
Seriously!

335
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,049
Knock it off!
You've been saying that all day!

336
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,989
Oh my... you're actually getting upset.

337
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,190
I guess I'll be saying it tomorrow, too.

338
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,190
Your card has been declined.

339
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,590
Mom.

340
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,649
Did you take money out of
my bank account?

341
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,990
Something came up,
and I needed the money.

342
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,789
Why would you take money out of someone
else's account without even telling them?

343
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,369
It's not like we're strangers.
You even have your weekend job.

344
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,369
That's so I can pay for my tuition.
How am I supposed to eat now?

345
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,169
- Am I to just starve?
- Then you never should've moved out.

346
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,409
How am I to study in that tiny rural town?

347
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,730
There are art academies
around here, too...

348
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,670
Ugh, forget it.

349
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,429
Home sweet home.

350
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,010
I'm very happy right now.

351
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,249
There are some nasty rumors
going around about you.

352
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:07,070
I was giving my friends a field lesson.
She's acting like a child.

353
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,729
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

354
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,789
I just got home and am going to bed.

355
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,629
You know that I'm nocturnal.

356
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,050
Hey, come over here and have a seat.

357
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,690
I seriously have no idea...
where we went wrong with you.

358
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:47,110
Isn't that something a scientist would say
when he fails one of his experiments?

359
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,489
Let's just stop all this nonsense,
and come learn business from me.

360
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,349
We can take it slow
while you go to culinary school.

361
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,389
Isn't having one chef
in the house enough?

362
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,720
I'm too good-looking
to be cooped up in the kitchen.

363
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,209
I'm not doing it.

364
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,220
Honey, cut off his allowance as of today.

365
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:09,209
What? What a harsh thing to say!
Are you giving me up as your child?

366
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,409
Then what about you?
Are you giving up on your life?

367
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,469
- Just eat, sleep, and shit all day?
- It's not just eat, sleep, and shit.

368
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,720
I eat, sleep, and shit like a champ.
Do you know how difficult that is?

369
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,969
I was even out clubbing all night.
I was very busy in my own right.

370
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,720
- Honey, don't even feed him.
- I'm still a growing boy.

371
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,910
How can you say such a thing
as my own dad?

372
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,669
Okay, fine. Fine, I hear you.

373
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,609
By the end of the year...

374
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,439
I'm not even talking next year,
because I'm not that type of a person.

375
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,000
I will give some major thought to what it
is that I want to do by the end of the year

376
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,139
so let's just keep my allowance flowing.
Let's both agree on that, okay?

377
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,439
- No.
- Come on, why not!

378
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,640
No, I don't want to waste any more money.

379
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,459
Then give me tuition money
so that I can go to school.

380
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,879
Okay, let me see your acceptance letter.

381
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,539
- Give me the money first.
- Get lost.

382
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,799
Come on, just give me my allowance!
Did I ask to be born?

383
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,919
I was brought into this world
because you two were horny one night!

384
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,759
- You disrespectful bastard!
- Give me my allowance!

385
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,460
- How am I supposed to live without money!
- Get your act together!

386
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,539
- Give me my money! I want money!
- The bastard!

387
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:32,120
Give me my allowance!
Father, please give me my allowance!

388
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,999
My baby is such a good eater.

389
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,259
- Let's break up.
- What now? Stop being so annoying.

390
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,159
I don't even have an income anymore,
and I can't date a poor girl like you.

391
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,679
Even though all I have to give you
right now is this pickled radish

392
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,359
but I still have a bright future ahead
of me when I finish college.

393
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,579
But the present is more important to me.

394
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,179
I'm going to find myself a sugar mama
at one of those bars.

395
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,059
You're not going to
screw yourself like that.

396
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,919
What makes you think that?

397
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,919
Because your parents are good people,
so you're not going to screw up.

398
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,539
But you don't have parents,
so how are you so good?

399
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,939
- Because I'm in love with you.
- That's a serious problem.

400
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,540
Thinking isn't your strong suit,
so just keep eating your food.

401
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,899
I have to get to class.

402
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,639
- Want a kiss?
- No.

403
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,520
Hey.

404
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,159
What do you think I should do?

405
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,719
Are you being serious
about this right now?

406
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,740
I'm going to go to a PC room.

407
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,650
I can't decide between playing
League of Legends or World of Warcraft.

408
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,360
A life or death decision then.

409
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,699
Try selling off your game items.

410
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,780
Wouldn't that keep you afloat
for a couple of months?

411
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,299
The increase in actual income
affects the demand.

412
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,089
If you look at the graph below...

413
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,780
Ah, they say that love
is an unwelcome visitor.

414
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,750
Can't even drive it away.

415
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,259
Hi Kyung Jae.

416
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,920
Hello!

417
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,510
She called me by my name.

418
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,240
Pardon me, Senior.

419
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,720
I'm interested in joining
the investment club.

420
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,389
Our club is seriously boring.

421
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,309
You have to invest more time
into it than you might think.

422
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,679
Investments should be made rationally.

423
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,109
Don't invest unless you understand it.

424
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,220
Oh, exactly.

425
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,540
Rational judgment...

426
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,240
Hey, are you okay...

427
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,690
Hi.

428
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

429
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,529
Do you know that professor?

430
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,949
What?

431
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,090
I recognized him because
I saw him on TV once.

432
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,449
But how do you...
I take his class.

433
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,740
Ah, I really wanted to
take his class!

434
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,970
Don't bother. He's full of shit.

435
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,250
He's smarmy too.

436
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,150
You know how to talk badly about people.

437
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,879
Kyung Jae.

438
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,139
I'm going to go for a drive right now.

439
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,280
I don't want to go alone.
Want to invest in some time with me?

440
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,089
If you can understand, that is.

441
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,359
Yes.

442
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,590
I think I'm beginning to understand.

443
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,129
Truthfully, I wasn't planning on
joining a club.

444
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,389
Why not?

445
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,690
I was afraid I'd dream about
becoming something else.

446
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,829
Something that might
burden my family.

447
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,839
Like becoming an artist.

448
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,670
So you try to prevent things
before they ever happen?

449
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,189
- You're scary.
- What?

450
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,320
No, I like neckties, too.

451
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,859
I'll buy you a tie when you get a job.

452
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,549
Whoa, that's a promise!

453
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,259
Let's toast to that promise...

454
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,889
Well, we should.
But then who will drive?

455
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,370
You drive.

456
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:24,059
I did get my license,
but I've haven't driven since then.

457
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,690
We'll just sleep over then.

458
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,780
I'll give it a go!

459
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,530
One should sleep at home.

460
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,939
You must have a good reason
to go home.

461
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,919
My boyfriend tends
to go home early too.

462
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,640
Is your boyfriend...
a gamer too?

463
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,680
You have to suck that like a man.

464
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,840
Anyway, it's nice that he's not here.

465
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,000
- You have to suck it.
- But...

466
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,840
Can't they keep it down?

467
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,669
They're a bit loud, aren't they?

468
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,309
Do what you did in the welcoming party.

Senior.

471
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,789
That wasn't me then.

Even if you were But
still, this a bit...

473
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,939
Then I'll do it.

474
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,449
The duty of the youth is
to challenge corruption.

475
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,519
Oh? You like Kurt Cobain?

476
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,030
Shut your fucking mouths!

You're not studying hard,

Would I? Who do you take me for?

That's right.

You've already done everything
you need to do. You're pretty.

Move over. I'll be late to work.

I'm so disappointed.

500
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,989
You loser. You nutjob.

501
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,219
She has a boyfriend.
You know I'm not that kind of guy.

502
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,739
As if that makes a difference.

503
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,019
What does that make me as a guy
who's taken and sleeps around?

504
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,399
You?

505
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,010
A tall son of a bitch.

506
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,379
It's not being a son of a bitch.

507
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,730
It's called being flexible.

508
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,239
Say she goes on social media
and posts what you did to her.

509
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,369
Then the girls will think,
'My word, there are gentlemen out there!'

510
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:24,699
Don't go and raise the bar
for the rest of us, please!

511
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,429
You were in the wrong, Kyung Jae.

512
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,809
You should have at least
gone to third base with her.

513
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,909
I said not to talk about her like that!
I like this girl!

514
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,129
Are you getting mad at me
over a girl right now?

515
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,820
- That's right.
- I'm sorry then.

516
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,950
He is kind of cute.

517
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,820
Oh, shit.

518
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,079
I want to sleep with her.

519
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,449
Watch how I hit on her.
Flexibility, okay?

520
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,669
Now what are you thinking of doing?

521
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,129
I told you not to do it
while I'm around.

522
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,980
She's really hot.

523
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,660
Oh my god! Shit!

524
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:16,339
What the fuck? You hit someone!

525
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,280
Are you insane?

526
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,240
The brake slipped!
I was only going to scare her!

527
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,390
Well, you succeeded.
You definitely scared her.

528
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,999
You said you were
going to sleep with her.

529
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,779
Go sleep with her.
She's already lying in bed.

530
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,340
I'm being serious right now.

531
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,559
Hey, you know that money
we've been saving for our trip?

532
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,049
I only saved 100,000 won!

533
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,399
You're useless.

534
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,479
What am I going to do then?

535
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,229
What else? You have to call home.

536
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,249
My parents are ready
to totally disown me.

537
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,169
They'll be so happy about this
that they'll throw me in jail.

538
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,309
Go on then.

539
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,009
It's not like you have
anything to do anyway.

540
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,700
Can you go instead?
I've got allergies.

541
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,279
Screw you. You go.

542
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,249
You're a son of a bitch.

543
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,000
Fuck!

544
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,750
Go and hit on her.
That was your intent anyway.

545
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,729
Wait... really? Hey.

546
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,260
You're really going to hit on her?

547
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,429
Does that work?

548
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,380
We're filming at night as it is.

549
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,039
Then get me a manager.

550
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,379
Do you know how awkward
it is going on set alone?

551
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,450
I'm going. I'll go.

552
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,150
- The flowers are in full bloom...
- Take the wheel.

553
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,729
Good morning, Director!
Assistant director.

554
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,999
- Who is she?
- She plays the girl that gets bullied.

555
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,979
Her name is Heo Eun Hye.

556
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,109
I'm rookie actress Heo Eun Hye.
Please take care of me.

557
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,019
- You have to make it look realistic.
- You can count on me!

558
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,870
I grew up getting smacked around.

559
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,000
Director Jo, I brought
my manager with me.

560
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,119
You had a manager?

561
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,259
Since the company said
I'll be busier from now on.

562
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,080
I see.

563
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,070
Your manager is quite handsome.

564
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,930
Goodness, I hope you
take good care of her.

565
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,999
We really have high hopes for her.

566
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,439
- Good to meet you, too.
- Yes, of course.

567
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,880
See you around.

568
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,029
They give you food
even if you do nothing?

569
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,900
Isn't waiting around
part of the job?

570
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,540
What are you going to do
about the settlement?

571
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,919
Want to go out for drinks
after filming wraps?

572
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,320
Don't mess with me.

573
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,170
- Give me three million won.
- I don't have it.

574
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,100
What is it that you do?

575
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:56,149
During the day... I'm sitting still.

576
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,029
And at night, I either go out drinking...

577
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,270
- You're unemployed.
- Yes.

578
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,590
- How old are you?
- 20 years old.

579
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,169
I have five days of filming left,
so you can be my manager.

580
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,939
Just follow me around
and I'll forget about the settlement.

581
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,420
You got that?

582
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,670
So I can just wait around
and eat the food?

583
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,010
Yes. And pretend like you're taking care
of me like that guy is over there.

584
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,520
That's easy.

585
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,860
When have we met that
you'd speak so politely?

586
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,280
We're the same age, so drop
the formalities when we're alone.

587
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,370
Eun Hye! We're getting ready to film!

588
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,390
- Hurry up!
- Yes, Director Jo!

589
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,920
I want to smack that face of hers.

590
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,819
- Stop moving around when I smack you!
- Cut!

591
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,139
- Good work, everyone!
- Are you okay?

592
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,229
Good work!

593
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,880
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

594
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,629
Hey, you can smack me
as hard as you want.

595
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,269
Okay, let's do another take.

596
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:04,079
Everyone get in position.
Let's get this rolling.

597
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,990
Ready...

598
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,150
Action!

599
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,360
I've brought some refreshments!
Here you go.

600
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,400
Here, this is for you.

601
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,699
- Okay!
- Okay.

602
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,640
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

603
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,609
- You really must have nothing else to do.
- Yeah.

604
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,990
- Forget it. Stop coming to the set.
- No, I'll come.

605
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:21,409
I'm not as sweet and innocent
as you think I am.

606
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,009
Don't develop any feelings for me.

607
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:26,910
What bullshit are you spewing now?
Who says I think you're sweet?

608
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:31,150
Whatever. Do what you want.

609
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,830
Okay!

610
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,290
Okay!

611
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,830
- Dong Woo, your tuition isn't in yet.
- Really?

612
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,449
I don't know how that could've happened.
It'll be in next week.

613
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,570
Okay. Why are you crouched on the floor?

614
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,690
I'm having sympathy for the poor.

615
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,830
[GOOD JOB AT SCHOOL TODAY.
I'M ON MY WAY HOME AFTER CLASS MYSELF.]

616
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:18,249
[YEAH, I'M ON THE BUS.
I'LL TEXT YOU BEFORE I GO TO BED.]

617
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,609
Just send her the smiley face!
Why are you hesitating about it?

618
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:23,550
Do you mind?

619
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,330
You're embarrassing me.

620
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,069
- Are you two finally dating?
- No, we're not dating.

621
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,909
If you're texting each other before bed,
then that means you're dating.

622
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,249
Kyung Jae and I text each other
before bed, too.

623
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,109
Why are you dating my brother?
Which one of you is the girl?

624
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,970
Forget it. Let's just forget it.

625
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,889
- Dear brother, you're home.
- Yeah.

626
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:59,370
- What brings you by here?
- Mom wanted me to bring you some food.

627
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,989
She's afraid that
her precious son might starve.

628
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,149
If she's that worried,
then she shouldn't touch my bank account.

629
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,590
She needed some things for the twins,
and she had no other choice.

630
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:12,269
Mom bawled her eyes out
after taking your money.

631
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:16,809
I know that mom's a bit thoughtless,
but knowing her situation

632
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,950
shouldn't you have at least checked
to make sure everything's okay with her?

633
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,329
But I guess...

634
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:24,389
your comics are more important
to you than Mom is, isn't it?

635
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,189
- Hey, you know that's not true.
- Yes, it is.

636
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:30,509
It's been years since our family's been
in the dumps after Dad was taken away.

637
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,989
It's not like you need a college degree
to draw your comics.

638
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,089
That's true.

639
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:39,790
But I fear that if I give up now,
then I'll never get another chance.

640
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,189
It's not like I'm telling you
to give up college.

641
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,669
I'm sorry, I know you need
to go to college, too.

642
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,969
I'm going to go to military school.

643
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,689
Mom wants me to go to law school,
but that's just crap.

644
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:53,910
If I left, then who will look after her?

645
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:05,090
[MIN JUNG: ARE YOU ASLEEP?]

646
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:23,010
Um... I have a question that
I'd like to ask you.

647
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,949
Sure, what is it?

648
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,270
How does one become a movie director?

649
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:34,029
You have to shoot a movie.
Then you're a movie director.

650
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,410
How does one shoot a movie?

651
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:41,700
Actors start acting,
and I capture it on film.

652
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:45,409
If I don't capture it,
then the film director captures it.

653
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,429
Then I just sit here and say, "Okay."
But if something seems off about it,

654
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,890
then I shout out for another take.

655
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,700
Do some bullshit like that,
and you have yourself a movie.

656
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:02,630
- It sounds like a very stressful job.
- You actually understood that?

657
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,720
Director, we need you over here.
Please come.

658
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,900
Okay.

659
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,260
Why ask?
Do you want to make a movie?

660
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,360
- Well...
- Don't. It's too much work.

661
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,319
You have a nice body.
You should just be a model.

662
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,799
No, don't do that either.
It's too hard.

663
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,199
Just get into business.
No, not that either. It's too hard.

664
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,419
Running a small business is too tough.
If you can, just become a rich tycoon.

665
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,699
The government is nice to rich tycoons.

666
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,279
Just do that. Then you can marry
pretty actresses, too.

667
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,519
And if things don't work out,
get divorced and get remarried.

668
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,979
Get remarried as often as you want.
Doesn't that sound good?

669
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,459
Director!
I asked you to come here!

670
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,679
Can't you see that I'm on my way?

671
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,920
I'm on my way... over to you.

672
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,909
That jerk is such an asshole.

673
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,059
He's always ordering me around.

674
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,290
He thinks he's the director.

675
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,339
- Director, what took you so long?
- I didn't hear you.

676
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,190
Then why did you answer me?

677
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:12,980
There he goes again.
Please get up.

678
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:16,150
Get up.

679
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,020
- What do you want me to take a look at?
- Come this way.

680
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,360
He's so awesome.

681
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:29,450
That was so beautiful.

[CEO KIM: CLUB ROSE IN CHEONGDAM-DONG,
NEXT WEDNESDAY AT 9 P.M.]

683
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,300
Investment is all about analysis.

684
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,939
Jin Joo's boyfriend
rarely calls or texts her.

685
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,019
Outside of her class, she spends
most of her free time in the club room.

686
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,059
Which means, she spends
most of her free time with me.

687
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:22,280
We have a similar food preferences.
Which means, we eat our meals together.

688
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:29,940
She likes comedic movies, like me.
Meaning, we go to the movies together.

689
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:34,959
Hormones created by feelings of
being in love doesn't last very long.

690
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,979
It only lasts for about 30 months.

691
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,360
Jin Joo, how long have you been
with your boyfriend?

692
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:43,010
We've been dating for about two years.
Why do you ask?

693
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,379
Thanks.

694
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,159
You need to judge rationally.

695
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,200
Never invest in something
which you don't understand.

696
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,039
But this... I understand.

697
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,840
I'm going to invest all my heart
into the love that's budding for her.

698
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,820
- Jin Joo.
- Yeah?

699
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,420
I want to rub my dick all over your ass.

700
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,260
This coffee smells great.

701
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:39,530
What's so funny?

702
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:43,069
Oh... I'm so sorry!

703
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,700
I'm so very sorry.

704
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,250
I'm... I'm so sorry.

705
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,180
Crazy bastard!

706
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,260
- I'm so sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

707
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,659

708
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,320
- Dong Woo!
- Dong Woo!

709
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,420
- Chicken!
- Chicken!

710
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,460
Mom! He's brought us chicken!

711
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,730
Mom, have you been smoking?

712
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,760
It's the best remedy for stress.

713
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,540
- Don't eat like street beggars.
- Don't scold them while they're eating.

714
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,810
Why aren't you eating any?

715
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,529
I'm sick of chicken. You eat.

716
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,980
I like duck better.
Next time, bring me some duck.

717
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,199
Mom, why did you have so many kids?

718
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,179
When you were born, you looked so much
like your father, and I didn't like it.

719
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,609
Then when Dong Won was born

720
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:56,000
he looked so much like me, and I loved it.

721
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,719
But... I really wanted a pretty daughter.

722
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,290
So, that's why I got pregnant again.

723
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,649
- But I never thought...
- Stop listening, and just eat.

724
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:11,929
Your father going bankrupt was
what stopped me from having another one.

725
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,689
Maybe it was a blessing in disguise.

726
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:18,250
I still find a small sliver of joy even
in the midst of that unfortunate story.

727
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:27,090
- Stop laughing like a street beggar.
- Don't scold them while they're laughing.

728
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:42,910
What the hell?

729
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:48,130
Did you snoop through my messages?
Asshole.

730
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:51,729
What the hell are you doing?
What?

731
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,830
Who the hell do you think you are?

732
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:58,030
Are there any gigs for me, too?
With rich old ladies?

733
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:33,129
- Why didn't you stop me?
- Why would I?

734
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,150
It's not like you're going to
be supporting me.

735
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,450
Are you crying?

736
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,310
Stop crying just because
you're struggling.

737
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,270
I've got enough to deal with already.

738
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,970
But she sure looks pretty
when she cries.

739
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,550
That's a real rarity.

740
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,810
Hey, what's with that strange
expression on your face?

741
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,149
I've never seen you look
at a girl like that before.

742
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,419
Like what?

743
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,719
Like you're thinking
with your heart...

744
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,969
rather than with your dick.

745
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,989
Like you want to hold her,
rather than just bang her.

746
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:29,789
Right?

747
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,710
But...

748
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,610
You're wrong.

749
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:00,530
Wow... I wonder if all this is
going to disappear, too.

750
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:05,009
That's just the way of life.

751
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:07,799
Easy for you to say since you never
take anything in life seriously.

752
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,000
- Is there a new girl in your life?
- Yeah, the one from the other day.

753
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,479
That's going to make things
awkward with So Min.

754
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,659
I've got nothing to hide.

755
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,859
So Min is my girlfriend,
while I'm just dating the other one.

756
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:21,579
- What does dating mean to you?
- Having sex whenever we're together.

757
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,739
- Then how about a girlfriend?
- Someone I see when I want to have sex.

758
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:29,119
- That strangely makes sense to me.
- Then... what does it mean to be in love?

759
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,939
- Doing it multiple times a day.
- Ah...

760
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:36,040
Crap, this sucks.
I actually understand his logic.

762
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,859
- What are you about to do?
- I wasn't going to do anything.

763
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:55,119
- I should teach you a lesson, asshole.
- Damn asshole.

764
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,100
So Joong, we're here.

765
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,040
Just look at you.

766
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,299
You're so damn pretty.

00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,140

- Should I draw a mole on my nose?
- Why?

781
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,360
Because they're pretty.
Just look at Han Ga In and Go So Young.

782

Then you'll look like

783

You should draw one in
the middle of your forehead.

A really big one.

- "How? By seducing my father?"

That's how you're going to say it?

01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:05,169
Are you asking me for my permission
to have you destroy me?

793
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:08,009
You have to be more vicious.
You sound way too meek.

01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:09,969

bat-shit crazy on me.

what's with the sudden accent?

No, I'm talking about me.
I'm going crazy from all the cuteness!

That's right, asshole, I'm her pimp.

Fine.

Who am I?

818
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,159
You're asking me who I am?

819
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,920
I don't deserve to hear you
talk to me that way.

820
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:27,860
You have a girlfriend,
you moronic asshole.

821
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,670
I told you that it was no big deal.
Why did you rush over here like that?

822
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:50,609
She collapsed and that's not a big deal?

823
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:52,849
You should've called me right away.

824
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:55,749
- I ran over here like a lunatic.
- What was that going to do?

825
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,550
Were you going to call the hospital,
and take care of matters yourself?

826
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,950

01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:10,089

829
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:13,830

- I..
- It's not manual labor.

01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:28,679
If you can learn the business...

834
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,680
then I plan on passing the factory
down to you once I retire.

835
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,959
All I have is a daughter
who now lives overseas.

836
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,540
Don't you want to send
Dong Won away to college?

837
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:42,720
He can be a judge or a prosecutor.
Don't you want that for him?

838
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:47,549
- You can do the cartoon thing as a hobby.
- I've already paid for my tuition.

839
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,940
- Give me some time to think about it.
- There's no time to think about it.

840
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:56,720
I know that you guys don't like me.

841
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,169
But do you think I wanted
for your father to end up that way?

842
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:05,359
Had I gone down with him,
then who would've taken care of the family?

843
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,480
And... even your father
doesn't resent me for what happened.

844
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,379
- Where are you off to?
- To the same lecture that you're going to.

845
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:26,400
I told you not to go to that lecture.

846
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:33,979
Like the hymen of a virgin,
once torn, it cannot be repaired.

847
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,599
You'll have to live with it
for the rest of your life

848
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,560
but will you still do it?

849
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:46,160
Even though it's a one-sided crush,
I will continue to love her in silence.

850
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:53,500
So that whenever she does become mine,
I won't be too flustered by it.

851
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,559
Did you think that I'd send the two
of you off together with a smile?

852
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,419
Did you really think that I'd do that?

853
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,139
Did you...

854
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:41,630
Did you really think I'd do that?

855
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:15,389
I'm not sure if it's wrong of me
to think like this right now

856
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:19,990
but I can't help but think that
I'm better off than she is right now.

857
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:43,660
Please delete what you just recorded.

858
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,960
Please, I beg of you. Delete...

859
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,620
what you just recorded.

860
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:00,070
Please, I beg of you.

861
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:18,369
- Have you guys not eaten yet?
- We have!

862
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:20,450
Then eat slower.

863
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:25,139
- Why are you faulting how they're eating?
- Because there's nothing for you to eat.

864
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:28,099
- You should eat, too.
- I already ate.

865
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,839
But you should still eat.
I'll go out and get more.

866
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,799
It's okay, I like chicken better.

867
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,550
Why do you keep changing your mind?
I used up all the money I had to buy that!

868
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,139
Duck is expensive!
It's more expensive than chicken!

869
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,880
I bought it for you, so have some!

870
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,730
Why are you two crying,
you little bastards? Huh?

871
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,889
What are you two crying about
like little dimwits?

872
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,209
You two even cry the same
like a pair of little shits.

873
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:53,550
That's enough.
I want you to leave. Leave!

874
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,090
It's okay, go on and eat.

875
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:23,229
Yeah.

876
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:27,710
Are you out of bed?
I'm out front. Let's grab lunch.

877
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:33,350
You there?

878
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,770
Come on up. I'll make you lunch.

879
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:51,839
My dad is a chef,
and I even went to a culinary school.

880
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:55,400
- So this is the least I can do.
- You quit your school after only one day.

881
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,340
Let's break up.

882
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,640
What now?

883
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,120
How can it end so quickly like that?

884
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:44,260
It was over by the time
my instant noodle finished cooking.

885
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,820
How could that have been the end of it?

886
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:58,589
There are so many awful men
out there in this world.

887
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:59,949
Ironically enough

888
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:03,749
countless number of women get
their hearts broken from loving these men.

889
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,429
Then there are those men

890
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:10,229
who are there to console, and only
to console those heartbroken women.

891
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:14,210
Those are the good guys,
or shall I say, brainless idiots?

892
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,180
And I'm one of them.

893
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:33,729
Jin Joo left for the land of the cold
with the man she loved.

894
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:38,060
But I'm sure she's receiving warmer
treatment there than she would here.

895
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:45,550
Right here... it aches right here.
Do you know what that feels like?

896
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,250
Take a look, So Joong.

897
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,959
- Isn't my chest all red?
- It's because you've been rubbing it.

898
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,969
- For you. Can I get you anything else?
- Piss off. I'm still upset.

899
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:58,119
Hey, I saw that video clip,
and that professor's wife is hot.

900
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,579
There, you should just date her instead.
It'll be an even trade.

901
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:03,789
- Since the wife is hot, too.
- Yeah.

902
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:06,900
- She's hot? Show me.
- Yeah, want to see?

903
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:10,299
- Look at how many 'likes' she got.
- Yeah, she's nice.

904
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,040
What are they doing?

905
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,579
Hey, Kim Kyung Jae.
You know what the saddest part is?

906
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:20,239
It's not about your failed crush,
but it's that those are your friends.

907
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,020
- She really is pretty.
- Put that away!

908
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,739
You really are wise.

909
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,919
It must be the fancy education
that you're getting from college.

910
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,879
- Want a drink?
- I quit drinking.

911
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:35,779
Just how old do you have to be before
you stop feeling the agonies of love?

912
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,419
- Does it get better at your age?
- No.

913
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:42,159
An older friend of mine came by last night,
and he ended up crying into his drink.

914
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,200
- How old is he?
- 49.

915
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:52,289
Women and our dating lives
are what we're all worried about?

916
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:55,069
What an insignificant thing to worry about
at the turning point of our lives.

917
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,970
Let's be adults about this, okay?

918
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,819
- You should commit suicide tonight.
- What?

919
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:05,039
I've been watching a lot of movies lately,
and teens are always committing suicide.

920
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,319
You should commit suicide.

921
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,199
Then it'll give us something
more serious to worry about.

922
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:13,239
- But I get paid tomorrow.
- Oh, then that won't work.

923
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,740
Then how about an abortion?

924
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,839
But someone needs to be pregnant first.
Hey, go out and get yourself pregnant.

925
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,799
- By whose sperm?
- Who cares? Be impulsive about it.

926
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,320
- I'm on my period.
- Shit.

927
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:29,079
How about drugs? Let's do drugs.

928
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,660
That costs money.
We don't have money to do that.

929
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:41,160
So this must be why
soju manufacturers are so profitable.

930
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,480
Then...

931
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:52,579
- Let's have sex.
- It's about time those words came out.

932
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:56,260
I say this with the honor
of my name on the line...

933
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,719
If you guys don't have
sex again this year

934
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:04,140
then forget about being monsters, you'll
turn into one of those dirty politicians.

935
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,279
Then let's be adults about it,
and go to one of those seedy bars.

936
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,319
Fine, go.
Go, you pathetic losers.

937
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,839
- Just go.
- This is going against our principles.

938
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,879
- Are you sure about this?
- I'm sure!

939
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,999
- Let's go! Come on!
- Are you sure about this?

940
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,969
- We're sure!
- We're sure!

941
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:29,980
- We're sure!
- Yeah!

942
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:43,999
[IS IT OKAY TO TOUCH THIS GIRL'S TITS?]

943
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,659
[I'VE BEEN PONDERING ABOUT THAT MYSELF.]

944
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,739
[IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO HESITATE.]

945
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:54,400
[I'VE NEVER HAD TO PAY FOR TITS BEFORE.
I'LL GO FOR IT FIRST.]

946
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,489
The first pair of tits I've ever touched

947
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:24,209
were the fake padded bra
of some nameless girl I barely knew.

948
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:26,549
My first pair of tits were...

949
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:32,129
a cheap padded bra that was made up of
polyester, polyurethane, and cotton.

950
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:35,730
And that's where I blacked out.

951
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:41,769
- Kyung Jae!
- Kyung Jae!

952
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:47,760
You moron!
Why are you freaking out at the bar?

953
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,850
You're a moronic asshole!

954
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:02,840
- You're such an idiotic asshole!
- Stop hitting Kyung Jae!

955
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:24,580
Hey, what's college got to do
with becoming a movie director?

956
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,339
- Well... But still.
- Shut up.

957
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,929
Our country is so screwed up these days.

958
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:34,079
You have to be good at math in order to
get into a good college, right?

959
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,670
Isn't that how the system works?

960
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,659
But what bullshit is that?
It's so screwed up.

961
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,729
- You're bad at math, aren't you?
- I'm horrible at it.

962
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,109
Shit.

963
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:45,629
It's a screwed up system where kids
like you are forced to become losers.

964
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:48,209
It's like you're worthless
just because you suck at math

965
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:52,389
and you're made to believe you're unworthy
before you even attempt anything.

966
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:56,649
This is all because of those
shitheads that runs our government.

967
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:59,669
They pay for their own kids to receive
expensive tutoring lessons.

968
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:01,309
They're all assholes and shitheads.

969
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:04,670
All they care about is
finding ways for them to get richer.

970
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,569
Screw math!

971
01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:09,509
It's not like we have to do
factoring problems before we eat.

972
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:13,869
That's why I've been thinking about
writing a screenplay of my own.

973
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:18,329
- Like practice of some sorts.
- Good, and be confident about it.

974
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:22,109
It's an idea that I gave to an
aspiring comic artist friend of mine.

975
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:25,390
- Would you like to hear what it is?
- Yeah, sounds good. Go for it.

976
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:27,809
The title is...

977
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:30,230
Invasion of the Planet Penis.

978
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:36,650
Penis... as in...

979
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:43,210
Ah... penis?

980
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:46,149
Okay, go on.

981
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:51,349
It takes place in two million B.C.
Towards the end of Caenozoic era.

982
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:56,049
The story begins with a theory that
the males didn't have dicks back then.

983
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:58,369
- They don't have dicks?
- Meanwhile...

984
01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:00,869
The aliens of Planet Penis

985
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:04,639
foresaw the fate of their own extinction
in the far distant future

986
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,929
and infiltrated the Earth to plant
themselves as the dicks on the males.

987
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:09,369
Interesting.

988
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:12,109
The bigger aliens
ended up going to Africa.

989
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:16,249
- Damn! They should've came here instead.
- No shit.

990
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,589
Anyway, those aliens end up going back.

991
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:22,449
But since, the males viewed their
newly given dicks as a symbol of pride

992
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,469
and went around boasting their dicks

993
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:28,390
until... they started evolving
to what we are today.

994
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:33,130
Our dicks are aliens.

995
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:36,399
Mine is suddenly
starting to feel strange.

996
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,619
You're sucked into the story, aren't you?

997
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:41,299
Since then, men became obsessed with sex,
and they kept on doing it.

998
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,499
They couldn't stop!

999
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,879
After centuries of peace
living that way.

1000
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,839
The aliens of Planet Penis
are in danger of extinction

1001
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,919
just like their ancestors foretold.

1002
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,320
Their birthrate plummeted.

1003
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,729
So they end up invading Earth
to retrieve their comrades?

1004
01:19:58,730 --> 01:19:59,769
Bingo!

1005
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:01,389
It's not really retrieving.

1006
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:03,730
Technically, they came to reclaim
what was already theirs.

1007
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:08,450
But would you hand over your dick
if they asked for it back?

1008
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:11,649
- I'd rather die.
- Right?

1009
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:13,579
Intergalactic war.

1010
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:17,000
Humanity's battle against
Planet Penis to protect their dicks.

1011
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:19,809
And then women are more aggressive.

1012
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:20,899
That's right!

1013
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,599
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1014
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,420
Bravo. You're a fucking genius!

1015
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:27,049
Totally crazy.
Don't do math and don't go to college.

1016
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:28,220
Bravo!

1017
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,439
But the production cost
would be incredibly high...

1018
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,159
I need to take a leak.

1019
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,590
Don't do movies.
You'll get depression.

1020
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:04,030
Hold onto me.

1021
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,219
- Dong Woo.
- Yeah?

1022
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:17,970
When will life cease to be exhausting?

1023
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,620
Do I look like someone
who can answer that for you?

1024
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:24,680
Point taken.

1025
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:32,350
It's a present. Cheer up.

1026
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:34,479
[FREE CHICKEN COUPON]

1027
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,470
- Oh, coupons.
- 10 coupons.

1028
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:40,020
You have to mention it
before you order.

1029
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,330
How precious.

1030
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,149
What?

1031
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:05,449
- Go on.
- Hmm?

1032
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:06,989
Keep walking.

1033
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:10,310
- Why?
- Just keep walking, huh?

1034
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:20,099
Stop!

1035
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,040
Don't turn around!

1036
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:35,349
I'm not doing this
because I'm tired

1037
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,150
and I'm not doing this
because of the coupons.

1038
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:40,869
You've noticed that I like you.

1039
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:43,079
Why pretend like you don't know
when you already do?

1040
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,600
So rude.

1041
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,800
How come you smell this nice?

1042
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:52,770
You said you're broke
but you use fabric softener?

1043
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:57,459
Well... I have sensitive skin.

1044
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:58,970
Don't lose another good girl.

1045
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,050
Jeez.

1046
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,699
You think I'm out of shape
because I'm a senior, right?

1047
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:15,219
No, I've been sticking to a strict diet
and kept up an exercise regimen.

1048
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:16,599
I'm as busty as can be.

1049
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,090
They're totally firm.

1050
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,519
I've discovered a commonality
between bad guys and soju.

1051
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,410
You have way too much
free time on your hands.

1052
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:42,079
Soju might taste bitter...

1053
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:46,029
but then there's a slightly sweet
aftertaste once you swallow it.

1054
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:48,599
- Is that right?
- That sweetness is addictive.

1055
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,410
It's the same with bad guys.

1056
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:53,589
If they treat you nicely on occasion
after treating you horribly

1057
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:57,309
then the girl become an addict
to that hint of a sweet side.

1058
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:00,399
You make it sound like
I only date bad guys.

1059
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,379
Bad and worthless guys.

1060
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:05,409
I get that you're passionate
about social welfare.

1061
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:06,830
I totally get it...

1062
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:10,549
but you shouldn't approach men
with that kind of attitude.

1063
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:12,609
I guess I do tend to do that.

1064
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:17,079
Despite my words of advice,
I'm going to be an asshole from now on.

1065
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,689
A bad guy can usually deceive others
into thinking that he's a nice guy.

1066
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:22,089
But when a nice guy
tries to be an asshole...

1067
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,639
It's a bit lacking.

1068
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,989
He could end up looking like an idiot.

1069
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:29,459
Am I considered a nice guy type then?

1070
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,949
To put it nicely, yes.

1071
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:32,340
To be more blunt, a pushover.

1072
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:35,499
An idiot who lets the girl he loves
slip away without saying a word.

1073
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,259
An idiot.

1074
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:40,449
- I just got her off my mind.
- Nobody forgets their first love.

1075
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,579
What are you talking about?
She's not my first love.

1076
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,010
That's you.

1077
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,130
Say that again.

1078
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:13,009
So that I can apologize
for not hearing you correctly.

1079
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:14,979
I got a sugar daddy.

1080
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:17,180
Should I tell you who he is?

1081
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:21,530
I'll be modeling for his company, too.

1082
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,460
Fuck, she's so blunt about it.

1083
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:39,579
I'm breaking up with you right now.

1084
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:43,840
Although there isn't the slightest chance
that I'll ever take you back

1085
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,010
but know this if you aren't dumb.

1086
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,330
I fucking loved you.

1087
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:00,579
You'll probably never meet someone
who loves you as much as I did.

1088
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:04,070
I'm letting you know so you can
regret it sometime in the future.

1089
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:09,100
How much could you have
possibly loved me?

1090
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,790
How many days has he been
sitting there like that?

1091
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,080
He's less of a worry
when he isn't off doing something.

1092
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:48,269
- Wrong!
- Oh my goodness!

1093
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:50,159
He's gone nuts.

1094
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,990
That's enough.

1095
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,240
[I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
MEET ME AT SOH SOH AT 3 P.M.]

1096
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:23,970
I think... I'm nervous.

1097
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:27,560
I'll do the talking.

1098
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:31,680
It's not like we've done
anything wrong.

1099
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:47,459
You startled me.

1100
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:48,869
What a moron.

1101
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:50,730
Hey, Kim Kyung Jae!

1102
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:54,170
Are you lonely lately?
Why are you two holding hands?

1103
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:05,290
We're dating.

1104
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:06,530
It's been some time.

1105
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:09,100
So what?

1106
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,050
Have you slept together?

1107
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,580
This is hilarious.

1108
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:24,550
Fucking hilarious.

1109
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:28,580
Hey, where are you going?

1110
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:33,980
Isn't this what you were
going to tell me?

1111
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:36,220
I've heard you loud and clear,
so I'm leaving.

1112
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:40,470
You don't look okay...
Lash out at me if you want.

1113
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:44,720
I've got some personal issues
going on.

1114
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,130
Hey, I think it'll be awkward
if you leave now.

1115
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:49,559
What's with you guys?

1116
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,040
What am I supposed to do?
They're the ones dating each other.

1117
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:52,439
What the fuck? Want my blessing?

1118
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,239
Why are you cursing, you punk?

1119
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,109
Why are you talking as if
you're never going to see him again?

1120
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:58,090
I said I've got my own
personal issues.

1121
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,730
And it's really strange.
That's not weird to you?

1122
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:07,440
Let go of me.

1123
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:17,220
It's fine with me.
You have my blessing.

1124
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,090
Just keep holding hands.
You already are...

1125
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,359
Give him some time.

1126
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,540
All right, let's laugh it off.

1127
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,079
Goodness.

1128
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,689
A week on the couch.
Another in bed.

1129
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:42,139
Can't you at least change
positions from time to time?

1130
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,209
You'll get bed sores.

1131
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:46,509
- Dad!
- What the heck.

1132
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:48,910
- What's with girls?
- What, you punk?

1133
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:53,059
- They're messed up.
- Your room is more messed up.

1134
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:54,939
Clean your room, you punk!

1135
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:57,759
Jeez, my head hurts!

1136
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,060
My goodness.

1137
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,799
Get up, get up, you rascals!

1138
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,089
Time to go to school!

1139
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:17,859
Come here.

1140
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:23,639
- No!
- One, two... We can sleep in today!

1141
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,710
- Why?
- It's college entrance exam day!

1142
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:30,090
Get up since you're up.
Have breakfast.

1143
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:37,819
[GOOD LUCK ON YOUR EXAM. YOU BETTER
GIVE ME AN ANSWER ONCE IT'S OVER, ]

1144
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:39,180
[IF IT'S A NO, I'LL KILL YOU.]

1145
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:44,720
- Leaving?
- I should.

1146
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,349
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1147
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:50,240
Should I move back in with you guys?

1148
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:52,759
There's no room for you.

1149
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,639
Seriously. How can you be so fickle?

1150
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,379
You told me to move back in last time.

1151
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:00,149
Beautiful women are like that.

1152
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:02,170
You've seen what I looked like
when I was younger, right?

1153
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:04,540
I wasn't going to say this

1154
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:07,410
but I was much prettier than
in those pictures.

1155
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:10,870
Good for you.

1156
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:14,750
I've decided to work for
Uncle's company.

1157
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:17,959
I'm sorry.

1158
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,400
I should have made that decision
for the sake of the family...

1159
01:31:20,990 --> 01:31:23,090
But I decided to because of a girl.

1160
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,660
Ah, there's someone I like, Mom.

1161
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:31,429
She's incredibly pretty.

1162
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:33,920
Almost as pretty as you are.

1163
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:38,170
- Why would someone like that...
- Come on.

1164
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:41,250
You married Dad.

1165
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:45,140
- Because he had a lot of money.
- Hey, seriously.

1166
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,090
I'm leaving.

1167
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:52,959
Eat before you go.

1168
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,929
Your cooking is terrible.

1169
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:57,270
Why else would the twins
be hungry all the time?

1170
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:03,850
It's because pretty women can't cook.

1171
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,290
I guess she must've smelled the food.

1172
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:10,450
Hey So Hee! How did your exam go?

1173
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:13,829
Kyung Jae! Where's Dong Woo right now?

1174
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:16,859
Huh? I don't know, after his exam...

1175
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:18,289
He didn't take the exam!

1176
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:20,199
I heard he quit his part-time job
and the art academy too!

1177
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,719
He isn't picking up either.
You don't know where he's gone?

1178
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:23,509
Where is he?

1179
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:25,090
What are you talking about?

1180
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,559
How would you like your hair cut?

1181
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:30,219
Like an office employee, please.

1182
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,780
Pardon?

1183
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:35,700
Like a real office employee.

1184
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:49,069
What the hell?
What's wrong with you?

1185
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:52,520
- Did your exam go well?
- What are you doing?

1186
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,310
And what's with your hair?

1187
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:29,439
Hey, you crazy bastard.

1188
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,219
You're broke? Is that it?

1189
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:33,449
You need money?

1190
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:35,179
Here.

1191
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:38,440
Hey, here's some money,
you crazy bastard!

1192
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,599
What's with your hair?

1193
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,469
Stop making a fuss and take a seat.

1194
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:46,309
Who's making a fuss around here?

1195
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:49,669
Why put up with everything for a year
if you were going to quit like that?

1196
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:51,230
Stop it!

1197
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:55,969
Why are you making
such a big deal?

1198
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:58,799
Why should I be criticized
for giving up?

1199
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,819
What's the big deal about the world?

1200
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:02,760
You think it's full of winners like
Kim Yuna and Park Tae Hwan?

1201
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:05,579
So do all the quitters have
to be criticized for doing so?

1202
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:07,550
What? What?

1203
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:11,030
Do you even know
how hard it is to give up?

1204
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:19,949
Who said I wasn't going to college?

1205
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:22,300
I'll take the job route first.

1206
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:24,610
I'll learn the business
and earn some money...

1207
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:27,729
You think this opportunity
comes up every day?

1208
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:30,540
Comics...

1209
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,580
Comics...

1210
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,060
Comics can...

1211
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:49,180
The tears won't come.

1212
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:57,100
It's not really something
you can cry about.

1213
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,799
I can always find a way
to draw on my own...

1214
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:06,530
It's true. It's not like my parents
died or something.

1215
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:09,799
It's not like we lost our country either.

1216
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,270
I guess it's not really
something to cry over.

1217
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:15,840
Anyway, you're back, Cha Chi Ho.

1218
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,399
Hey, you two.

1219
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,549
Don't have sex in front of me.

1220
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:23,619
What kind of nonsense is that, man?

1221
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:25,649
- Don't get pregnant either.
- Come on.

1222
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:27,799
Don't even look happy together.
I got dumped.

1223
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,079
- She dumped you?
- Big fucking time.

1224
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,729
And... fuck.

1225
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:36,659
What's really pathetic...
is that I'm heartbroken.

1226
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:39,710
Seeing you three together
reminds me of something.

1227
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:44,859
That it's much scarier
when you three idiots are together.

1228
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:46,349
Pour me a shot, too.

1229
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:47,419
- No!
- No!

1230
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:49,809
You guys started drinking during
your first year of high school!

1231
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,599
I've lived a decent life for 19 years
and I can't have a shot?

1232
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,959
- No.
- No way.

1233
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,410
Absolutely not.

1234
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:03,329
Why does it feel so... empty?

1235
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:07,309
People keep saying that
we're living the best years of our lives

1236
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:09,419
are they just talking about our skin?

1237
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:11,199
Life is definitely hard and frustrating

1238
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,600
but I can't go and bitch about it
or I get criticized for it.

1239
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,259
It just feels so empty.

1240
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:17,389
What's so empty for you?

1241
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:19,129
At least you're screwing
your best friend's ex.

1242
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:21,009
Hey, you son of a bitch.
You want to say that?

1243
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:22,549
What? I can say whatever I want.

1244
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:23,809
So annoying.

1245
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:25,990
I'm only letting you off today
because of Dong Woo?

1246
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,559
What's so special about today?
Don't go out of your way for me.

1247
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,689
I don't want your pity.

1248
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:31,009
You guys are so annoying.

1249
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:33,630
This celebration turned into
a pity party for you.

1250
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,739
What's with the big talk?

1251
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,589
Come to think of it,
you're the biggest idiot.

1252
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:38,649
You think you can take me?

1253
01:36:38,650 --> 01:36:40,090
- Idiots.
- Fuck you.

1254
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:41,579
At least I'm not screwing
my best friend's ex.

1255
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,029
Are you trying to make
a catchphrase out of that?

1256
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:45,380
Shut up. You're screwing
your ex's best friend.

1257
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:46,999
You crazy son of a bitch.

1258
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,719
You've gone too far, moron.

1259
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,659
They're the ones screwing around.
Why yell at me?

1260
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:52,399
Will you stop using that word?

1261
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,189
See? They're so superficial.

1262
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:56,599
- What did you say?
- Great! This is just great.

1263
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,319
Great? You're no better
because you're screwing his ex.

1264
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:00,979
Stop saying that word, you ass!

1265
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:04,009
Stop it! At least my brother
isn't masturbating anymore.

1266
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:05,220
- Hey!
- Hey!

1267
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,150
Boss, we're back!

1268
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:15,410
Get back. Get back!

1269
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:21,630
Don't do that!

1270
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:27,869
I'm usually not such a bad person.
It's just a part of my job.

1271
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:29,549
I have to threaten people every day...

1272
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:31,010
I have to destroy things too.

1273
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:33,229
But what can I do?
I've got growing kids at home

1274
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:34,839
and it's tough to get a job
in this economy.

1275
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:37,049
Get out before I call the cops.

1276
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:38,929
Get the hell out, you thugs!

1277
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:41,349
Oh, how sexy.

1278
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:42,889
Stay inside.

1279
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,779
Let's take this outside.

1280
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:48,309
I came here to do my job,
and she keeps telling me to leave.

1281
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:50,510
Let's do this then.

1282
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,999
I've got a crush on your wife.

1283
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,379
She's hot!

1284
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,379
I'd like to go out with her sometime.

1285
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:58,800
I'm not saying you should
just give her to me.

1286
01:37:58,810 --> 01:38:02,569
I'm asking for a fair shot
at competing against you.

1287
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:06,830
I'll write off your interest
and leave your business alone.

1288
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:10,060
I can't give you
a better offer than that.

1289
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,869
Honey.

1290
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:15,389
Let's get out of here.

1291
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,550
Let's just go, okay?

1292
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,370
Stay inside.

1293
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:22,820
- Honey...
- I said stay inside!

1294
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:42,479
A fourth-degree black belt in Taekwondo
and martial arts master

1295
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,870
and a former Navy Seal.

1296
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:47,340
A man with an iron fist
from kneading dough.

1297
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:51,029
This man who's been keeping
his wild instincts in check for his family.

1298
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:53,980
He's... about to explode.

1299
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:57,199
But I've been so timely
with paying off the interest.

1300
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,529
Please stop with your destruction.

1301
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:01,509
My father invested his whole life
into this restaurant.

1302
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:05,250
I can't just leave like this. Please.

1303
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:09,309
This jackass. You scared me.

1304
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:12,800
- You startled me!
- The duty of the youth...

1305
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:16,530
is to challenge corruption.

1306
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:19,109
Wreck the place.

1307
01:39:19,110 --> 01:39:20,399
Destroy it!

1308
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,020
Shut your fucking mouth, you fuck!

1309
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:28,679
Leave him alone!

1310
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:32,280
Leave them alone
and let them stay here!

1311
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:55,120
I regretted it as soon as I took off.

1312
01:39:59,590 --> 01:40:01,470
I was going to stop him.

1313
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:08,940
Ditto.

1314
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:13,369
Power and greed were greater than our will.

1315
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:16,529
But our feats won't be forgotten.

1316
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:19,469
We barely completed the first half.

1317
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:21,550
One, two, three!

1318
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,699
The durability of this product
is entirely different

1319
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:29,099
that has never been seen
in the previous models.

1320
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:31,520
Dong Woo successfully adjusted
into his new work life.

1321
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:35,090
Any other ideas?

1322
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:43,809
I'd like to propose an idea
for a new product.

1323
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:47,429
It's a cup with a built-in blender.

1324
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:50,650
I named it, "Tornado in my hand."

1325
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,139
He didn't give up on comics.

1326
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:11,019
He continued drawing after work
and posted them on his blog.

1327
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:13,869
"Invasion From Planet Penis"
now has a substantial fanbase

1328
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:15,870
and it's enjoying
great popularity online.

1329
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,499
Chi Ho finally found a purpose in life.

1330
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,590
Something no one expected.

1331
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:28,210
Dad, I've decided to make movies.

1332
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:29,540
I'm going to be a movie director!

1333
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:32,639
Honey.

1334
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:35,220
Get me some aspirin.

1335
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:40,409
Ready.

1336
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:41,640
Action!

1337
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:44,119
Okay!

1338
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:46,039
- Get me my pills now!
- Ready!

1339
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:47,350
Action!

1340
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,120
Action!

1341
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:09,609
Look at this bastard...
Director!

1342
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:11,310
Director! Hold on!

1343
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:14,780
Director! Director!

1344
01:47:15,890 --> 01:47:17,019
Director!

1345
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:19,879
Chi Ho's ill-tempered boss
was his biggest obstacle.

1346
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:23,429
He came up with seven
different plans to murder him

1347
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:25,130
but then fought off the temptation.

1348
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:26,360
- Are you okay?
- The knife!

1349
01:47:32,210 --> 01:47:36,139
He proved everyone wrong
by sticking it out for three days.

1350
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:37,539
Hey, get over here!

1351
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:38,780
Yes, sir!

1352
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,330
Hey, what's with your grades?

1353
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:08,540
I'm a college student. Whatever.

1354
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:10,530
You're still a student.

1355
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:13,699
You sound like my mom.

1356
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:15,959
I lost my entire savings
on stock trading.

1357
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:17,950
Even though it was cyber money.

1358
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:20,220
I joined a new club shortly afterward.

1359
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:27,090
- All right!
- Let's go.

1360
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,919
Do you want to go for a spin,
Kim Kyung Jae?

1361
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,090
Yes!

1362
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:36,349
I'm sure there will be countless times
of trial and error ahead of us

1363
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:40,229
but we've got plenty of times to
turn back around if we take a wrong turn.

1364
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:43,110
I guess that's why people
call it "the good times."

1365
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:45,539
Our roaring...

1366
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:47,500
Kyung Jae. You got a military
conscription notice.

1367
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:54,549
What's with the face?
Won't you see Sam Hammington there?

1368
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:57,669
The Australian man? How great!

1369
01:48:57,670 --> 01:49:00,249
You all applied to go together, right?

1370
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:01,620
With Chi Ho and Dong Woo.

1371
01:49:01,630 --> 01:49:03,459
What? Are you serious?

1372
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:05,520
What?

1373
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:15,990
Fuck.

1374
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:24,120
I'm leaving... Damn.

1375
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:30,509
We decided to go on a cross-country hike
a week before entering the army.

1376
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:35,829
It felt like a cool thing to do
to walk to the training base.

1377
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:37,719
Hey you morons.

1378
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,460
I told you this was a stupid idea.

1379
01:49:39,470 --> 01:49:42,409
Is this cool to you? Is it?

1380
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:45,209
Does it feel cool to pass out
even before we get there?

1381
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:47,869
What kind of bullshit is this?

1382
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:50,920
I was going to get a bonus next month.

1383
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:54,220
I think this country does nothing for me.

1384
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:56,199
Blame your nationality.

1385
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:59,850
Despite everything... I won't be bitter.

1386
01:50:00,370 --> 01:50:02,220
No, I won't be!

1387
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:07,660
What a moron.

1388
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:11,429
Okay, let's go! How bad could it be!

1389
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:13,009
Yeah! Let's do it!

1390
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:14,650
Screw you!

1391
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:19,439
Whatever comes next and after that...

1392
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,449
we'll be fearless and ready for it.

1393
01:50:21,450 --> 01:50:24,689
Because we're in our roaring twenties!

1394
01:50:24,690 --> 01:50:27,999
- This feels great!
- This is so nice!

1395
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,469
I have a confession to make to you guys!

1396
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:35,260
I'm dating So Hee!

1397
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:44,120
You all right?

1398
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:49,800
Did you sleep with her?

1399
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:54,529
- Well...
- Don't answer that.

1400
01:50:54,530 --> 01:50:55,880
Answer him.

1401
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:57,500
Tell him that it's not true.

1402
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:04,119
I feel like...

1403
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:05,770
Would lying about it change anything?

1404
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,669
Among the two friends I've got...

1405
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:17,140
one screws his friend's ex...

1406
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:20,610
and the other guy
screws his friend's sister.

1407
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:25,020
Isn't it a weird turn of events
that I'm the most normal one here?

1408
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:32,270
Listen, man. We've had our share of
differences, but we've overcome them.

1409
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:35,069
Kyung Jae, that rock's lodged in there.
It's stuck, man.

1410
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:36,930
You're not that kind of guy.

1411
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:40,160
He dislodged it.

1412
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,370
Kyung Jae.

1413
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:44,559
Let's think this through.
You're a sensible guy.

1414
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:46,200
Kyung Jae, Kyung Jae...

1415
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:51,319
I love So Hee!

1416
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:54,299
- Come here!
- I'm in love with So Hee!

1417
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:57,310
I'll kill you!

1418
01:51:58,230 --> 01:52:02,349
Get over here! I'll kill you

1419
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:06,910
I love So Hee!
